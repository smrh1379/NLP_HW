was a strange old time when the creature feature mash-up Godzilla vs Kong was released, the first major blockbuster in cinemas since Covid shuttered them all a year prior. Expectations were low, thanks to how rotten the last two Godzilla films had been, but thirst for something, anything, truly escapist was high and the big screen equivalent of a kid smashing his toys together became an unlikely saviour, both commercially and critically.Three years later with normality resuming, there\u2019s arguably less audience demand for another instalment, although the industry could definitely do with another monster hit, the strikes leaving the first few months of 2024 a little weakened. There\u2019s enough easily marketable simplicity to Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire that it should become a swift global hit (the film is tracking to make $135m worldwide in its opening weekend) but, especially in the shadow of the Oscar-winning Godzilla Minus One, there will be predictably diminishing returns for those who venture out. It\u2019s a still fun yet far sloppier outing, a second round that\u2019s less of a win for us and more of a draw.We start out with a truce of sorts. Godzilla remains king, and protector, of the regular world, fighting off creatures of the week when they surface while Kong stays down in the Hollow Earth, the magical other space discovered in the previous film. But their time out is coming to an end, spurred by some dental issues for poor Kong whose infected tooth, and maybe sad sack loneliness too, thrusts him back to humanity. Something greater is also at play, plaguing the dreams of Jia (Kaylee Hottle) who shares a bond with Kong and now lives with her adopted mother (a returning Rebecca Hall), that requires the arch enemies to go from v to x.What made the last film such a success was the director Adam Wingard\u2019s neat modulation of tone, removing the dank portent of Gareth Edwards\u2019s maddeningly self-serious 2014 offering and bringing the fun that Michael Dougherty\u2019s piss-poor sequel failed to deliver. He\u2019s been wisely brought back for more and it\u2019s refreshing to see him keep things light, his film a brash pop of colour at a time when too many tentpoles of this scale get lost in murk (it\u2019s surely the pinkest Godzilla movie to date). But the script, from a team of three, also trying to keep things breezy, is far less effective. Human time is of course never going to be a priority in these films (Wingard even admitted that they would be of even less importance this time around) but dialogue frequently dips from merely perfunctory to actively dreadful. In trying to align itself with Wingard\u2019s zippiness, the script punishes us with quippy banter so astonishingly, embarrassingly unfunny, we find ourselves pleading with Godzilla to silence them all with one of his feet.Hall is ever luminous to watch and deserves every bit of her paycheque for playing Mrs Exposition in the last act but one does miss watching her play a real person, a joy that we haven\u2019t had in a while. Dan Stevens and a returning Brian Tyree Henry are both lumped with the comedy and both struggle to make any of it work, which for a portion of the middle stretch, devoid of crashing and smashing, starts to become a problem. But when we return to the action, it\u2019s hard not to feel an itch being scratched, the basic child-like satisfaction of watching giant monsters square off proving to be just as entertaining as we want it to be. Wingard is again able to choreograph and structure large-scale fights with coherence and logic, especially in the eye-popping final act, taking on a four-way battle and never causing us to zone out (many a Marvel director could do with watching and learning).It\u2019s, obviously, these moments of shock and awe that we come to a Godzilla and Kong movie for but with a two-hour runtime to fill, we start to feel the limitations here more than we should. We\u2019re still supposed to egg the adversaries on for the sake of humanity not secretly hope they might destroy them in the process. If the next chapter ended up being Godzilla Minus People, that wouldn\u2019t be a loss.Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is out in cinemas on 29 March","1":"Brilliant, entrancing, exhausting, and with thermonuclear showtunes from Richard and Robert Sherman, Disney\u2019s hybrid live-action\/animation classic from 1964 is now rereleased on home entertainment platforms for its 60th anniversary. And it has a brand-new certificate from the BBFC: upgraded from a U to a PG on account of \u201cdiscriminatory language\u201d from the eccentric seadog character Admiral Boom, who fires a cannon from his roof shouting \u201cFight the Hottentots!\u201d (an obsolete term for South Africa\u2019s indigenous Khoekhoe people). However the BBFC is evidently not bothered by the foxhunting scene in which the fox has a cod Irish accent (perhaps because chimney sweep Bert, played by Dick Van Dyke, saves the fox), nor by the cheerful suicide reference made by one of the servants: \u201cNice spot there by Southwark Bridge, very popular with jumpers!\u201dIn an upmarket part of Edwardian London created on almost dreamlike artificial sets in California, the prosperous upper-middle-class Banks family are having problems controlling their high-spirited children, Michael (Matthew Garber) and Jane (Karen Dotrice); this is grumpy banker George Banks (David Tomlinson) and his suffragette wife Winifred (Glynis Johns), who is always whirling around going to votes-for-women marches. Pompous Mr Banks saunters into the action with complacent song The Life I Lead (which melodically owes a tiny bit to With a Little Bit of Luck from the stage show My Fair Lady).And so the magical nanny Mary Poppins wafts miraculously down from the heavens to solve all their problems \u2013 and this is the glorious movie debut of Julie Andrews, glowing with health and beauty and confidence. Andrews will always be associated with this superb performance, and of course her later appearance in The Sound of Music, in which she also artlessly cures a family\u2019s woes. I have always preferred Andrews in The Sound of Music, because defying the Nazis is more exciting and worthwhile than wimpishly going on a jolly holiday, and feeding the (verminous) birds at tuppence a bag etc. But no one can doubt the lethal power of Mary Poppins. (Naming Mary\u2019s preferred alcoholic cocktail is always a great film quiz standby.)But when uptight Mr Banks takes the kids to his place of employment and young Michael inadvertently causes the biggest run on a bank since Frank Capra\u2019s It\u2019s a Wonderful Life, this stern paterfamilias loses his position and is forced to consider his whole life and how he has been neglecting his children in favour of work (although happily it\u2019s not a quandary he\u2019s in for very long).It is Mary who introduces the children to the madcap chimney sweep Bert, played by Van Dyke with his notoriously awful cockney accent \u2013 which is even more awful considering that Hermione Baddeley is right there, robustly playing the Banks family\u2019s maid Ellen, and giving us a much more convincing London voice. (Actually, Van Dyke\u2019s posh voice as old Mr Dawes is much better.) From the first time I saw this film as a kid, and again now, I have always wondered: are Bert and Mary in love or not? Mary sings to him: \u201cGentlemen like you are few \/ Though you\u2019re just a diamond in the rough, Bert \/ Underneath, your blood is blue \/ You\u2019d never think of pressing your advantage \/ Forbearance is the hallmark of your creed \/ A lady needn\u2019t fear when you are near \u2026\u201d Pressing his \u201cadvantage\u201d? A lady not needing to fear? Well, I should hope not, though perhaps poor Bert certainly does have a hopeless platonic thing for Mary, possibly the most romantically unattainable figure in film history. She is also arguably a manic pixie dream nanny, though it\u2019s Bert who is also manic, particularly when he does his interminable Step in Time rooftop knees-up with all the other sweeps.There are lots of genius moments here, and A Spoonful of Sugar and Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious are amazing songs. I have to admit that I find the real brilliance of the film is in the first act and things have wound down by the end, but what an entertainment sugar rush.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotion Mary Poppins is in UK cinemas from 29 March, and also screening in select Australian cinemas.","2":"The cuddly kung fu master is back. Jack Black returns as dumpling-loving panda Po, the unlikeliest of lean, mean fightin\u2019 machines. It\u2019s been eight years since Kung Fu Panda 3, and on the evidence here, the delay can\u2019t be put down to KFP4 being a labour of love, the product of animation studio DreamWorks\u2019 A team pouring in enormous amounts of effort. It\u2019s a hurricane of slapstick (some of it in fact very funny) and age-appropriate energetic fight scenes, but lacks the sweetness and charm of the franchise at its best. It failed the wriggle test on my seven-year-old cinema date, who was squirming in her seat around the hour mark.The plot is a bit overfussy for its target audience of small kids, though the scriptwriters have been careful to make it work for newbies \u2013 no previous Kung Fu Panda experience necessary. It opens with Po being promoted from his role as Dragon Warrior to spiritual leader of the valley, taking over from his mentor Shifu (Dustin Hoffman \u2013 no expense has been spared on the vocal cast). But before he can appoint his successor, Po apprehends Zhen (Awkwafina), a streetwise thieving fox. The two of them make a brilliant double act: Black is adorable, Awkwafina terrific as the cynical wisecracker.Zhen warns Po about a dangerous new villain, the sorceress Chameleon (Viola Davis), who turns out to be pretty unmemorable as far as the franchise\u2019s baddies go (not a patch on Ian McShane or Gary Oldman in the earlier movies). The two biggest giggles in the cinema came from the grownups: first, in a hilarious scene involving bulls in a china shop; then some wry chuckling when Po tries to meditate \u2013 his thoughts quickly straying to his tummy: \u201cInner peace \u2026 inner peace \u2026 dinner please \u2026 dinner with peas.\u201d But the seven-year-old shrugged and said, half heartedly: \u201cThe panda is \u2026 fun.\u201d Kung Fu Panda 4 is already playing in the US and is in UK and Irish cinemas from 28 March.","3":"Short of presenting nothing more than music and a blank screen, this documentary about the late Japanese composer-performer Ryuichi Sakamoto\u2019s last appearances is as stark and minimal as a concert film can get. And yet it\u2019s a work suffused with emotional tones and shades, surprisingly not all of them sad even though the subject knew at the time of filming he had mere weeks left before he\u2019d die of cancer.There are moments when director Neo Sora, Sakamoto\u2019s son, turns up the lighting for the more upbeat songs and we can see the master smile, pleased with his own performance, or the composition, or \u2026 we know not what, as there is almost no dialogue, no nattering about the life. We had all that in an earlier documentary, Ryuichi Sakamoto: Coda. In Opus it is the music, played by the man himself, that is completely sufficient to the moment and all that remains, with the occasional very human stumbles and missed notes. When he says he needs a break for a while, exhausted by a performance, the strain is painfully visible, audible, practically palpable.Shot in black and white with silvery shades of grey, the camera tends to track slowly or pan leisurely, in sync with the lento to moderato tempi of his playing. Sometimes we focus just on his hands, all the better to appreciate the way he occasionally conducts for himself with his right. Elsewhere, the camera pans up to his face, that shock of white hair, those signature round tortoiseshell spectacles. All the way through, the sound is rich as could be, exquisitely recorded in Sakamoto\u2019s favourite studio.As one might expect given the circumstances, the music selection spans his career \u2013 from soundtrack work for The Sheltering Sky, The Last Emperor and Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence, to adaptations of songs recorded with the electronic trio Yellow Magic Orchestra from the 1970s, and on to cuts from his later collaborations with German musician Alva Noto. The austerity of the film-making affords a rare chance to meditate on his range and the variety of his work as well as the consistency of his voice as a composer. Ryuichi Sakamoto: Opus is in UK cinemas from 29 March.","4":"The only daughter in a family of nine Iranian-American siblings, Leila\u2019s (Layla Mohammadi) relationship with her mother, Shireen (Niousha Noor), was strained even before she got pregnant after a one-night stand with a drag artist. But, Leila learns, the wedge between them has its roots in a family scandal in rural Iran from before she was even born. With its boisterous, excitable energy and highly spiced colour palette, The Persian Version initially comes across as a broadly comic crowd-pleaser: a kind of My Big Fat Iranian Unplanned Pregnancy.But there\u2019s rather more to it than crass cultural stereotype. Maryam Keshavarz\u2019s drama is an astute dissection of mother-daughter discord; it\u2019s perceptive and candid in its insights into the push-pull cultural struggle experienced by second-generation immigrants. And it features an infectiously joyous extended family dance sequence set to Cyndi Lauper\u2019s Girls Just Want to Have Fun. If the final act overdoes it a little with the wackily-ever-after feelgood vibes, Mohammadi\u2019s flippantly acidic to-camera commentary emphasises the sharp edges within the family embrace.","5":"It\u2019s an almost entirely dialogue-free animation, captured with pleasingly simple, almost naive 2D character design. The warm and disarming storytelling is bolstered by the film\u2019s unassuming use of humour. But come to Robot Dreams well stocked with tissues: Pablo Berger\u2019s exquisite, bittersweet, Oscar-nominated buddy movie about the bond between a dog and a robot matches Spike Jonze\u2019s Her as one of cinema\u2019s most devastating and profound studies of loneliness and the fragility of emotional connections. If any further evidence were needed to support the theory that we are enjoying a new boom time for quality animation, then this is it.The appealingly clean, uncomplicated character design is based on that of the source material, a graphic novel by American author and illustrator Sara Varon. She has made something of a career from exploring odd-couple relationships: one of her other books, Bake Sale, is about the friendship between a cupcake and an aubergine. Another, Chicken and Cat, is playfully referenced in Robot Dreams, namechecked on the buzzer for the apartment below that of Dog.Home for Dog is a modest third-floor apartment in New York\u2019s East Village in the 1980s. It\u2019s a solitary existence: the shelves are full of jigsaw puzzles and the freezer is well stocked with microwave macaroni cheese meals for one. But life in 80s New York City is not designed to be experienced solo. Bathed in the borrowed light from his TV screen, Dog slumps on his sofa and plays Pong against himself. Picking listlessly at his cheesy pasta gloop, he scrolls through the television channels for something to distract himself from the happy couple snuggling in the window across the street. And then he sees it: an advertisement for a robot companion, the Amica 2000. Pretty soon, accompanied by a jaunty, optimistic piano and xylophone ditty, Dog assembles his new flat-packed friend.The bond is instant. Bucket-headed and wide-eyed, Robot approaches the city with a sense of wonder. And through his friend\u2019s hunger for discovery, Dog starts to rediscover New York as a place to be embraced and experienced, rather than watched, wistfully, from his living room window. In a blissful montage set to Earth, Wind & Fire\u2019s September (a recurring musical motif, used to increasingly wrenching effect), the buddies scoff down hotdogs from street vendors, watch an octopus busker bashing drums on the subway, rollerskate together in Central Park. At the end of a fun-packed summer the pair venture to the beach at Coney Island, where Robot flings himself, literally, into the seaside experience.Then disaster strikes. The saltwater short circuits his power bank and Robot is left, immobile, on the beach. Unable to lift his metal bestie, Dog returns the next day with his toolkit, only to discover that the beach has closed for the season and won\u2019t reopen until the following June. Rusting at the edges and exposed to the elements, Robot lies patiently in the sand. When he sleeps, he dreams of reuniting with Dog. The ache of enforced separation is dulled by brief connections \u2013 Robot with a family of birds that nest in his armpit; Dog with a cool female Duck, who rides a motor scooter, wears Air Jordans and knows how to fly a kite. But both Robot and Dog are counting the days until they can be reunited again.There\u2019s such tenderness to the storytelling, such empathy and emotional depth, that it broadens the film\u2019s potential audience from kids, who will respond to the cute characters and gentle wit, to adolescents and adults, who will recognise the angst and awkwardness of trying to function alone once again. What is perhaps remarkable is that this is Berger\u2019s first animated film. The multi-award-winning Spanish director was previously best known for Blancanieves, a reimagining of the Snow White story set in 1920s Seville, and Torremolinos 73, a droll comedy about a struggling encyclopedia salesman who stumbles into the world of adult cinema.What Berger has created with Robot Dreams is not just one of the finest animations of recent years; it\u2019s also one of the most persuasive love letters to the city of New York. The time and location are etched in affectionate details into every frame, from the period-specific graffiti to the cultural references (Dog is visited by a trick-or-treating sloth dressed as Freddy Krueger), to the East Village in-jokes (a rented VHS of The Wizard of Oz comes from Kim\u2019s Video, a now fabled video store that was run from the back of an East Village dry cleaners). It\u2019s a city that is vibrantly present in the film\u2019s evocative sound and meticulously captured in the background design. But, as Dog and Robot discover, it fully comes to life when it\u2019s shared.","6":"A malign presence lurks in the corner, insidiously leaking poison into our minds; it\u2019s ubiquitous and addictive. Small wonder that genre film-makers have long toyed with the idea that television is inherently evil.Late Night With the Devil, a gleefully wigged-out found-footage horror by Australian brothers Cameron and Colin Cairnes, joins a growing list of films tapping into the dark side of the small screen. It\u2019s a list that includes Hideo Nakata\u2019s Ringu, David Cronenberg\u2019s Videodrome, Tobe Hooper\u2019s Poltergeist and the buzzy forthcoming title from Jane Schoenbrun, I Saw the TV Glow. Unlike most of the other examples however, Late Night\u2026 focuses not on the passive consumption of television, but on its creation. The film hints at a Faustian pact that trades dignity, honesty, morality and even human lives to claw a share of the ratings figures. Which, when you think about it, is not so very far-fetched.Smart, cynical and at times devilishly funny, the film delivers a crackle of disruptive static to the demonic possession genre. It takes the form of a long-lost master tape and backstage footage from an ill-fated 1977 Halloween special of Night Owls, a struggling syndicated evening talkshow fronted by host Jack Delroy (a note-perfect David Dastmalchian, all slippery neediness and insincerity). Facing cancellation, Jack and his producer have pulled out all the stops: the fright-night special features a psychic, a cynic and, as the star attraction, a parapsychologist and a demonically possessed 13-year-old girl (an impressively disquieting Ingrid Torelli). The scene is set for a live attempt to commune with the devil. But first, a message from the sponsor\u2026","7":"Of all the hot takes you expect to see when you go to the cinema, the suggestion that Mahatma Gandhi was overrated is perhaps low down the list. But this Hindi biopic of Hindu nationalist leader Vinayak Damodar Savarkar (directed and co-written by Randeep Hooda, who also stars as Savarkar in a committed and involving performance) argues exactly that, although it\u2019s careful to have Savarkar note: \u201cI don\u2019t hate Gandhi, I hate non-violence.\u201d Okay then. In general, the stance across the nearly three-hour runtime is that, in contrast to the famous maxim, the sword is in fact mightier than the pen, with Savarkar exhorting followers to \u201cget rid of your pen and arm yourselves\u201d.What is odd is that the film doesn\u2019t make more use of its own subject\u2019s principles. Much ink has been spilled over the issue of whether on-screen violence is too glamorous, too appealing\u2013 but apparently, the makers of Swatantara Veer Savarkar are unaware of what a powerful weapon cinematic images can be, because in a biopic attempting to eulogise a man they depict as having advocated strongly for violent revolution, they don\u2019t deliver much in the way of action.Where it would have seemed like an open goal, considering this biopic\u2019s political agenda, to make Savarkar into a heroic figure who physically battles his enemies, in fact he spends much the hefty runtime studying law in the UK, having little chats in libraries with figures like Lenin, and, for a long stretch in the second half, suffering in the notorious Cellular Jail where the British tortured political prisoners. Of course, making the guy into a macho commando type when he wasn\u2019t like that in real life would have involved playing fast and loose with the facts \u2013 but the film doesn\u2019t seem too bothered about that elsewhere, for example glossing over unsavoury details like his real-life support for Adolf Hitler\u2019s Germany, where Savarkar\u2019s speeches were published approvingly in newspapers. It all adds up to a funny mixture of hagiography and limp film-making, albeit built around a fine central performance. Swatantra Veer Savarkar is in cinemas now.","8":"There are no leprechauns in this abysmal romantic comedy. Otherwise, though, pretty much no theme-park Ireland cliche is left unturned in a Lindsay Lohan vehicle, directed by Janeen Damian, that reimagines Irish Catholicism as a twinkly, impish delivery system for magical realist plot devices.Lohan plays Maddie, a book editor who is devastated when her secret crush, dashing author Paul Kennedy (Alexander Vlahos), gets engaged to her best friend, Emma (Elizabeth Tan). Invited to be a bridesmaid at the wedding at the Kennedy stately home somewhere in Ireland, Maddie wishes that she, not Emma, was the lucky bride-to-be. And Saint Brigid, patron saint of headscarves and romantic meddling, overhears. Of course, wishes have a way of backfiring, and amid all the spontaneous outbreaks of Irish dancing and Guinness drinking, Maddie realises that her heart lies elsewhere. On Netflix","9":"Late 90s and early 00s cinema wasn\u2019t all bad, but it was responsible for a crop of particularly dismal crime flicks. Including pictures such as the now notorious Rancid Aluminium, these were painfully contrived and agonisingly ironic winks to camera, made by film-makers who watched the movies of Tarantino and the Coen brothers and figured, how hard can it be? So it\u2019s disappointing that Ethan Coen\u2019s solo directorial outing (his brother Joel having already ventured out alone with the sombre, stylised The Tragedy of Macbeth) is a 90s throwback that feels closer in tone and quality to his imitators than it does to the Coens\u2019 original work, even at their most flippant and featherlight.An enthusiastically trashy lesbian road movie that Coen co-wrote and collaborated on extensively with his wife, Tricia Cooke, Drive-Away Dolls stars Margaret Qualley as free spirit Jamie, and Geraldine Viswanathan as her uptight friend Marian. The pair embark on a spontaneous road trip in a Dodge Aries that needs to be delivered to Tallahassee. But there\u2019s something unsavoury hidden in the vehicle, and a couple of inept criminals on their tail. The film has a boisterous energy, but it\u2019s puerile, phoney and frequently rather cringe.","10":"British human rights activist Muhammad Rabbani had been stopped and interrogated at the UK border on several previous instances \u2013 the consequence, he says wryly, of being a Muslim man with a beard. But this time was different: the interviewer asked for the password to his electronic devices, and when Rabbani refused \u2013 his clients are vulnerable, their information highly sensitive \u2013 he was arrested and charged.Kate Stonehill\u2019s eye-opening and at times slightly muddled documentary uses Rabbani\u2019s case as a jumping-off point to explore the Orwellian surveillance activities of the UK; the potential for abuse of Schedule 7 of the 2000 Terrorism Bill and the terrifying amounts of data about each one of us that can be mined from our mobile phones.","11":"The new boy (Aswan Reid, electric) is delivered to the Christian mission at night, tied in a hessian sack like a wild animal. And that\u2019s how the white world of 1940s Australia views Indigenous Australian kids like him \u2013 as feral, unpredictable creatures in need of civilisation.Through the lens of her fervent faith, Sister Eileen (Cate Blanchett) can see that there is something special about the child \u2013 he picks up snakes the way other children collect pebbles; he can soothe a fever with just his hands. And he can create a floating spark of light \u2013 a plaything and comfort for him in the long, strange nights in the mission dormitory. But the boy\u2019s otherness is alarming to her, something that needs to be contained and reshaped.The latest film from Warwick Thornton (Samson and Delilah) is strikingly beautiful, its widescreen vistas rendered in a scorched palette of dust and ochres. But the pacing is languid to a fault and it all gets rather bogged down in allegory.The New Boy is in UK cinemas now and on Binge in Australia.","12":"Before Richard E Grant\u2019s Withnail, there was Kenneth More\u2019s Chick Byrd. In Alvin Rakoff\u2019s 1964 British drama, Byrd is an out-of-work actor whose breezy, cynical exuberance masks increasing terror of permanent unemployment and, like Withnail, he is desperate for his agent to call, stunned by his flatmate booking a glamorous film job and stuck living in a scuzzy boarding house in Camden Town (although exteriors were shot in Paddington).After being fired from his job in provincial rep, Chick has come back down to London to try his luck, meeting up with all the old faces, the familiar parade of ageing thespian losers hanging round West End pubs and cafes during the day and mooching desolately past theatres with huge hoardings showing rave reviews for successful actors. Jaded, nasty agent Tommy Morris (Dennis Price) has no time for Chick, and neither does the raffish Prout (Frank Finlay), while slippery actor Rutherford (Cecil Parker) owes him money. But he meets up with old flame Judy (Billie Whitelaw) and a new one, Fay (played by More\u2019s future wife Angela Douglas). And then, when something terrible happens to his pal Jack Lavery (Alan Dobie), Chick makes an awful decision which gets him a kind of fame and fortune, at a price.It\u2019s all performed with manic gusto and plenty of zip in the dialogue, and the opening scene, with Chick\u2019s chaotic curtain-call speech, is in fact rather amazing. But it has to be said there is something a bit dated and tatty in the wrong ways about The Comedy Man, and for me this is down to More, a performer who is oddly pompous and self-satisfied in what is supposed to be a comedy role, albeit a melancholy one. He never looks like a professional actor, more like a golf club bore who fancies himself something of a card. Of course, Chick is supposed to be insufferable \u2013 but is he supposed to be quite that insufferable? And then there are the moments of casual misogyny and homophobia, which of course modern audiences can be aware of and even make allowances for, but are here not redeemed by any great wit or humanity in the way they might be for other pictures of the era.Having said all this, it is solidly performed by its blue chip cast \u2013 though how sad to see Dennis Price, the legendary star of Kind Hearts and Coronets, not being properly used in a British film. It\u2019s a vivid glimpse of early 60s Britain. The Comedy Man is on digital platforms, DVD and Blu-ray on 18 March","13":"We all know (and are largely complacent) about the limitless possibilities for digital surveillance and data collection by corporations intent on selling us things, or using our existence to sell advertising. Kate Stonehill\u2019s film is about the more old-fashioned subject of state surveillance and specifically the existence of a disquieting new programme in the UK nicknamed \u201cPhantom Parrot\u201d: the practice of remote spying on mobile phone use.Stonehill\u2019s film is also about schedule 7 of the 2000 Terrorism Act, which gives the police powers to search people at UK borders, without needing explicit grounds for suspicion on terrorism. That legislation was brought in before the smartphone was invented, but means that officers can demand detainees hand over their PINs and passcodes to all devices on pain of prosecution and a three-month prison sentence. Because, for all that almost all the information exists on external servers and the cloud, there are still some things which are only held on this handset, to which most of us entrust our entire existence.This was the fate of Muhammad Rabbani, international director of Cage, the group which campaigns for Muslims held under war-on-terror laws, who was held in 2016 on returning from Qatar for refusing to hand over his PIN. So without ever having been convicted of anything, and for having entirely reasonable concerns about privacy and confidentiality as it might affect other people, citizens can find themselves criminalised.Rabbani was represented by the veteran human-rights lawyer Gareth Peirce (played by Emma Thompson in Jim Sheridan\u2019s 1993 movie In the Name of the Father, about the Guildford Four case). Peirce is shown speaking to various human-rights groups and notes that we have become desensitised to state abuse: \u201cThe capacity to be shocked is important.\u201d (True enough, although many still had this capacity in 2015 when Cage\u2019s research director Asim Qureshi publicly called Islamic State killer Mohammed \u201cJihadi John\u201d Emwazi a \u201cbeautiful young man\u201d.) Well, this is another valuable film about the digital war on privacy. Phantom Parrot is in UK cinemas from 15 March","14":"Ben Mullinkosson is a film-maker and skateboarder from Chicago who brings an effortless, freewheeling intimacy to this immersive and sensual study of the underground club scene in Chengdu in central China. The title is enigmatic, but it seems to refer to the imminent closure of a club called Funky Town where his subjects have been hanging out; the darkness is the club\u2019s darkness, which is enfolding and welcoming and reassuring, a neon-detailed night in which nothing matters but youth, beauty and the pleasure of the moment.Mullinkosson is utterly at home and embedded with his group of friends \u2013 clubbers, performers, musicians \u2013 with whom he hangs out while they (utterly unselfconsciously) get very drunk; and in fact the spectacle of people throwing up in the street becomes a bit of a motif. He isolates a very strange setpiece in which a young woman rocks back and forth in the foreground as a prelude to a gruesome vomiting episode while two people in the background chatter away, entirely unconcerned.Mullinkosson also gets up close and personal while people kiss, or fight. He is alongside a couple who have gone to a high rooftop to see the sunrise over the breathtaking sci-fi vastness of the city, and sees a woman who is depressed clearly flirt with the idea of taking her own life as she stumbles morosely to the edge to see the view better. Another character confesses candidly to having been molested on a certain spot as a seven-year-old. A drag artist has a kind of existential crisis (\u201cI don\u2019t even like seeing myself as a girl\u201d).The director brings his movie to a kind of vibey, coming-of-age climax to David Bowie\u2019s Life on Mars and there is something very sad in seeing all the people involved bidding a kind of complicated, conditional farewell to hedonism. The Last Year of Darkness is on Mubi from 15 March.","15":"This intriguing sci-fi thriller is a throwback to the kind of cerebral teleplays and low-budget movies that flourished in the 1960s: ripe with gloomy lighting and dystopian pessimism, but with barely enough money in the budget to pay for more than two sets. Think On the Beach from 1959, or Seconds from 1966 \u2013 but then lower your expectations because it\u2019s not anywhere in their league. But it\u2019s not bad, and the subject is timely.The time is a couple of decades in the future, and humanity has accepted that we\u2019ve messed up the planet beyond repair. The only answer is to start colonies off-world, starting with the moon. Helping to sow these seeds for the future is an AI called Jay that runs simulations to calculate risks and resolutions. All that is explained in a crawl and with faux news footage. The drama properly begins at a rural house that looks like something from Grand Designs; it\u2019s the home of Jay-creator Sam (Kemi-Bo Jacobs) and astronaut Anderson (Simon Merrells, one of those actors you\u2019re sure you\u2019ve seen before even if you can\u2019t quite place him). He is going to be the head of the next crucial mission to the moon, which launches tomorrow. The couple\u2019s last night together is interrupted by the arrival of Sam\u2019s employee Charlie (Hermione Corfield), who is troubled that Jay\u2019s simulations posit not a trip of a few days but one going to the Jupiter moon Europa, and from there the titular million days journey to Alpha Centauri. Quicker than you can sing \u201cDaisy, Daisy, Give Me Your Answer Do,\u201d the trio start to suspect Jay has gone rogue and has her own agenda.Apart from a few moonlit wanders outside to look for a missing dog, and a flashback to a deep-space mishap rendered with visual effects, everything takes place inside Sam and Anderson\u2019s house. That minimalism is fine, making for an interesting contrast with the vast distances and time spans conjured by the dialogue. But a bit more fluidity and flair in the script would have been welcome, cleaning up the clunky, exposition-heavy lumpiness of it all. A Million Days is on digital platforms on 18 March","16":"Imagine your husband, or your friend\u2019s husband, or even your friend, has a pal you\u2019ve never met named Ricky Stanicky. This invisible Stanicky character never visits, barely calls and seems to have about one crisis a year \u2013 testicular cancer, or a surprise return from charity work in Kenya, or rehab. This would probably be dubious at best, and baseline annoying. Then suppose this Stanicky calls with a medical crisis in the middle of a baby shower, taking two of the hosts away and causing one to miss the birth of his child. That would definitely be annoying.Such is the baseline feeling of watching Ricky Stanicky, a new Amazon buddy comedy directed by genre veteran Peter Farrelly, which doesn\u2019t have enough heart to overpower its puerile humor or its characters\u2019 generally objectionable schemes. For Ricky Stanicky, the person, is a made-up character on which three childhood friends, Dean (Zac Efron), JT (Andrew Santino) and Wes (Jermaine Fowler), have blamed two decades\u2019 worth of misbehavior, starting with accidentally burning someone\u2019s house down in a Halloween prank gone awry.In their adult years, Ricky Stanicky is an agreed-upon excuse \u2013 with a literal book of backstories and a fake Instagram account to boot \u2013 to get away from their pesky partners, turn off their phones and get blasted during times of responsibility. Times such as the aforementioned baby shower for JT\u2019s wife Susan (Anja Savcic), which the guys ditch for, of all things, a Marc Rebillet concert in Atlantic City, leaving Susan, Dean\u2019s wife Erin (Lex Scott Davis) and Wes\u2019s boyfriend Keith (Daniel Monks) to handle things.Comedy protagonists don\u2019t have to be sympathetic, of course \u2013 some of the best, from Wedding Crashers to the Always Sunny gang, have been scoundrels. But they do need to be funny, and unfortunately, these three guys are neither. The joke that they\u2019re immature wears thin fast; the banter feels as stale as flat beer, which is not helped by some very obvious Dos Equis product placement. At the bar, they meet a weirdo named Rod (John Cena), a failed actor turned \u201cSouth Jersey\u2019s premiere X-rated rock and roll impersonator\u201d who they dismiss as \u201cWeird Al Wankovic\u201d. But when the gang accidentally misses the birth of JT\u2019s son, resulting in one furious mother-in-law (Heather Mitchell), two skeptical wives (women are so pesky!) and one annoyed boyfriend (gay men can be annoying, too!), they know just the unrecognizable actor to call in for the bris \u2026Cena has long demonstrated his impressive gameness to play the joke, and his commitment to the bit of an overly pathetic Rod, an alcoholic failure who performs masturbation-themed karaoke, transforming into the worldly, suave do-gooder Ricky Stanicky is admirable. If only the material deserved it; part of the gag involves staging several Cena-in-musician drag performances to demonstrate Rod\u2019s piteousness, including the lyrics \u201csplooge out my penis! Splooge on my tummy!\u201d to the tune of Alice Cooper\u2019s School\u2019s Out. (Ricky Stanicky boasts a team of writers including Farrelly, Jeffrey Bushell, Brian Jarvis, James Lee Freeman, Pete Jones and Mike Cerrone, with a story by David Occhino and Jason Decker; I have to imagine these bits killed in the room.)Cena as Rod\/Ricky is the only endearing character in the bunch, so it\u2019s a bit entertaining when he kills it as Stanicky, endearing himself to Dean and JT\u2019s boss (William H Macy), scoring a job at their finance company and a fluffy news story by Erin, an extremely beleaguered journalist. Dean and JT scramble to sabotage their hanger-on to greatly diminished comic returns. At least Efron, who has long delivered charm in films beneath him (his admirable awards play in last year\u2019s The Iron Claw notwithstanding) can\u2019t help but make Dean a little sympathetic, even with an eye-roll inducing late-stage excuse for his lying. Santino, primarily a comic, fares much worse \u2013 JT leaves a sour taste throughout. Fowler\u2019s Wes acts as the film\u2019s chaotic neutral: he\u2019s a stoner for laughs, suggests maybe they tell the truth and casually defuses boilerplate homophobia from acquaintances.There are a few laughs but, at nearly two hours, Ricky Stanicky far outstays its welcome. Farrelly\u2019s direction isn\u2019t remarkable enough to rise above the unlikability of its heroes nor the persistent dick\/masturbation jokes, though he did succeed in making Melbourne, Australia, pass for an indistinct version of Providence, Rhode Island, (save for a few extras\u2019 Aussie accents) and in hiring several actors with disabilities. And in making me wish for more for Efron, Cena and everyone else involved. This gang turns out just fine, of course, but it\u2019s an uneasy hang.Ricky Stanicky is available on 7 March on Amazon","17":"\u201cJoe \u2026 be gentle with me \u2026 \u201d It\u2019s easy to imagine this demure invitation to premarital sex getting some ribald hooting in British cinemas in 1959. Jack Clayton\u2019s multi-Oscar-winning film was adapted by Neil Paterson from John Braine\u2019s moody, zeitgeisty bestseller, and it\u2019s rereleased now with the traditional trigger warning about offensive and outdated attitudes. Now, that could mean pretty much everything about this film \u2013 but without doubt it is specifically aimed at Hermione Baddeley praising the hero\u2019s manliness and grimacing: \u201cToo many pansies about these days \u2026 \u201dRoom at the Top gave us Laurence Harvey as Joe Lampton, the smouldering, ambitious young working-class Yorkshireman with a chip on his shoulder and a burning desire to get on, and get laid. Achieving both, he calculates, could mean getting engaged to a rich young woman after (or during) the sowing of wild oats elsewhere to which he considers himself fully entitled. But he\u2019s terrified of being tied down. So Joe is the poster boy for what no one in 1959 called toxic masculinity.Joe travels from his modest home town of Dufton to the fleshpots of Warnley where he\u2019s got a job in the town council\u2019s accounts department. After impressing the typing pool with his good looks (including a simpering young secretary wonderfully played by Prunella Scales), he pals up with co-worker Charlie Soames (Donald Houston) who tells him about the fancy houses for posh people up the hill, the town\u2019s \u201cTop\u201d; Charlie introduces him to the amateur dramatic society where he fatefully meets and falls for two separate women. One is the comely young Susan Brown (Heather Sears), daughter of the town\u2019s plain-speaking plutocrat who is robustly played by Shakespearean legend Donald Wolfit. The other is the worldly, blowsy and sensationally sexy older woman Alice, unhappily married and played by Simone Signoret. (The character, English in John Braine\u2019s novel, is now French.) Joe and Alice have an affair using the flat belonging to Alice\u2019s friend Elspeth (Baddeley).In truth, Signoret probably outclasses everyone in the movie with her charisma and address to the camera. But Harvey\u2019s performance, though more effortful, still has vigour and style. This is an angry-young-man drama from the grimmer and more serious end of the spectrum; it is pretty humourless compared to John Boulting\u2019s Lucky Jim (1957) or John Schlesinger\u2019s Billy Liar (1963), which Room at the Top nevertheless resembles in its drama of class conflict and male frustration in a world where nice girls wouldn\u2019t or if they did pregnancy was shatteringly immediate. In this it is closer to Karel Reisz\u2019s Saturday Night and Sunday Morning (1960), whose hero also has a relationship with an older married woman, and Lindsay Anderson\u2019s This Sporting Life (1963). Freddie Francis\u2019s cinematography is extraordinarily good; he makes these country towns look pretty much as exciting as London or New York and he contrives some tremendous closeup compositions of people\u2019s faces looming disturbingly out of the screen in foreground and background, years before Brian De Palma\u2019s \u201csplit diopter\u201d lens effects in movies like Carrie.It\u2019s certainly a film for the Talking Pictures TV audience, and it\u2019s a pungent time capsule for postwar Britain where nasty snobbish remarks could be exchanged at the Rotary club. Maybe it\u2019s not a masterpiece but it still packs a punch, and the scene at the end, where the audience overhears some awful news just before Joe does, is very powerful. Room at the Top certainly defined the life of author John Braine who wrote a sequel, Life at the Top (also filmed with Harvey, in 1965) and scripts for a continuing TV drama based on his athletic Lothario in an act of wishful-thinking autobiographical fiction which earned Braine the mockery of his contemporary and frenemy Kingsley Amis. Harvey himself would go on to make more of an impression in The Manchurian Candidate, but here he still looks like an old-school movie star. Room at the Top is on digital platforms, Blu-ray and DVD from 11 March.","18":"\u201cI paint because I need to.\u201d The revelation of this new documentary about Frida Kahlo (yes, another one) is the white-hot brilliance of her writing. On the voiceover, Kahlo tells her story in her own words, stitched together from letters, diaries and interviews (brought to life by Mexican stage actor Fernanda Echevarr\u00eda del Rivero). The end result has a raw, thrilling intimacy.Kahlo was rebellious by nature. As a little girl she tugged on the priest\u2019s cassock: \u201cWas the virgin Mary really a virgin?\u201d At college, on course to become a doctor, she wore men\u2019s suits; in old photos, she looks like a beautiful boy. Then came the life-changing accident that nearly killed her. Aged 18, Kahlo was travelling on a bus that collided with a tram. \u201cThe handrail went through me like a sword through a bull,\u201d she remembers. In a hospital bed for months \u2013 \u201ctrapped alone with my soul\u201d \u2013 she began painting. Kahlo\u2019s intensely autobiographical canvases appear on screen as she describes the moods and events they depict.Controversially, director Carla Guti\u00e9rrez animates some of Kahlo\u2019s work. So the hair on the floor in Self-Portrait with Cropped Hair (painted after separating from her husband, Diego Rivera), comes to life, fluttering down to the ground. These bits have outraged some Kahlo fans. What\u2019s all the fuss about, I wonder. Can it really be worse than plastering her work over tea towels?Then there\u2019s a fascinating section where Kahlo describes stepping out of Rivera\u2019s shadow; it\u2019s like a manifesto. After a devastating miscarriage, she became obsessed with \u201cstarting over\u201d and \u201cpainting things how I saw them, through no one else\u2019s eyes\u201d. She regretted wasting \u201cmy best years on a man\u201d. After divorcing, Rivera begged her to marry him again, and Kahlo agreed on two conditions: a) she would pay half of everything; b) they would never have sex with each other. (The infidelities on both sides had been epic: she slept with Trotsky; he slept with her favourite sister).Each new sentence adds more: more complexity, more woman. There\u2019s the anguish and vulnerability of living with chronic pain; Kahlo is scorchingly sexy too (her love letters practically pulse with desire). She is savage about her enemies (watch out Surrealists) and swears like a trooper. On a visit to New York, where the monied art world is fawning over Rivera, Kahlo sticks a pin in his ego: \u201cDiego is big shit here.\u201d Frida is in UK cinemas on 8 March and on Prime Video on 14 March.","19":"Both Fifa and the UK\u2019s Football Association have had an awful lot to be ashamed of over the years, but hardly anything as bad as the breathtakingly spiteful, sexist and dishonest way they treated women\u2019s football in the last century, particularly after the spectacular success of the 1971 Women\u2019s World Cup in Mexico, an independent event defiantly held outside Fifa\u2019s pompous auspices and discussed now in this riveting documentary.An independent women\u2019s football association had held its inaugural Women\u2019s World Cup in Italy in 1970 with sponsorship from Martini vermouth. Then, a year later, they staged their ambitious Copa 71 in Mexico with fixtures in two national venues which Fifa couldn\u2019t control: the Jalisco stadium in Guadalajara and, in Mexico City, the Azteca stadium. The capacity crowds and the euphoric atmosphere were staggering. So conditioned are we to the sexist view of football that the extraordinary archive footage of the crowds for Copa 71 feels like some alt-reality hallucination. But afterwards the FA and Fifa dedicated themselves, almost like the Men in Black waving their amnesia devices in everyone\u2019s face, to denying its success, forgetting it ever happened, clamping down on the venues and facilities and punishing the women for their success.The documentary shows us that throughout the 20th century, the authorities had an almost pathological suspicion of women\u2019s football, despite or because of the evidence that it could attract large crowds; they promoted the fatuous theories that football was bad for women\u2019s health and (in spite of the evidence) that it was bad box office. There is an element of reactionary class prejudice to go with the misogyny in their attitudes: large crowds supporting women triggered an almost atavistic horror in the blazer-wearing chaps. This film speaks to the international players in all the teams from Copa 71 now and it\u2019s a joy to listen to their memories \u2013 particularly Britain\u2019s engaging and funny Carol Wilson who, like so many, was badly treated afterwards by the mediocre menfolk.Copa 71 is a revolutionary political parable that goes beyond football. A different world is possible; not only that, a different world was not just possible but did in fact exist. But the narrative was erased. Well, it\u2019s been restored by this bracing and thoroughly absorbing film. Copa 71 is in UK and Irish cinemas from 8 March.","20":"With a film set in rural India in 2001, Mumbai Diaries\u2019 Kiran Rao directs a tale of two newlywed couples taking a long journey by train to set up their new homes in different villages. Changing trains by night in a rush, one groom grabs the hand of the wrong woman and hustles her off the train with him. The mistake isn\u2019t discovered until they reach his village. Anyone who sits down to this gentle comedy-drama on the basis that its wife-swapping premise sounds like a saucy throwback to the Confessions of a Window Cleaner-style romps of Britcoms past is in for a sad disappointment, but they\u2019ll find themselves entertained nevertheless.It\u2019s not quite as implausible as it might sound: both marriages are arranged, so the couples aren\u2019t familiar with each other, and the brides are both veiled in strikingly similar red marital garments. Plus, it\u2019s late, it\u2019s dark, it\u2019s crowded \u2026 look, you\u2019re just going to have to go along with it. There\u2019s even an argument that the classical implausibility of the mix-up helps situate the story in the realm of Shakespearean comedies, where people are constantly passing themselves off as long-lost gender-switching brothers and sisters. The secondary cast of characters underline this: Chhaya Kadam as the no-nonsense station tea shop owner and Ravi Kishan as a grimacing police officer feel like exactly the kinds of character roles you can imagine Miriam Margolyes or Simon Russell Beale getting their teeth into in an English-language version.On the other hand, there is so much about Laapataa Ladies that feels culturally specific, so perhaps an English language version would be a horrible idea. The script, by Sneha Desai, Biplab Goswami and Divyanidhi Sharma, is alive to the social nuances for women in this particular context \u2013 Pratibha Ranta and Nitanshi Goel play characters who feel rather differently about their marriages, and who land in very different milieu as a result of the mix-up. The film is neither fully condemnatory of arranged marriages, nor starry-eyed about the practice, allowing for a gentle probing of perspectives. Laapataa Ladies is in cinemas from today","21":"On the face of it Jermain Defoe, former Tottenham and England goal ace, is perhaps a slightly unlikely figure to get his own documentary, even in this era of wall-to-wall streaming events. He never quite achieved the super-elite status of his England colleagues Wayne Rooney or Steven Gerrard; nor has he established a similarly fond niche in the public imagination as Peter Crouch, whom he partnered up front at both Portsmouth and Tottenham. In fact, Defoe\u2019s story, as outlined here, is in some ways the rags-to-riches tale common to many footballers in the modern era, though perhaps more turbocharged than most given his obvious precocity as a schoolkid.Defoe offers a disarming kind of honesty, mulling over the effect on his life of his largely absent father who, it appears, spent much of his time in a West Ham United-adjacent boozer, and expanding on his admiration for his unswervingly loyal mother. He also touches on a personal life that can only be described as \u201ccolourful\u201d, suggesting that a need to not be seen as dependent left him something of a commitmentphobe, to put it mildly. (Even the undignified public scuffle over a failed paternity test gets a mention, with Defoe adamant he was delighted to be a father, as he thought he was going to be.) It is, however, his connection with Bradley Lowery, the six-year-old Sunderland supporter with neuroblastoma who died in 2017, that perhaps elevates Defoe\u2019s story towards some kind of sense of redemption; it\u2019s not too softhearted to agree that, yes, Lowery was the child Defoe has not yet had himself.In all, Defoe comes out of this film pretty well: top-level sports stars are evidently the driven, ultra focused kind of people that don\u2019t really do self-reflection, but Defoe has enough about him to make himself look unusually vulnerable, commendable in a film that otherwise seems to function as a job pitch for a future career in management. As a film, this documentary is not really pulling up any trees, but it gets across a sense that Defoe wants a bit more out of his life than simply playing football. \u201cIt\u2019s more than just kicking a ball,\u201d he says, and he\u2019s got more than a few emotional battle scars to show for it. Defoe is in UK cinemas on 29 February for one night only.","22":"This film hits just about every sweet spot possible: it is Icelandic and shot on black and white stock; it is a quirky road movie set in an unlikely place (Iceland); and it has a cute dog and features characters who knit. What is not love? If there had been cats and Ian McShane in a supporting role, it might have got five stars.However, writer-director Hilmar Oddsson doesn\u2019t need to pander to specific tastes because it\u2019s clear he knows exactly what he\u2019s doing with this happy-sad comedy-drama, a film that hovers on the emotional cusp between tones with consummate skill. The story unfolds in long, languid, static takes, signalling both a kind of arthouse melancholy that at the same time reads as faintly comical, setting up a frame for funny business to take place within its confines, provided the timing is just right.It most certainly is here, thanks not just to Oddsson but also his cast, led by Thr\u00f6stur Le\u00f3 Gunnarsson as Jon, a lonely farmer living in an isolated part of Iceland. In fact, the homestead is so remote, the easiest way to reach it is by boat. Jon, a middle-aged bachelor, lives with his widowed mother (Kristbj\u00f6rg Kjeld), and their perky sheepdog Bresneff (Dreki, a very good boy indeed). Jon and Mamma knit sweaters using the hearty bulky-weight lopi wool which they sell through a local cooperative. Given the story is set vaguely somewhere in the 1970s or 80s, there\u2019s no internet or TV, just cassette recordings of old news bulletins that the boatman delivers when he comes to collect the finished sweaters.One night, sour-faced Mamma dies. Jon feels obliged to honour her last wishes to dress her corpse up in her finest clothes, apply heavy makeup and drive her to the town on the other side of Iceland where she was born to be buried. Bresneff comes along for the ride, looking alert in the front seat while Mamma is strapped in the back of Jon\u2019s Ford Cortina, lookingas if she\u2019s just nodded off. She may be dead but that doesn\u2019t stop her from having conversations with Jon, criticising his life choices like the time he fell in love with a girl named Bergdis (Hera Hilmar). As the journey progresses, he imagines he sees Bergdis in every passing woman with long hair, and slowly he begins to thaw out and open up to the strangers he meets.The comic style is reminiscent of Finnish auteur Aki Kaurismaki, especially the deadpan way the film uses music. At the same time, this is very much an Icelandic film, one that celebrates the breathtaking emptiness of the landscape. Given how often the country is used to stand in for all manner of other places \u2013 imaginary (see Game of Thrones) and real (it substituted for Alaska on the recent season of True Detective) \u2013 it\u2019s nice to see Iceland play itself for a change. Driving Mum is in UK cinemas from 1 March.","23":"A strain of science fiction has emerged lately, especially in Europe and more specifically France, that\u2019s very sparing with visual effects and more dependent on tricks involving makeup and sets, sprinkled with a bit of body horror, \u00e0 la David Cronenberg. French director Thomas Cailley\u2019s The Animal Kingdom, which debuted in Cannes and played at the London film festival but has yet to open in the UK, is very much in this style, with genetically mutated people turning into animal-human hybrids \u2013 lizards, birds, all manner of mammals \u2013 and leaving the civilised world behind.Tropic, a film directed by \u00c9douard Salier, who has a horror feature, Cabeza Madre, under his belt, and lots of shorts and music videos \u2013 is in a similar vein. It outlines a near future where humanity has accepted that Earth is a lost cause \u2013 not just because of climate catastrophe but also because the sun will engulf it in about 5bn years\u2019 time, so it\u2019s best to start planning ahead. To that end, school-age youngsters are training to be astronauts on fiercely competitive and academically challenging courses. Non-identical twin brothers Trist\u00e1n (Louis Peres) and L\u00e1zaro (Pablo Cobo) are both enrolled and hope to get chosen to go up to space together on a so-called eternity voyage. Trist\u00e1n is stronger, and more confident than his brother; their Spanish, working-class single mother Mayra (Marta Nieto) jokes that when twins are born, one comes out the arse, and it\u2019s a family tradition that L\u00e1zaro \u2013 the shy one who can\u2019t hold his breath as long underwater and hasn\u2019t yet had a girlfriend \u2013 is that one.All that changes one day when the boys are swimming at a local watering hole and some space debris crashes into it. L\u00e1zaro gets out with minimal damage, but for sketchily defined reasons Trist\u00e1n develops a bacterial infection that leaves him with brain damage, vastly decreased mobility, and half the skin on his face looking like bubble wrap. He\u2019s siloed off to the special needs division of the school with other kids with complex issues, some of them wheelchair users, but seemingly most disturbed and emotionally scarred. Neurodivergent Oscar (Alane Delhaye), for instance, delights in reciting super-misogynistic rap lyrics while another (Victor Robert) scrolls through a Tinder-style app, saying to each image: \u201cYou\u2019re ugly.\u201dYes, of course, there are young men with special needs who exhibit such antisocial, aggressive behaviour. But the fact that the film doesn\u2019t present any mitigating or counterbalancing characters leaves a little bit of an ableist bad taste in the mouth, and also seems to imply that only perfectly fit, white ubermensch chaps like Trist\u00e1nn before the accident and L\u00e1zaro are worth conserving. Andrew Niccol\u2019s Gattaca back in 1997 explored similar territory but felt much more questioning of that kind of eugenicist nonsense. It\u2019s not so clear where Salier wants his audience to land morally. There\u2019s a strong sense of atmosphere, however, and the three actors who play the nuclear family at the heart of the film impress throughout and feel convincingly like a tight family unit. Tropic is on digital platforms from 4 March.","24":"Here\u2019s an existential sci-fi wearing its influences and its supposed humour really heavily, as if entering some super-gravitational force field. It is adapted by screenwriter Colby Day from the absurdist Czech novel Spaceman of Bohemia and directed by Johan Renck, who has lately worked mostly on television, notably on the Chernobyl drama series. The resulting Netflix movie is a lifeless space oddity about a commercially sponsored Czech mission to the stars, whose astronaut has to repeat the ad slogans in his radio contact with Earth, always a laboured type of satire.This Czech spaceman is quirkily and improbably sent out to the far reaches of the galaxy to investigate clouds of glowing particles hanging around from the big bang. But all those months alone in space bring him to the edge of insanity, and he begins to hallucinate that a huge spider is in the spaceship, talking therapeutically about the spaceman\u2019s failing marriage. Or maybe the spider is real.But there are no Czech actors in the film and so the comedy of non-Americanness and non-Nasaness in this Czech space mission is lost, and even the implied Tarkovskian mock-Solaris pastiche doesn\u2019t quite work either. Adam Sandler is the haggard and bearded Jakub up there in space, and Carey Mulligan is his pregnant wife Lenka down on the home planet, broodingly hanging round the gloomy house; her video message to her husband that she is leaving him is suppressed by the flight commander at mission control, played by Isabella Rossellini. The enormous spider, voiced by Paul Dano, keeps on addressing Jakub as \u201cskinny human\u201d \u2013 odd, as the spider is much skinnier than the human. How many humans has the spider seen?The ostensible humour is assigned of course to this enormous talkative arachnid, like a twee unscary version of Alien. Sanders and Mulligan get no funny lines of any sort, a shame as we know that they can both play comedy. (And Rossellini was in 30 Rock.) As Jakub\u2019s craft drifts out into the golden-hour sunset-hued nimbus clouds of stars, the apparent transcendent experience triggers flashbacks to the first moments of his relationship with Lenka, and we go into a sub-Malick trance. As for Lenka, her role is woefully under-written and under-imagined; we don\u2019t really know or feel how she could have fallen in love with Jakub, or why exactly she\u2019s fallen out of love with him \u2013 or why she seems now, as part of some cosmic-epiphanic miracle of intergalactic sympathy, to be kind of falling back in love with him all over again. It\u2019s a spaceflight to nowhere. Spaceman screened at the Berlin film festival. It is released on 23 February in US and UK cinemas, and on 1 March on Netflix.","25":"During their time as a film-making team, Joel and Ethan Coen developed a reputation for uncanny synchronization, said by their collaborators to always give the same answer to any question even if asked separately. The brothers came to be called \u201cthe two-headed director\u201d, but their respective features apart suggest a surgical detachment less than a single brain split in twain.A study in contrasts, the works produced during their brief hiatus \u2013 they\u2019re rumored to already be back together, hard at work on their first foray into the horror genre \u2013 have given the impression of a single sensibility divided up evenly between them. Joel\u2019s austere, atmospheric take on Macbeth ridded itself of all levity along with its color, and now, Ethan\u2019s road comedy Drive-Away Dolls barrels into their shared oeuvre as its goofiest, loosest entry. Joel\u2019s solo project mined the history of American experimental theater for a bold, charcoal-sketched revision of the Bard\u2019s canon; Ethan\u2019s sexploitation send-up revolves around a handful of pilfered dildos.Far from the result of a trade-off between discipline and personality, however, this bawdy Sapphic joyride is also far from minor Coen miscellanea. It might seem like Ethan (along with wife and longtime editor turned co-writer Tricia Cooke, whose queer identity puts more of her skin in this particular game and complicates questions of authorship) has marshaled the usual plot devices toward broader, more sophomoric ends. We have an errant briefcase nicked from No Country for Old Men, a pair of hitmen \u2013 following Fargo\u2019s chatterbox\/misanthrope pairing \u2013 hot on its trail, and a loquacious wiseacre in the mold of O Brother, Where Art Thou\u2019s Ulysses Everett McGill one step ahead of them on the lam. As incorrigible horndog Jamie (Margaret Qualley, her accent like Tommy Lee Jones speaking at 1.5x speed) and buttoned-up Marian (Geraldine Viswanathan in the straight-man role, so to speak) blaze a path to Florida in a rented car with some unexpected precious cargo, they take a route dotted with recognizable narrative landmarks.But just as the Gulf war period piece The Big Lebowski ferreted away some bruising jabs at American political pathologies in offhanded remarks about Saddam and Bush Sr, Drive-Away Dolls situates its libido-drunk wild goose chase on the eve of Y2K, the twilight of Clintonism and the eve of a conservative resurgence. It\u2019s fresh territory for the Coenverse to annex, as novel as a sense of humor dumbed-down enough to allow for a sight gag involving a tiny, humping dog. And in the most intriguing new variable of all to this auteurist formula, there\u2019s a surprising openness of sentiment, offering the sweetest love story in a filmography constantly, erroneously charged with a self-satisfied ironic remove from its own characters. Jamie\u2019s out here looking for a good time, and the film giddily obliges her without assuaging her suspicion that there might be a little more to life.The archness of technique that\u2019s turned off a vocal faction of detractors has been dialed way back, the allusive streak more incidental than insistent. Jamie mentions having seen a movie like this while re-enacting the notorious glowing-briefcase shot from Kiss Me Deadly, but this is mostly a matter of vibes; Coen and Cooke have admitted that they drew influence from their own half-formed notions of sleaze champions like Doris Wishman and Russ Meyer rather than their actual work. (The real key reference may be Dr Strangelove, which first posited the theory that war, government and the ideologies behind them all stem from the sexual neuroses of resentful, insecure men.) The essence of the Coenesque comes through strongest in the pristine dialogue, with its baroque turns of phrase, absurd circular repetitions, and idle philosophical musings. It\u2019s just that this time around, the trademark colorful verbiage has been applied predominantly to euphemisms for getting off.Whatever liberation comes with this shedding of seriousness also has its costs, most noticeably in the directorial rigor a notch or two below the standard. Perhaps the preternatural ability to place the camera in the funniest, cleverest spot belongs to Joel, though a tender moment spent lingering on the light from a swimming pool playing on the wall posits a more emotional, associative visual language. The characters want to get their rocks off, and the Coen-Cooke braintrust likewise get their stylistic kicks, indulging in wipe-style scene transitions so cheesy that a viewer\u2019s reaction to the first one determines whether they will come along for the trip or get left behind. Interspersed passages of hazy psychedelia padding a svelte 84-minute runtime (featuring none other than Miley Cyrus, graciously undeterred by a lack of lines, as radical visual artist Cynthia Plaster-Caster, to whom the film is dedicated) take tripping literally, and risk comparison to the bumpers from That 70s Show.\u201cAfter 30 years, not that it\u2019s no fun, but it\u2019s more of a job than it had been,\u201d Ethan Coen presumably sighed in a 2022 interview. A wild detour chock-a-block with wild detours, Drive-Away Dolls comes from an artist regaining his capacity to take pleasure in the process, no matter if that means slackening the laser-focused perfectionist streak evident even in his earlier comedies. Contrary to its easygoing casual gait, this is an essential work in the Coen corpus, an evolution more than a regression or sacrifice. It\u2019s the rare case in which a preponderance of dick jokes heralds a newfound advance in maturity.Drive-Away Dolls is out now in Australian cinemas, in US cinemas on 23 February and in the UK on 15 March","26":"The second part of Denis Villeneuve\u2019s monumental Dune adaptation lands with a sternum-juddering crash; it\u2019s another shroom of a film, an epic sci-fi hallucination whose images speak of fascism and imperialism, of guerrilla resistance and romance. Villeneuve\u2019s adaptation of Frank Herbert\u2019s 1965 novel \u2013 working with co-writer Jon Spaihts \u2013 draws on David Lean, George Lucas and Ridley Scott\u2019s Gladiator in the (perhaps inevitable) mega-stadium combat scene with the tiny billions of CGI crowds in the bleachers. But he really has made it all his own: secular political cruelty meets Indigenous people\u2019s struggle in those vast mysterious planetscapes. The sound design throbs and drones in this film\u2019s bloodstream, lending a queasy frisson to its extraordinary visual spectacle and the recurrent horror-fetish BDSM chic which appears to govern so much intergalactic-wrongdoer style.My only reservation is that some of the momentum that the first part had built up has been lost since that movie was released more than two years ago. Those outside the existing Dune fanbase could feel that the ending does not deliver the resounding closure to which we all might, maybe naively, consider ourselves entitled to at the end of 330 minutes total screen time. And the final eventful moments of the film feel a bit rushed, as if Shakespeare had decided to shrink Henry VI Part III into a zappy coda to go at the end of Part II.None of that damages the film\u2019s flair and staggering display. We begin with another extraordinary and surreal desert-battle scene with the invented technological detail that is so commanding and distinctly scary, as if we are witnessing a posthuman evolutionary development. The signature design touches are presented with absolute confidence; in any other film, those black nasal tubes would look odd, especially when the two leads are expected to kiss while wearing them. Here you accept it.We are on the planet Arrakis, with its hugely lucrative mineral resource of Spice, under the hideously corrupt Harkonnen rule, having brought off a duplicitous coup against the Atreides family, to whom the emperor had assigned administration rights. The Harkonnens are the gruesome Baron (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd) and his creepy nephews Beast Rabban (Dave Bautista) and the even creepier Feyd-Rautha, played by Austin Butler. The charismatic Paul (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) is still gallantly fighting with the Fremen insurgency, in love with Chani (Zendaya) and considered by warrior Stilgar (Javier Bardem) to be their messiah. But Paul\u2019s mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), part of the occult Bene Gesserit sisterhood, is with him also, taking her own place in the Fremen power structure. A great reckoning between the Fremen and the Harkonnen is approaching, and between Paul and the Emperor and his daughter Princess Irulan; these latter are slightly perfunctory roles for Christopher Walken and Florence Pugh.It\u2019s a panorama of shimmering strangeness, now expanded to include a bigger cast, with L\u00e9a Seydoux on classically feline and insinuating form as the Bene Gesserit initiate Lady Margot Fenring and a tiny, almost subliminal cameo for Anya Taylor-Joy. As before, the second Dune film is superb at showing us an entire created world, a distinct and now unmistakable universe, which will probably be much imitated: a triumph for cinematographer Greig Fraser and production designer Patrice Vermette. Hans Zimmer\u2019s score provides exactly the right tone, at once plangent and grandiose.Villeneuve shows such ambition and boldness here, and a real film-making language. But I can\u2019t help feeling now, at the very end, that though it\u2019s impossible to imagine anyone doing Dune better \u2013 or in any other way \u2013 somehow he hasn\u2019t totally got his arms around the actual story in the one giant, self-contained movie in the way he got them around his amazing Blade Runner 2049. There\u2019s no doubt that Chalamet carries a romantic action lead with great style, even though there is so much going on, with so many other characters, that his heroism and romance with Chani is decentred. But this is a real epic and it is exhilarating to find a film-maker thinking as big as this. Dune: Part Two is out on 1 March in the UK and US, and on 29 February in Australia.","27":"The work of film-makers Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger is discussed with passion and authority by Martin Scorsese in this richly enjoyable documentary, for which he presents his thoughts and recollections directly to camera. When the British establishment shamed itself by turning its back on these homegrown masters, it took this Italian American film-maker to rediscover them in the 1970s \u2013 and now the Powell\/Pressburger films almost cannot be seen except through the medium of Scorsese\u2019s glorious evangelism; their movies and his have virtually become intertextual events.As he takes us through the great Powell\/Pressburger films such as The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp, I Know Where I\u2019m Going!, Black Narcissus, Red Shoes and The Tales of Hoffmann, Scorsese also plays clips of his own films, including Raging Bull and The Age of Innocence, showing how he had been influenced by these predecessors. How remarkable that a movie director who came of age in the era of gritty violent realism \u2013 precisely that movement which supplanted the romantic idealism of Powell and Pressburger \u2013 was to give them a second lease of life.Famously, or notoriously, Powell had become an un-person in British cinema during the 60s, unable to work after critics and distributors had an immoral panic about Peeping Tom, the satirical horror masterpiece that Powell had directed on his own. The film dared to mention the dark voyeurism and hypocrisy detectable in the movie business, the tatty porn economy that helped keep it afloat and the nasty, un-bohemian reality of Soho and the West End where reviewers went to work every day. (Peeping Tom is, as I keep saying, the middle serial-killer film in the overall P&P canon, together with the \u201cglue man\u201d in A Canterbury Tale and Powell\u2019s TV opera Bluebeard.)Scorsese, who had discovered the Powell\/Pressburger movies on TV, sought out Powell and effectively brought him back to Hollywood where he ended up marrying Scorsese\u2019s inspired editor Thelma Schoonmaker; it was the cine-creative equivalent of a royal alliance. And inevitably perhaps, given this personal connection, his emphasis is on Powell rather than Pressburger, who was himself living in relative English obscurity, although writing novels, one of which was adapted for the cinema. (The biography by Pressburger\u2019s grandson Kevin Macdonald is probably the place to go for an in-depth study.)But the Powell\/Pressburger relationship is one of the most fascinating dualities in movies. They were both credited as writers, producers and directors. \u201cWho called \u2018Cut\u2019?\u201d Scorsese remembers wondering as a young man. The answer seems to have been Powell himself, although the directing input of Pressburger was there at a more conceptual level, manifesting itself in their discussions and script conferences, and such a fiercely opinionated man as Powell would naturally never have consented to co-billing without being convinced it was right.Powell and Pressburger emerge from this film, more than ever, as sui generis: inventors of their own kind of film, gentleman amateurs of cinema in some ways \u2013 although Powell had served a rigorous apprenticeship working for the Irish silent movie director Rex Ingram. But in a way the Powell\/Pressburger movies were a kind of manuscript culture in cinema; they did what they wanted, as if their work was only to be circulated among like-minded souls.Scorsese shows that wartime and the need for propaganda were strictures that paradoxically liberated them to make films which certainly didn\u2019t look like propaganda (in contrast, for example, to In Which We Serve or Mrs Miniver). In fact, The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp from 1943, with its irreverent attitude to the military and the insistence on the existence of good Germans, was famously disliked by Winston Churchill. The result was a movie poetry quite different from anything anyone could have dreamed of, although with the war movie The Battle of the River Plate in 1956 they showed they could do straight genre pictures when required.The title of this film \u2013 Made in England \u2013 is of course what was stamped on the screen at the end of their Tales of Hoffmann. But Scorsese allows us to absorb the tacit paradox that their films were also made in Hungary, in Germany and in France. Powell and Pressburger were an international powerhouse, not a little-Englander sentimentality factory.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotion Made in England: The Films of Powell and Pressburger screened at the Berlin film festival.","28":"Described as \u201cthe greatest band you\u2019ve never heard of\u201d, Cymande was formed by Windrush-era Caribbean musicians in early 70s south London. Their infectious fusion of jazz, funk and soul was warmly received in the US but largely fell on deaf ears in the UK. In 1975 the band split. The music lived on, however, rediscovered as samples in hip-hop and as floor-filling staples of the rare groove club scene.Tim Mackenzie-Smith\u2019s slightly breathless and overstretched documentary aims for a Buena Vista Social Club-style story of late-life rediscovery but gets a little bogged down in a few too many hagiographic quotes from high-profile fans. Still, the music is sublime.","29":"What starts as a pastiche of a classic western \u2013 Viggo Mortensen stars as a stranger in a hostile frontier town \u2013 takes a sudden swerve into the unexpected when the story baton is passed to a put-upon present-day female cop working a night shift in a Native American reservation. Then, through a magical realist flourish featuring a large bird, the location switches again, this time to the Brazilian jungle some time in the past.This shape-shifting picture from experimental Argentinian director Lisandro Alonso is a formally inventive exercise, one that weaves together meditations on Indigenous peoples and the spectre of colonialism in a form unlike anything you will have seen before. Unfortunately, for all its daring, Eureka is often stultifyingly slow. An interminable static shot of someone sitting glumly in a corridor lasts so long that time slows down, life loses all meaning and, one by one, your brain synapses start to atrophy.","30":"Sumptuous, sensual and impossibly handsome, at first glance French-Vietnamese director Tran Anh Hung\u2019s lavish foodie romance The Taste of Things looks like just another decorous prestige period drama. But in its elegantly restrained way, Tran\u2019s film, which is set almost entirely in the kitchen, grounds and dining room of the country chateau of famed gourmet Dodin (Beno\u00eet Magimel) in 1880s France, is every bit as radical and risk-taking as some of the showier, quirkier awards contenders this year (it was France\u2019s submission for this year\u2019s international Oscar category, chosen over Anatomy of a Fall, but failed to make the final list).Take its exquisite opening sequence. Starting with a wordless nod of approval from Dodin\u2019s celebrated cook, Eug\u00e9nie (Juliette Binoche), as the gardener hands her a gnarled, freshly exhumed celeriac root, the film then gets down to the serious business of cooking. Around 35 minutes, much of it dialogue-free, is dedicated to the meticulous preparation and appreciative consumption of a feast. In a fluidly choreographed dance of the camera and characters, Eug\u00e9nie is joined in the kitchen by Dodin, kitchen assistant Violette (Galat\u00e9a Bellugi) and Violette\u2019s niece Pauline (enchanting newcomer Bonnie Chagneau-Ravoire).Aside from the remarkable technical accomplishment of this sequence, you are struck by the audacious daring of easing us into a film with a tranquil, uneventful study of chopping, sieving, tasting and savouring that lasts for more than half an hour. Given the pressure from streaming platforms for film-makers to open their movies with full-throttle, audience-grabbing plot dumps, Tran\u2019s decision seems defiant and almost subversive.This luxurious, leisurely opening allows us to fully explore and feel our way around the relationship between Dodin and Eug\u00e9nie. He is her employer, certainly, but it\u2019s obvious from the outset that, both in the kitchen and outside it, they are equals. More than that, there\u2019s an effortless intimacy in the way they move around each other; the way their heads almost touch as they confide over the precociously sophisticated palate displayed by the untrained but entranced kitchen newbie, Pauline. But it\u2019s not until the evening, when the plates have been licked clean and the last of Dodin\u2019s guests has waddled home that we learn not only that Eug\u00e9nie and Dodin are long-term lovers, but also that the relationship is conducted on Eug\u00e9nie\u2019s terms. Over a twilight digestif, accompanied by a chorus of cicadas, he asks her to marry him and she gently demurs: it\u2019s a conversation that has clearly played out on countless occasions over the past 20 years. Dodin persists nonetheless.Tran, whose previous films include the similarly evocative and slow-burning The Scent of Green Papaya, makes a point of emphasising the parallels between the sensual experiences of food and those of the flesh. The grunts and moans of gratification emanating from Dodin and his foodie chums as they wear the traditional napkin over their heads to conceal the shameful decadence of scoffing an ortolan sound positively coital (a now outlawed delicacy, the tiny songbird would be force-fed, drowned in Armagnac then chomped down in a single mouthful). And while I adored the mischief of cutting straight from a luscious and inviting poached pear to a shot of Binoche\u2019s delectably peachy naked bottom, nobody could accuse Tran of being subtle in his symbolism.Yet once again, The Taste of Things defies expectations. There is something refreshingly unconventional about its depiction of the tender, well-worn love between Eug\u00e9nie and Dodin. It\u2019s not just that they are an older couple \u2013 Dodin describes them both as being in the autumn of their lives; Eug\u00e9nie prefers to think of herself in a permanent summer \u2013 there\u2019s also the point in the relationship at which we join them. Cinema tends to be fascinated by the high-stakes drama and intensity of new love or the brutal evisceration of its final moments. Far fewer films explore the comfortable familiarity of a love that has endured and deepened over decades. Vanishingly rare are pictures that capture this kind of relationship so satisfyingly.There\u2019s a serene emotional harmony between Dodin and Eug\u00e9nie, but also an enduring, intensifying pleasure in each other\u2019s company. It\u2019s a pleasure that is expressed through food rather than words. Dodin\u2019s longing is folded into the paper-thin pastry of a dessert created for the ailing Eug\u00e9nie. An omelette, cooked with love and eaten with a spoon, is as pure and heartfelt as a sonnet.","31":"Olivier Assayas\u2019s new film is a flimsy but elegant autofictional sketch about his own experiences during the Covid lockdown, bubbling up with family members in his childhood home in la France profonde. It\u2019s a movie which reminds us that for all the anxieties, this period of enforced inactivity was for grownups of a certain age and financial security not entirely unpleasant \u2013 a reminder of the endless, aimless summer days of childhood, an Edenic existence outside time which workaholic media professionals thought never to see again. A kind of miracle.Vincent Macaigne plays dishevelled film-maker Paul (very different, surely, from the stylish Assayas), who has come back to the handsome family home of his late parents, staying there with his girlfriend (Nine d\u2019Urso) and communicating with his ex-wife and adored tween daughter on Zoom. He is going to be living there with his brother Etienne (Micha Lescot) a music journalist and his new partner (Nora Hamzawi). Assayas uses what appears to be his actual home and in his opening autobiographical voiceover introduces us to the house and grounds - easily the best part of the film, actually - and in further personal sections dispenses with the fiction and talks about the \u201cAssayas\u201d family.Etienne is in a position to record radio programmes at home and gets started on a show about music stars who have died of Covid, starting with Dave Greenfield of the Stranglers. (For a second, I was hoping Assayas would break out some choice Stranglers tracks, with Etienne playing air guitar. But sadly no.) Paul has little to do but mooch about the place, musing on ideas for films. Paul\u2019s obsessive anti-Covid cleanliness soon irritates Etienne who annoys Paul with his cooking. But of course there are meals and laughter too.Nothing illustrates the difference between French and British cinema more than this film. Which Brit director would be allowed to indulge himself or herself with this civilised, cultured musing? And to assume that of course there is a supportive home-turf audience for it? This is a film in which someone sits down and listens to a podcast with Jean Renoir talking about his father Pierre-Auguste Renoir \u2013 and it\u2019s really interesting. Well, I\u2019m glad that Assayas is allowed to do it. Hors du Temps (Suspended Time) screened at the Berlin film festival. This article was amended on 19 February 2024 to correct the names of the two principal characters.","32":"Maya Vitkova\u2019s eloquent, ambitious, emotionally committed drama Viktoria premiered at Sundance 10 years ago and more than deserves its UK streaming release now. This excellent film would be a striking accomplishment from anyone \u2013 and this was actually Vitkova\u2019s debut. It feels fierce and urgent: tremendously designed, acted and shot. Viktoria is an intergenerational women\u2019s story from Bulgaria both before and after the 1989 revolutions, a film that maybe in its absurdism, scepticism and slow-burn passion shows the influences of Romanian director Radu Jude, with whom Vitkova worked on short films. On TV, Vitkova produced an episode of Michael Palin\u2019s BBC TV New Europe travel series, heading across the Balkans; Viktoria, interestingly, has an image of someone walking across the snow, only to be flicked over by a giant hand from the sky.In Sofia, Bulgaria, in the low-morale 70s, a young woman called Boryana (Irmena Chichikova) is plotting her escape from the dreary Eastern bloc with her doctor husband Ivan (Dimo Dimov); she dreams of the US and has a cigarette lighter in the shape of the Statue of Liberty. Her disloyal views are very much not shared by her glowering mother Dima (Mariana Krumova) who is a diehard communist and cannot conceive of any existence other than submission to the (male) party power structure. When Boryana gets pregnant, she is horrified, and does everything she can to abort the child; she does not have the milk of maternal kindness in her. Milk is to be the film\u2019s keynote image of frustration and discontent \u2013 along with the blood of the yearned-for miscarriage.But her baby girl Viktoria \u2013 whom we first see bobbing around in the womb as an eerie red presence \u2013 is born on Bulgarian Victory day, 9 September, with no umbilical cord or belly button. The party authorities decide that that this baby is symbolic of a bold young country in a permanently revolutionary state of renewal, without the belly button of old loyalties. So Viktoria and her family get special privileges, always under officialdom\u2019s eye, thus permanently ruining Boryana\u2019s chances of a discreet escape. Viktoria grows up to be a pampered, brattish 10-year-old (Daria Vitkova), who is allowed to inspect the belly buttons of fellow pupils at her special school and use a special hotline to phone her adoring godfather, the prime minister. As for Boryana, she is in a catatonic state of resentment: she smiles just once, 50 minutes into the movie, when she thinks she might be about to escape.Then the Berlin Wall falls, and grandmother, mother and daughter are orphaned by the times; the umbilical cord that linked them to their various emotional certainties has vanished. Dima relapses into shock, not unlike her daughter\u2019s silent resentment; Boryana is unsure what to make of the new freedom at home which she has spent her life assuming could only exist abroad. Young Viktoria grows to be a teenager (now played by Kalina Vitkova); all her princessy entitlement has been confiscated but she achieves a new kind of maturity in a closer relationship with her grandmother.The power of Viktoria is in the tragedy of an unused life, unused passion, unfulfilled potential and unrealised existence. For Boryana and her generation, 1989 and the end of communism was a seismic but uninterpretable event; they were not old enough (like Dima) to have known the security of the old communist ways, nor young enough (like Viktoria) fully to enjoy the new freedoms. The film shows that after the Soviet collapse, there is something strange, drifting, almost anticlimactic. Hideous though postwar communism was, it was in some ways a great period, replete with drama and purpose and meaning; now that has gone, and they are left with a blankness, as blank as Viktoria\u2019s belly button-free stomach. There is a sense of loss but of something else too: the possibility of reinvention and a historical slate wiped clean.Viktoria is released on 15 February on Klassiki.","33":"This performance-driven documentary tracks the lengths to which organisers and players went in February 2020 to put together a show featuring mostly female taiko drummers from both Asia and the US. (Taiko are Japanese barrel-shaped drums that come in a range of sizes, from roughly bucket-sized to airplane-engine sized.) Taiko also refers to a whole style of performance that has grown up around ensembles playing together in overlapping or contrapuntal rhythm patterns, sometimes supplemented with singers, dancers and other traditional Japanese instruments. Professional taiko performers are traditionally men \u2013 who perform in relatively little clothing because it\u2019s fierce, sweaty work but perhaps also so that viewers can admire the players\u2019 muscular physiques. Like many traditional Japanese performance styles, women were excluded from it until recently and, inspired by touring companies of taiko drummers, it has taken off in the US, not just among Japanese expats but among wider Asian-American communities.Enter Jennifer Weir, the CEO of TaikoArts Midwest, who is one of the film\u2019s producers and a woman of Korean lineage who was adopted by Americans. Weir and her wife Megan Chao-Smith, who is also a drummer, conceive a plan to put on a showcase featuring some of the best female taiko players they can rustle up, including luminaries such as Chieko Kojima and Kaoly Asano from Japan as well as Sacramento-born Tiffany Tamaribuchi. The film basically tracks them through the ups and downs of bringing the company together, rehearsing despite language difficulties, finding a venue that can accommodate their numbers and putting on a show that acquires the name HERbeat.Once the music finally kicks in, which in the last act is shown in satisfyingly hefty chunks, the magic starts. All the other let\u2019s-put-on-a-show shenanigans that lead up that \u2013 which includes endless shots of people looking stressed and having intense conversations over, say, should they have a few men in the show or keep it women only \u2013 is frankly a bit boring. Directors Dawn Mikkelson and Keri Pickett are not necessarily into asking probing questions, which means some of it feels a little hagiographic. It would have been interesting to learn a bit more about taiko from a musician\u2019s point of view: how do they score the pieces, how does choreography fit into it and so on. Presumably, it would have been harder to sell a documentary that just showed the HERbeat performance in its entirety, but personally that\u2019s what I would have rather watched instead. Finding Her Beat is released on 14 February on digital platforms.","34":"This suspenseful comedy-drama gets a little tricksy, with flashbacks within flashbacks and sudden shifts of tone. But the lead actor Aaron Jakubenko (yet another Australian alumnus of the soap Neighbours, nailing the Kansas accent here) has plenty of charisma \u2013 enough to pull the viewer along for the rocky ride mapped out by the writing-directing sibling team, Ben and Jacob Burghart. The Burghart brothers originally made a short version of the set up here, also called Head Count, which might explain the film\u2019s bitty quality, but as aspiring film-makers they have a certain flair.As the film opens, Jakubenko\u2019s protagonist Kat finds himself in the hands of some ominous-looking tough guys who are holding Kat\u2019s own revolver to his head. An arithmetically minded fellow (we later see him getting busted at a casino for counting cards), Kat starts thinking back intensely to all the times the gun has gone off in the last few days in order to determine if there are any bullets left. Cue the tangled string of flashbacks spanning several years to show how he got into this mess, starting with only a few days earlier when Kat was a prisoner of the Kansas Department of Corrections, working on a chain gang. A fellow prisoner further down the chain begged to be allowed to relieve himself in some nearby bushes but became the first of several to be attacked by a pack of cougars. In the confusion, Kat escaped, albeit with a manacle still on his leg. After this absurdist, black comedy opener what follows is a series of farcical events sprinkled with the threat of violence, dosed out in regular intervals.Various supporting characters weave in and out of the story, including Kat\u2019s brother Hayes (Kyle Dyck) and barkeeper Jo (Melanie Zanetti), for whom Kat holds something of a torch. The Burgharts and their editor, Edward Schroer, use rhyming match-on-edits to create structure, for instance where the empty chambers of a gun echo a wheel of poker chips, or a hand is seen in the same position in two different adjacent shots. That sort of thoughtful level of craft is impressively maintained throughout, from the lighting to the score.Head Count is released on 19 February on digital platforms","35":"Tipsy uncles swaying their arms, adverts for a local cash and carry, a child dozing on her mum\u2019s lap: sold-out arena shows rarely feel intimate, but in Wembley, a masterful Shreya Ghoshal induces communal revelry.Ghoshal is one of India\u2019s most successful contemporary playback singers (the vocalists dubbed over actors in film musicals). Emerging in 2000, then the 16-year-old winner of a TV talent show, her transfixing voice \u2013 capable of being sweet and delicate as well as altogether more formidable \u2013 has become a dominant presence across the country\u2019s film industry, and she now has 29 million Instagram followers.Tonight, she glides around the stage amid pyrotechnics and some surreal backdrops (an incongruous snow globe, for example). Smiling coyly, she quips in Hindi, rousing people to clap and sing along, but also to laugh \u2013 as when she tries wearing sunglasses with her glamorous sari ensemble for some \u201cswag\u201d. And then there\u2019s that voice. It cuts through the air like billowing silk, matched in weightlessness by the bansuri in her nine-person band. \u201cWow \u2026 just wow\u201d, someone mutters a few seats away following a sublime rendition of O Saathi Re that crescendos into a blazing quasi-rock number.Accompanied ably by male vocalist Kinjal Chatterjee, Ghoshal\u2019s setlist is relentless, performing her classics (Barso Re, in tribute to London\u2019s near-constant state of \u201cmonsoon\u201d, gets a particularly enthused reception) as well as newer hits such as Ve Kamleya. She pays homage to greats including Mohammad Rafi, Lata Mangeshkar and Asha Bhosle with an arresting covers medley, before sitting behind the grand piano, playing as the audience tenderly sing ghazals with her.This warmth seems remarkable given the scale of the setting, but Ghoshal says she wants to manifest the homely feeling she used to get at family music gatherings. So while a 20-minute break for people to use the toilets feels jarring to the momentum, it adds to the sense that she wants everyone to enjoy this.By the end of the show, when she\u2019s into glorious Bollywood showstoppers such as Ooh La La and Radha, people are running from their seats to get as close to the stage as they can, dancing with contagious abandon. Ghoshal beams down; it\u2019s been a delight.","36":"Premiering at Sundance 2024 yet assembled as if it were primed for the festival two or three decades earlier, Suncoast is the kind of broad, sunny Searchlight crowd-pleaser that aims to make up for its lack of originality with an abundance of heavily shoveled charm. It\u2019s a strategy that just about works when the stakes are low and soapy but films in this subgenre ultimately demand a full-on assault to the heartstrings and the first-time writer-director Laura Chinn can\u2019t quite muster enough genuine emotion to get us there, her so-so debut working best when investment is at its lowest.It\u2019s a busy patchwork of dynamics we loosely know from Searchlight indies all too well. There\u2019s the coming-of-age narrative of a girl named Doris (played by Thandiwe Newton\u2019s daughter Nico Parker) who is pushing herself out of the shadows at school to become more seen, making friends with the girls who had previously ignored her and flirting with the guy she\u2019d never thought herself good enough for. There\u2019s the family drama that sees her clash with a difficult mother (played by Laura Linney) who spends her time caring for a non-communicative son dying of cancer, letting their relationship suffer in the process. Then there\u2019s the most superfluous element as Doris strikes an unlikely friendship with an eccentric grieving husband (Woody Harrelson) protesting outside the hospice where her brother is being cared for.Loosely based on Chinn\u2019s experiences as a teen growing up in the mid-00s, Suncoast feels influenced less by what it was really like in 2005 and more by the kinds of earnestly made dramedies that were being released at the time. Linney is incapable of a truly bad performance and watching her do her brittle, one rant away from having a heart attack shtick is forever watchable but it\u2019s hard to fully buy her as a working-class Floridian waiting tables, never not seeming like she\u2019s a lost Upper East Sider. Parker is a charming young actor but she\u2019s similarly too refined to sell girl from the wrong side of the tracks who no one has noticed at school. The pair do a decent amount of lifting, Linney especially, but we\u2019re never immersed enough in their world to believe them as anything but actors doing a bit, adding another level of artifice to something that is in need of more reality. Harrelson is in full sleepwalk mode, grouching and quipping like he could be in any one of his films from the last 20 years, and it\u2019s not really his fault, his very inclusion never making any narrative sense other than to help pad out a slight story with a sellable name.None of the threads are able to poke themselves out of the murk of familiarity enough to truly pierce (the high school drama is too unspecific to do anything but amble along) but it\u2019s the mother-daughter conflict that almost gets there. Linney\u2019s struggle \u2013 knowing your child is slowly dying and being unable to let that thought not utterly consume and destroy you \u2013 is often played a little too cartoonishly but it\u2019s also affecting and difficult in moments, as the long march of pre-grief transforms a person into someone who can be unpleasant to be around. It\u2019s this knottier character that ends up feeling the most authentic in a film that can struggle with authenticity.Never quite landing with enough of an impact for it to stick around in our heads after the sun has gone in, Suncoast settles for amiable competency.Suncoast is available on Hulu in the US and Disney+ in the UK on 9 February","37":"The first and perhaps most obvious point to make about Robert Connolly\u2019s sequel to his popular and finely made mystery-thriller The Dry is that it\u2019s not dry at all \u2013 it\u2019s very, very wet. The director, again adapting a bestselling novel by Jane Harper, opens with shots of lush wilderness \u2013 the film is largely based in the Victorian mountain ranges \u2013 and rain-covered leaves.The first time we see Eric Bana, back again as federal police agent Aaron Falk, he\u2019s doing laps in a swimming pool. His fellow agent, Carmen Cooper (Jacqueline McKenzie), is anxious to solve their latest case \u2013 a missing person\u2019s investigation \u2013 as flooding might soon hit the region. It is police informant Alice (The Newsreader\u2019s Anna Torv), who is alone, lost and in deep trouble, particularly when the storm hits.This film drips with pot boiler-ish twists and turns, and is saturated with genre machinations \u2013 engaged, like many mystery scripts, in surprising and one-upping the viewer. But developments in the last act especially \u2013 and there are no spoilers here \u2013 contain some tough pills to swallow, including a resolution to a key plot thread that made me think: \u201cWell, that was rather easy.\u201dNevertheless, there\u2019s quite a bit to appreciate in Force of Nature: The Dry 2, including an elevated tone, strong performances and handsome photography of Victorian landscapes, having been filmed in locations including the Yarra Valley, Otways and Dandenong Ranges.Part of the mystery involves determining just what kind of mystery we\u2019re watching. We know it involves a hiking trip gone horribly wrong, everybody returning except for Alice. The expedition was a team-building exercise organised by Bailey Tenants, a corporation headed by CEO Daniel Bailey, played by Richard Roxburgh. (Not dissimilar here, in his slickness and slipperiness, to his performance in Prosper.)Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningHere\u2019s where things get a bit tangled: Falk and Cooper have been investigating Bailey, and Alice is their whistleblowing informant. Her disappearance may be related to this \u2013 or maybe it has something to do with her being an unpleasant person to work with, which is painfully obvious to the rest of her hiking team: Lauren (Robin McLeavy), Bree (Lucy Ansell), Beth (Sisi Stringer) and Daniel\u2019s wife, Jill (Deborra-Lee Furness).Falk is, naturally, a bit suss on the whole situation, sniffing around for information about anything potentially sinister and soon ascertaining that Alice, Daniel and Jill had an argument. \u201cAfter that everything changed,\u201d says one character, in a line that feels befitting of \u2013 or even engineered for \u2013 the trailer. As does a similar, subsequent line commenting on how one small decision \u201ccan change everything\u201d. It\u2019s moments like these, accompanied by an aggressively used score, where Force of Nature feels like it is nudging towards heavy-headedness.Sign up to Saved for LaterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsafter newsletter promotionWhat does feel totally germane to this world is Bana\u2019s carefully withdrawn performance as Falk, again featuring lots of sombre expressions. The rest of the cast are solid too, including a tetchy and bullish Torv, capturing a different and more varied shade of whistleblower than the usual morally driven informant.Like in the first, non-wet The Dry, Connolly jumps back in time, deploying with co-editors Alexandre de Franceschi and Maria Papoutsis a more circular rhythm this time around. One key strand teases out what happened on the hike, the past bleeding into the present, while another \u2013 visually differentiated by a grainy-looking filter \u2013 returns to Falk\u2019s youth. His history was a big part of The Dry, his investigations into the death of an old friend from his home town drawing to the surface terrible memories and dormant emotions around the unsolved death of a teenage girlfriend.Both films double down on the \u201cThis Time It\u2019s Personal\u201d trope, which, second time around, feels a tad forced. Does every case this guy works on involve skeletons in his closet? Fidelity to the source material comes into play, of course, complicated by differences between mediums: what feels totally ordinary on page can come across as something else on screen. Harper has written a third and final book in the series, which I hope Connolly will also adapt into a film \u2013 with Force of Nature, he has done a decent job in keeping us engaged in Falk\u2019s world.Force of Nature: The Dry 2 is in Australian cinemas from Thursday","38":"As another academic year begins, the sisters at university sorority Sigma Lambda Theta are all a-flutter over rush week (whatever that is) and the election for this year\u2019s sorority president; this is expected to be top mean girl Brianna (Sydney Craven) for the third year in a row. However Emily (Lisa Ambalavanar) longs to be popular too in this world where esteem is measured in social media likes and followers. Reasoning that people love interesting pets, she decides to adopt a three-toed sloth from a dodgy exotic animal importer (Stefan Kapicic) and bring it back to the sorority house. Unfortunately, no one realises until too late that the sloth, whom Emily and the others named Alpha, is a homicidal killing machine who doesn\u2019t move all that slowly when she\u2019s on a mission to slash with those gnarly knitting-needle-long claws. What\u2019s more, Alpha can also drive, use a computer, and take her own selfies. OMG!As the above might suggest, the very premise of this film is fantastically daft \u2013 so silly that one can only imagine that director Matthew Goodhue and writers Bradley Fowler and Cady Lanigan cooked up the idea while bingeing lord knows what infernal substance. Perhaps someone dared them to make a horror film with the most unlikely species they could think of, and after dismissing platypuses (already used in Phineas and Ferb), echidnas (Sonic the Hedgehog), and dwarf lemurs (Madagascar), they settled on sloths.But beyond that one joke set-up and the title itself, Slotherhouse is sadly not that funny, even accounting for the fact that it has such a soft target in the American campus \u201cGreek\u201d system. A few more script drafts might have helped sharpen this into something a little more bitingly satirical, comparable to, say Black Sheep, a cracking little New Zealand comedy-horror film about mutant sheep from quite a few years back. Budget must have been tight, which is why the film is shot mostly in two or three locations in Serbia, and all the American sorority sisters are played by British actors. They, at least, deserve some credit \u2013 especially Ambalavanar, EastEnders veteran Craven and Bianca Beckles-Rose who gets to be the comic relief butch among the femmes \u2013 for screaming with such commitment and managing to keep a straight face throughout. Slotherhouse is released on 12 February on digital platforms.","39":"Film-maker Jeanie Finlay paints a warm and generous portrait of a sympathetic subject: the American fat activist, podcaster and bestselling author Aubrey Gordon who became a viral sensation for her blog Your Fat Friend, in which she railed against the cruelty \u2013 sometimes unintentional and sometimes not \u2013 of people who can\u2019t help deriding people like her. Her sprightly, witty, unrepentant arias of complaint earned her a fanbase that included Roxane Gay, James Corden and Adele. But it also got her trolling and vicious abuse.Gordon tells us of a lifetime enduring cringe-making euphemisms and condescension, as well as taking on the insidious diet industry, which has now rebranded itself the \u201cwellness\u201d industry; she makes a fierce and persuasive case that the diet\/wellness racket is a corporate machine that promotes anxieties and self-hate among women and then converts that into money. She compares big diet to big tobacco \u2013 a boldly dissentient analysis, in fact, given that the cigarette comparison is what many reach for in talking about the processed food industry.The film also talks to Gordon\u2019s parents and, with delicacy and tact, indicates that her mother\u2019s decision to take Gordon to a junior diet class when she was in her early teens did no good at all and may simply have created an unhappiness that contributed to an eating disorder. It also might have been a factor in her parents\u2019 divorce, and again Finlay subtly lets the audience see what might have happened here. Gordon\u2019s dad is a retired pilot \u2013 ironic, considering how awful fat people are made to feel on planes \u2013 and he remarried a flight attendant (or \u201cstewardess\u201d as they were known in those days) who was very much part of the male-pleasing body-shape template. Interestingly, perhaps even slyly, Finlay edits her film so that we hear Gordon complain how the phrase \u201cyou have great skin\u201d is a classic avoidant euphemism \u2013 and then we hear her stepmother sweetly say that exact thing. As for issues around relationships, they are not discussed at all. Perhaps a flaw.Fundamentally, Gordon\u2019s position appears to be that there are some people whose physiology and metabolism are such that they will always be fat, like it or not, and that any struggle on their part to contain it would mean a zombie-like obsession which would obliterate every other aspect of their waking lives. In brief: it isn\u2019t worth it and, as Keynes might have said in this context, in the long run we are all dead, so deal with it. Let fat people be fat and stop victimising them.In a way, this is a libertarian argument that runs against arguments from left and right, saying in the effect that this whole issue is an American first world symptom of prosperity. But the issue of the alleged insensitivity of doctors who raise concerns about heart disease and diabetes could have been addressed more rigorously. Well, the humour and generosity of Gordon shine through. Your Fat Friend is released on 9 February in UK and Irish cinemas","40":"Terrence Malick\u2019s richly achieved early film from 1978 is now rereleased; it is a tragic romance and slo-mo melodrama which appeared five years after his debut, and after which Malick mysteriously vanished from public view until The Thin Red Line came out fully 21 years later to banish his Salingerian reclusive reputation. Days of Heaven reintroduced to movie audiences his passionate sense of landscape, his unhurried tempo and mastery of calm, although this is in fact an eventful and dramatic film. It also established his compositional technique which foregrounds the shifts and eddies of mood; it is partly a function of shooting a great deal, shaping the movie in the edit and cutting a lot out. In years and decades to come, many of his actors would be disconcerted to discover at their movie premiere that their parts had been radically slimmed or junked entirely. And perhaps most importantly, Days of Heaven established Malick\u2019s most recognisable authorial signature: his reverence for the fading, deepening sunlight of dusk which made him virtually the high priest of the \u201cgolden hour\u201d.It is set in 1916, with some of the US feverishly excited about the fortunes still to be made in the vast swathes of still unexploited farmland and also aware of the looming inevitability of getting involved in the European war. Three drifters from Chicago arrive in the Texas panhandle in the north of the state, hoping to get seasonal farm labouring work. Abby (Brooke Adams), is a beautiful, quiet young woman with a kid sister Linda (Linda Manz), an annoying, entertaining chatterbox who is also watchful and slightly scared by how vulnerable they are; she is the film\u2019s deadpan narrator, coolly accepting their hardship and survival stratagems. With them is Abby\u2019s lover, the brooding and hot-tempered Bill (Richard Gere), who has fled the city after killing a factory foreman and is now posing as Abby\u2019s brother.The trio fetch up on a giant estate owned by one of the state\u2019s richest men, a melancholy and refined figure played by Sam Shepard; he notices Abby and takes a diffident, gentlemanly shine to her. Cunning Bill has overheard the man\u2019s doctor telling him he has only a year to live and so encourages Abby to seduce him into marriage, which will make them rich after his imminent death. But to his horror, the Faustian bargain doesn\u2019t pay off: the farmer is revitalised, even cured, by married love, and for her part Abby can see how she could flower with this cultured man and not the brutish Bill, who is tormented by jealousy. And perhaps the Old Testament God that rules over Texas will send a biblical plague to punish this transgression.Malick drew on classic sources to make his own classic: John Steinbeck\u2019s The Grapes of Wrath (with Thomas Hardy at one remove, perhaps) and Andrew Wyeth\u2019s painting Christina\u2019s World. I noticed the resemblance to another American master: Henry James. And, of course, Bill and Abby\u2019s final ordeal has something of Bonnie and Clyde and Butch and Sundance.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotionMalick shows us the abyss of subtle iniquity in the situation that Bill has created for himself. Shepard\u2019s farmer good-naturedly invites Bill and Linda to come live with him and his new wife; he and Abby enjoy their conjugal intimacy, which Abby doesn\u2019t seem to mind too much, but Bill finds that his cynicism and greed have not cushioned him against his agony. And the strange thing about Days of Heaven is that for all their intimacy, Bill and Abby are really like a brother and sister; their imposture, their poverty, their utter dependence on fate and capitalist market forces has infantilised them both. The grownup love relationship, however doomed and founded on deceit it is, is that which Abby has with the innocent farmer. All this is set against a vast backdrop of wheatfields, whose mystery and beauty comes into focus every night as the sun goes down: a premonition of death and the disclosure of meaning which we all hope will arrive just before our lives\u2019 end.As Malick\u2019s film-making career continued, some of the brevity and realist clarity of Days of Heaven would be less apparent, and his work asked audiences to breathe the thinner and more rarefied air of the visionary. But this movie showed his artistry and purpose from the very early days. Days of Heaven is released on 2 February in UK and Irish cinemas, and is available on digital platforms in Australia.","41":"The rectangle of the screen itself seems to bend and twist into a giant self-satisfied smirk for this unbearably smug caper from director Matthew Vaughn. It has all the interest of a men\u2019s magazine cover-shoot: thin, flimsy, lumbered with a dull meta-narrative and dodgy acting, and boasting a blank parade of phoned-in cameos from the supporting cast. Argylle is a high-concept elevator pitch stuck between floors, a piece of colourful would-be franchise content that Vaughn is tiresomely trying to fold into the extended universe of his other work.I have in the past enjoyed this director\u2019s raucous bad taste, and it\u2019s not true to say that he can only direct macho guys because he got such great stuff from Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz in his superhero comedy Kick-Ass. But through some terrible directing anti-alchemy, he has elicited an awful lead performance here from Bryce Dallas Howard as spy novelist Elly Conway, whose creations uncannily mirror real life. She looks waxy, inert and uncomfortable; it\u2019s as if she is wearing cut-glass contact lenses, with a torpid, unfocused quality which the script\u2019s big twist does not explain or excuse. Vaughn and screenwriter Jason Fuchs never give this writer any funny or interesting lines or find a satisfying way to let her character in on the unwieldy joke and bring out her supposed dual quality as action heroine \u2013 although it was, admittedly, ingenious of Vaughn and Fuchs to bring out a novelisation of the film this month supposedly written by \u201cElly Conway\u201d herself.We are shown a super spy called Argylle, a dapper, jaunty Brit stolidly played by Henry Cavill with a silly square haircut and some sort of goofy velveteen jacket, in a safe pair of manicured hands performance. He confronts LaGrange, a slinky femme-fatale killer played by Dua Lipa, and teams up with his comrades Wyatt (John Cena) and Keira (Ariana DeBose). But we are also shown the more down to earth life of Conway, a bestselling spy writer, taking adoring questions from her fanbase at sold-out bookstore readings, putting the finishing touches to the latest novel in her \u201cArgylle\u201d series and testily taking notes about the ending in a Zoom call with her adoring mother, Ruth, played by Catherine O\u2019Hara.But just as she is making a train journey to see her mom, a wild-haired grinning guy called Aidan (Sam Rockwell) plonks down in the empty seat opposite. He professes himself to be her biggest fan, explaining that he is a professional spy and that a number of important and scary people in his world are taking an interest in the extraordinary way she is able to predict exactly what they are getting up to. These people include a certain Mr Ritter (Bryan Cranston), who runs a renegade evil-empire setup called \u201cThe Division\u201d.This could theoretically be a fun movie, but it is all so self-conscious and self-admiring, with key action sequences rendered null and void by being played on two levels, the imaginary and the real, so cancelling each other out. The thought of Argylle 2 and Argylle 3 is very dispiriting. The books might do better. Argylle is released on 1 February in Australia and on 2 February in the UK and the US.","42":"You could do worse at half-term than this new family animation from Illumination (the studio behind Sing and Minions). It\u2019s a zany caper about a family of mallards; it\u2019s not particularly original, with ideas and laughs that feel a little dusty, like they\u2019ve been cobbled from bits and bobs knocking around the studio. But there are enough high jinks \u2013 as well as a seriously cute duckling \u2013 to keep it on the flight path.In New England, a daddy duck called Mack (voiced by Kumail Nanjiani) is risk-averse and overprotective of his two kids: teenager Dax (Caspar Jennings) and that adorable duckling, Gwen (Tresi Gazal). Somehow, the kids twist Mack\u2019s wing into migrating south for the first time, and what follows is a series of scrapes as the family fly to Jamaica. After a wrong turn they crash-land in New York, where the animators go to town on a gaggle of realistic-looking pigeons whose aggro leader has an unsightly rotted-off foot and is brilliantly voiced by Awkwafina with a Noo Yoik hoodlum accent.The script is co-written by Mike White, creator of The White Lotus; White is vegan, apparently, so naturally much of the jeopardy revolves around the ducks being at risk of ending up on someone\u2019s plate. There\u2019s a disappointingly bland personality-lite non-speaking villain called Chef, owner of a Manhattan restaurant, who looks creepily like Bono beefed up to the size of the Rock, with a goatee and tiny tinted glasses. More fun is the duck farm run by two boomer hippies, where the duck in charge is a shaman dude voiced by Peep Show\u2019s David Mitchell.All of which make for a perfectly acceptable family animation. But Migration does feels like B-team Illumination, and time will tell if it has any franchise potential. I can\u2019t imagine kids watching this nine times over like Sing. That said, my two seven-year-old cinema buddies giggled themselves senseless on the bus home repeating a line about the mallards getting turned into duck a l\u2019orange. So what do I know? Migration is released on 2 February in UK and Irish cinemas","43":"Thelonious \u201cMonk\u201d Ellison is a middle-aged black humanities professor in Los Angeles, roundly disliked by students and faculty colleagues, who is the author of many intellectually demanding and commercially disastrous novels based on classical myth. Depressed by his career and by money worries \u2013 including an elderly mother needing residential care for dementia \u2013 Monk is finally triggered by the bestselling triumph of a new novel by black author Sintara Golden, entitled We\u2019s Lives in da Ghetto, which apparently panders to all the illiterate black-victimhood cliches beloved of white cultural gatekeepers. Enraged, Monk writes a spoof hood-violence novel, My Pafology, by the supposed convicted felon Stagg R Leigh, and sends it to his agent, assuming the obvious crassness will signal its satirical intent. But then \u2026 well, those acquainted with the Broadway career of Max Bialystock and Leo Bloom might guess what happens next.American Fiction is the highly entertaining new literary comedy from film-maker Cord Jefferson, a TV writer making his feature directing debut with his own emollient adaptation of the metafictional masterpiece Erasure by Percival Everett, published in 2001. Jeffrey Wright is an excellent Monk: sensitive, morose, prickly and idealistic in a gloomily self-harming way. Tracee Ross Ellis is his shrewd physician sister Lisa; Sterling K Brown is his cosmetic surgeon brother Cliff, who has just come out as gay; Leslie Uggams is affectingly dignified as Monk\u2019s mother Agnes; Issa Rae is Monk\u2019s nemesis, Sintara Golden. It all works very enjoyably, despite Jefferson sugaring the original a little, including changing the specific kind of medical practice that Lisa has.American Fiction succeeds in spite of arguably flunking a particular challenge, faced up to more candidly by Michael Winterbottom and Frank Cottrell-Boyce with their adaptation of Laurence Sterne\u2019s Tristram Shandy in A Cock and Bull Story from 2006, or Harold Pinter with his screenplay version of John Fowles\u2019s The French Lieutenant\u2019s Woman in 1981, adaptations which explicitly attempted to reproduce in realist movie terms the originals\u2019 meta-levels of narrative. This is because the midsection of Everett\u2019s original novel includes the text of My Pafology in its entirety; it is long enough for readers to immerse themselves in it, to register how absurd and exaggerated it is but also see its thrilling gusto and energy and maybe even, who knows, wonder if the author perhaps toyed with the idea of attempting a bestseller like this himself but settled for presenting it in quotation marks.So in transposing this to film, Jefferson must surely have pondered the possibility of making his Monk a highbrow film studies professor whose My Pafology is not a novel but a screenplay for something like New Jack City (which is referenced here). Well, Jefferson engages with these ideas at the end, and it is an amusing and absorbing fantasy of how class and race and literary taste collide, and a parable of career defeat ironically redeemed by society\u2019s hypocrisy and absurdity. It is also a mordant study of literary envy: Monk\u2019s angry imitation of We\u2019s Lives in da Ghetto reminded me a little of Kingsley Amis\u2019s description in his memoirs of being rattled by the superior success of a despised rival, and his fleeting fear that he should simply swallow his pride and imitate this person\u2019s style.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotionAt one point Jefferson invents a confrontation between Monk and Sintara in which Sintara stands up for her novel, and this is perhaps a loss of satirical nerve (the author\u2019s name is incidentally more obviously parodic in the book). Wright and Rae play the scene with conviction, however, and make us see a kind of snobbery in Monk\u2019s reaction to her success, and maybe something gendered too. Then there is something a bit farcical when Monk has to pose in public as the slouching imaginary badass Stagg R Leigh \u2013 but perhaps no more farcical than the real-life case of the author Laura Albert, exposed in 2006 for inventing phoney abuse survivor JT LeRoy, who had written thrillingly authentic fictions about her supposedly troubled life, and got her sister-in-law to put on a wig and sunglasses to be this reclusive literary genius. (Erasure in fact predates this case.)Broad-brush American Fiction might be, but its approach to race and racism is oblique and unexpected, and it\u2019s very funny about publishing\u2019s literary ghetto. American Fiction is released on 2 February in UK and Irish cinemas, and will be streaming on Prime Video in Australia from 27 February.","44":"There are certain stories that seem to be fundamentally ill-suited for reinvention as a musical, and Alice Walker\u2019s The Color Purple, with its themes of incestuous rape, spousal abuse, racism, inequality and poverty, is arguably one such story. And yet here we are. After the multi-Oscar-nominated 1985 adaptation directed by Steven Spielberg and a Broadway musical version, Walker\u2019s epic novel returns to the big screen, in this incarnation a tonally jarring song and dance spectacle, directed by Blitz Bazawule (co-director of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Black Is King).This decades-spanning story of an embattled Black woman\u2019s struggle to find her inner strength has lost none of its ability to shock. When we first meet Celie (played by Phylicia Pearl Mpasi as a child and the impressive Fantasia Barrino as an adult), she is a 14-year-old, heavily pregnant for the second time by her monstrous bully of a father (Deon Cole), a father who later barters her into marriage to the violently abusive and serially unfaithful Mister (Colman Domingo). Mister breaks his wife\u2019s spirit and denies her contact with her beloved sister Nettie (played by Halle Bailey as a child). Meanwhile, spirited Sofia (Danielle Brooks), the sometime wife of Mister\u2019s son, is imprisoned for six years for punching a white man.It\u2019s a punishingly bleak story, and the songs, with their antiseptic polished sheen, seem fundamentally out of tune with the unforgiving grit of the plot. Likewise, the look of the film: there\u2019s a gauzy, honey-dipped nostalgic glow to the photography that romanticises Celie\u2019s grim existence, softening the hard edges and prettifying the misery. While I love a life-affirming tale of redemption as much as the next person, there\u2019s something synthetic and disingenuous about this one.","45":"When laconic rapper-turned-actor Snoop Dogg is called on to appear in a film, he more often than not plays himself or a version thereof \u2013 and so it goes again in this salty but ultimately very wholesome sports movie. There\u2019s even a sly parallel between the character Snoop plays and the efforts he\u2019s made in the real world setting up an American football league for kids. Yes, his thespian range may be pretty limited, but there\u2019s no denying Snoop has a palpable onscreen charisma and a good sense of comic timing that director Charles Stone III skilfully directs around.The plot, as old as time \u2013 or at least as old as vintage 1976 comedy The Bad New Bears \u2013 posits Snoop as JJ, a once-feted professional football player best known for his mildly disappointing career despite early promise and lack of loyalty to anyone one team. Struggling to make a comeback as a commentator, JJ hits rock bottom when his reckless driving causes an accident and a judge he knew from the old days sentences him to 30 days of community service, picking up dog poop in a city park in Long Beach, California. There, JJ notices Cerise (Tika Sumpter), an ex-girlfriend from high school who is now a hard-working single mom trying to support her pre-pubescent son Tre (Jonigan Booth, a find) while he plays ball with a team that is, of course, bottom of the league. Before you can remember how to spell Walter Matthau, JJ has signed on to coach the team, aiming to turn these \u201cUnderdoggs\u201d into a viral success story he can hype on his own podcast and thus parlay into better career prospects for himself.Lo and behold, the subsequent events pan out pretty much as one would expect, but there are few admirable plays that upend expectations. The young cast, given license to swear like navvies are clearly having a blast, and it\u2019s nice to see the general sausage fest broken up with a young female character (Kyla Davila) who plays a crucial role in the team\u2019s eventual success. Comedian Andrew Schultz is another bright spot as JJ\u2019s nemesis, the coach for the Underdoggs\u2019 biggest rivals. Given how different his character\u2019s humour is, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he improvised most of his material, like the bit where he gets the team to thank God for the invention of plastic helmets hard enough to give rival players brain damage. The Underdoggs is available now on Prime Video.","46":"It\u2019s been 15 years since the sweet, shaggy slacker romcom Adventureland played at the Sundance film festival \u2013 and if that may seem a mere blink of an eye to the small but ardent cult of millennial filmgoers who took the film intensely to heart, its two stars returned earlier this month to the snowy mountains of Utah to remind everyone just how long it\u2019s been. With four films premiering between them, actors Kristen Stewart and Jesse Eisenberg were separately the talk of this year\u2019s festival: at the opening ceremony he presented her, at the grand old age of 33, with the festival\u2019s career-achievement Visionary award.If it seems a bit premature to be handing gold watch prizes to Stewart, she made some sense of the award\u2019s name by heading up the most gobsmacking vision of the Sundance lineup. The much-anticipated second feature from British writer-director Rose Glass, Love Lies Bleeding is a big, bruising, red-meat fever dream of a film, awash in the lurid 80s Americana of mullets and muscle trucks.It stars Stewart and bodybuilder turned actor Katy O\u2019Brian as small-town loners who find love in the most hopeless of places \u2013 a beefcake gym in the New Mexico desert \u2013 and seek a violent escape from the various vile men trying to hold them down, chief among them a beetle-eating Ed Harris, rocking a repulsive Afghan hound coif. Equal parts Titane and Thelma & Louise, it\u2019s as luridly, excitingly untamed as Glass\u2019s debut, Saint Maud, was tightly wound, and gifts Stewart with a role where she can finally own her out-and-proud, don\u2019t-give-a-fuck queerness.It made Stewart\u2019s other film of the festival look rather wan by comparison: the fussily conceived AI romance Love Me pairs her with Steven Yeun as two android life forms who meet and bond several billion years into the post-human future, only to find avatars for their relationship in the excavated videos of a picture-perfect Instagram influencer couple. It\u2019s all an unnecessarily cosmic setup for a tired critique of social media superficiality; its stars deserve better, and in Glass\u2019s film, Stewart at least got it.Eisenberg, for his part, turned up in another of the festival\u2019s most bizarre big swings, though quite unrecognisably so. In Sasquatch Sunset, an absurdist meditation from fraternal auteurs Nathan and David Zellner, he and Riley Keough appear in vastly hairy full-body prosthetics as members of a Bigfoot family in the idyllic wilds of California. Light on story and devoid of dialogue, it imagines the everyday Sasquatch routine with a mixture of Malickian magic-hour serenity and visceral bodily function detail.The result is unexpectedly touching for something so heavy on primate fart gags \u2013 but Eisenberg served himself better in his own directorial effort, the winningly tragicomic road movie A Real Pain, in which he and Succession\u2019s Kieran Culkin star as estranged Jewish cousins tracing their ancestral roots on a Holocaust tour of Poland. It\u2019s a loose premise for an emotionally cutting, mordantly funny examination of faith, family and that peculiarly American conception of sacred European heritage. As a study of Jewish identity in crisis, it made a fine Sundance double bill with director Nathan Silver\u2019s hugely endearing farce Between the Temples, starring a wonderful Jason Schwartzman as a flailing synagogue cantor coaching a septuagenarian music teacher (Carol Kane, never kookier but also tenderly human) as she prepares for a late-life bat mitzvah.A Real Pain sold during the festival to Searchlight Pictures, Disney\u2019s indie arm, for $10m, a notable coup at a Sundance where the deal-making side of things was quieter than usual. The biggest buy of the festival came from Netflix, which paid $17m for It\u2019s What\u2019s Inside \u2013 a nasty, conceptually clever horror film from first-time director Greg Jardin, which arrived with little advance hype, and for which critics were told by anxious PRs that even its very premise must remain embargoed. Yet the sale came with a simultaneous announcement that the film would be skipping cinemas and released directly to the platform. As cheerily as the festival proclaimed the virtues of the communal big-screen experience at every screening, dark signs were rife for the future of theatrical releasing.My favourite film of Sundance this year was certainly enhanced by the collective gasps of a captive, unprepared audience. Aaron Schimberg\u2019s ingenious satire A Different Man, which will also play in competition at Berlin next month, stars a never-better Sebastian Stan as a shy, isolated New Yorker living with facial neurofibromatosis \u2013 until experimental treatment offers him a miracle cure. Yet with his new, conventionally handsome mug, he finds that he\u2019s still the same unwanted outsider as before \u2013 a cruelty underlined when a charming Brit with his former condition (hilariously played by Adam Pearson, the facially different actor first seen in Jonathan Glazer\u2019s Under the Skin) enters his life and proceeds to steal it bit by bit. It\u2019s a wickedly caustic, increasingly surreal reflection on that current hot potato of onscreen representation and ableism, without a hint of sanctimony or self-importance.But the best performance of the festival, finally, came in something rather more conventional. Nora Fingscheidt\u2019s BBC Film-produced The Outrun may seem a familiar addiction-and-recovery drama, but it\u2019s lifted by the novel beauty of its Orkney setting, and given raw grace by a sensational Saoirse Ronan, fully graduating to adult roles as an alcoholic isolating and self-healing with volatile results. At a Sundance heavy on wild provocations, it was proof that traditional indie grit still has its rewards.","47":"It\u2019s easy to roll one\u2019s eyes at nostalgia, so often is fondness for the past used to cover a lack of anything to say. The market is flush with reboots, redos, reunions and the Eras tour, content mining our natural affinity for (and thus, the bankability of) things that shaped us.What a joy, then, that this year\u2019s Sundance film festival featured not one but several films that accomplished the rare and difficult task of employing nostalgia without feeling cheap, that pulled us backwards to sharp, smart, devastating and illuminating effect. Megan Park\u2019s My Old Ass conjured the excitement and overwhelm of leaving home via a bittersweet, mushroom-induced meeting between an 18-year-old girl and her 39-year-old self. Jane Schoenbrun\u2019s buzzy, word-of-mouth hit I Saw the TV Glow resurrected the thrill of analog TV fandom via its own Buffy the Vampire Slayer-esque TV show, for a haunting tale of obsession, identity and fandom. Both film-makers understood that when done well, there are few things more powerful in art than our feelings around the passage of time.So too in D\u00ecdi, Sean Wang\u2019s semi-autobiographical portrait of an Asian American boy in 2008 that is easily one of the best, most seamless films I\u2019ve seen on the experience of growing up online. D\u00ecdi has a clear antecedent in fellow Sundance alum Eighth Grade, Bo Burnham\u2019s 2018 film about a girl\u2019s phone-inflected adolescence that is still the gold standard for affecting films about the internet. The tones are strikingly similar \u2013 understated and natural, sweet and bitingly sour, observing the ordinary thrills and horrors of growing up. Both braid the digital lives of their protagonists with striking accuracy \u2013 Facebook photo albums and comments, Snapchat stories and Instagram faces, overlaid with longing, loneliness and occasional fun.D\u00ecdi is the childhood nickname for Chris Wang (Izaac Wang), a Taiwanese American kid in Fremont, California, stranded in between middle and high school. He\u2019s adrift in his family \u2013 his mostly absent father is away on business in Taiwan; his strained mother (Joan Chen) stuck in a thankless role as stay-at-home mom and caretaker to her judgmental mother-in-law (Chang Li Hua). His sharp-tongued sister, Vivian (Shirley Chen), weeks away from her freshman year of college at UCSD, is four years apart but a world away in his understanding.Chris is a very familiar type of lost between friends, crushes and embarrassments, hampered by a nascent sense of shame at his own difference. His eighth-grade friends believably communicate via janky YouTube videos, slang and slurs pushing the boundaries of what they can get away with. Wang is spot-on specific with the adolescent parlance of time \u2013 the casual homophobic slur, \u201cthat\u2019s gangstaaaa (:\u201d on a Facebook wall, plenty of jokes about race. Chris\u2019s friends are a diverse bunch, but all make comments on his race, well-meaning or otherwise. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty cute, for an Asian,\u201d says his crush, Madi (Mahaela Park), in one of the film\u2019s most quietly devastating scenes. As Chris, Izaac Wang is remarkably naturalistic and heart-piercingly vulnerable \u2013 you know that line will sting for a long, long time.D\u00ecdi is peppered with the easy period signifiers \u2013 a Motorola Krzr flip phone, the movie Superbad, Paramore \u2013 and also the more specific, tricky details that are hard to nail but, when done with as much curiosity and research as here, mesmerizing. I\u2019m admittedly the target age for this, having also spent the summer of 2008 languishing between middle school and high school, nervously checking AIM and pretending to like the Mandy Moore weepie A Walk to Remember to fit in. If Chris\u2019s initial, formative years on the internet map on to yours, then the effect of Wang\u2019s dabbling in desktop cinema is triggering, in the literal sense of memory boxes unlocking; the shock of familiarity that is the Microsoft XP pipes screensaver, Myspace top friends and \u201csummer 08 xD\u201d Facebook photo albums is arresting, these throwaway things that yet once consumed so much emotional energy.D\u00ecdi has a deft handle on the era-nonspecific teenage angst and turmoil as well, enough that one needn\u2019t to be from the class of 2012 to relate to how Chris\u2019s world opens up, via filming videos for a group of older teens, and crumbles around feelings of shame, inadequacy and the devastation that is being left out. The costumes, setting, computer interfaces and music are all scarily accurate to 2008, a testament to Wang\u2019s airtight hold on this particular strange, liminal period \u2013 not just between childhood and adolescence, but between early YouTube and smartphones, Myspace and social media dominance. But its tender blend of emotions is evergreen. D\u00ecdi\u2019s final touching, soft note of growth \u2013 so much internalized and overcome already, so much to go \u2013 would be moving in any year.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotionD\u00ecdi is showing at the Sundance film festival and is seeking distribution","48":"On an unnamed island in the Caribbean, a cartel boss named Manuel (Edoardo Costa) kills bartender Akeem (Tristan Duncan) merely because he spills a drink on Nora (Cami Storm), a young singer Manuel was planning to lock up in his villa and force to sing only for himself, like a canary. The murder is not only grisly and bad management practice, but also consequential because it brings down the wrath of Akeem\u2019s brother Mark (action movie star Michael Jai White, from Mortal Kombat and Black Dynamite), an LA policeman. It turns out Mark grew up on the island where he left behind an ex-wife, Akilah (Gillian White, who is married to her co-star Michael in real life), his mother and lots of old friends. Swearing to find out how Akeem really died, he moves back and a series of fisticuff face-offs ensue as he works through the chain of command, eventually finding his way to Manuel.Directed ploddingly by Shaun Paul Piccinino, a sometime actor himself with a background in stunts, this isn\u2019t going to win any awards, but it has a certain charm as grindhouse schlock. Michael Jai White has a stately gravitas and he\u2019s clearly doing most of his own stunts, which also goes for Gillian White, whose character here runs a martial arts dojo for kids. The chemistry between them is entirely convincing and enough to get viewers rooting for them both to survive so they can get back together.Judging by the end credits, the location seems to have been in and around St Kitts and Nevis but presumably the tiny two-island nation didn\u2019t want to scare off potential tourists. Even so it\u2019s as if this film was made specifically by and for middle-aged and older West Indians who value manners, chivalry and community. All those values are elevated in the final act when, after a rousing speech in a church from Mark, the whole island comes out to help Mark, Akilah and Mark\u2019s smartass police buddy Phil to take down the cartel boss and his gang. Bless! The Island is released on 29 January on digital platforms.","49":"For the majority of film-makers, the restrictions insisted by Covid became a stifling force and created a clear dividing line between those who could flourish in extremely prohibitive circumstances and those who could not. Steven Soderbergh, a director who has never allowed anything \u2013 from Oscar glory to blockbuster success \u2013 to kill his plucky spirit of invention, made one of the only essential pandemic movies with the maddeningly underseen thriller Kimi, a sleek and canny new-tech upgrade of a paranoid 70s thriller. He found a way, along with the screenwriter David Koepp, to maximise limitations and the two have smartly reunited for a project that carries on-paper similarities.Presence, a project shrouded in trademark mystery, shot over last summer with a waiver and now unveiling at Sundance, is another one-location genre exercise, playfully riffing on age-old tropes and allowing Soderbergh, as both director and cinematographer, the opportunity to experiment. This time he\u2019s playing with the conventions of haunted house horror, his film told from the perspective of the ghost situated in a recently renovated house, new inhabitants moving in \u2013 a family, led by Lucy Liu and the This is Us actor Chris Sullivan with the newcomers Callina Liang and Eddy Maday as their teenage children. Like families often do in this genre, they\u2019re arriving with excess baggage, tensions they hope will dissipate in a new home, a fresh start after a period of unease.Soderbergh shoots a series of unbroken sequences as the presence witnesses the family fraying \u2013 a daughter grieving the loss of a friend, a mother prioritising her son as favourite, a father concerned about a potential legal battle \u2013 and we\u2019re left to decipher what it all might mean and where we might be going. For a while, the experiment really works, questions over who the spirit might be remaining unanswered along with its intentions, clarification over what genre we\u2019re even in remaining fascinatingly murky. Gliding around the house, Soderbergh has fun finding ways to involve us in the story, snippets and observations building up an unusual image of a family in trouble, from the micro to the macro, and some bold touches of music suggest that we\u2019re going somewhere emotionally grand. But intrigue starts to waver as the picture, and genre, gets clearer.The more we get to know the family, the harder it becomes to believe their dynamic, Koepp\u2019s vision of division a little too heavy-handed; mother and son emerging as cartoonishly awful counterparts to the saintliness of father and daughter. The more relatable passive-aggression starts to get nastier but the powder keg fizzles rather than ignites and when a more conventional thriller plot comes into play, it\u2019s equally hard to buy, the delicately dropped crumbs of mystery leading us to a surprisingly rote reveal. It\u2019s half-hearted when it should be full-throated and by the end, it\u2019s only the visual gimmick that separates this from standard genre fare.As an experiment, it remains of interest, something to be filed away as a curious technical exercise, and Soderbergh operating at a lower level is still higher than many of his peers. Presence just never fully comes together in the way we hope, a ghost story haunted more by the possibility of what it could have been.Presence is showing at the Sundance film festival and is seeking distribution","50":"Diana Quick makes a return to the big screen \u2013 after a six-year break \u2013 with a first-rate performance in a second-rate (perhaps third-rate) film. Forever Young is a ploddingly drab British sci-fi drama that really doesn\u2019t have what it takes to keep up with Quick; she stars as a 70-year-old writer taking an unlicensed drug to reverse the ageing process. It\u2019s impossible to take your eyes off her: intellectually engaged and emotionally transparent. It\u2019s a pity then that the script is unserious and uninteresting, with nothing to say either about the existential leap in the dark of eternal youth or the ethics of the anti-ageing industry.Quick is Robyn, a bestselling author who\u2019s been happily married to Oscar (Bernard Hill) for donkey\u2019s years. Robyn\u2019s big regret is her decision not to have kids. Then, one day, she gets a shock opening the door to an old flame, Jim, who miraculously looks 40 younger. Jim is a scientist who has invented an anti-ageing drug; now he wants Robyn to take it. She agrees, but husband Oscar refuses. At which point Quick exits, replaced by Amy Tyger as her younger self, and (no offence to Tyger) the movie gets very slack.You have to put up with implausibilities and plot-holes by the shovel load. Robyn takes the age-reversing drug because she wants to have a baby \u2013 but doesn\u2019t appear to ask a single question about the possible side effects. There\u2019s also a painfully unconvincing subplot involving Jim\u2019s daughter, an aggro drug addict and sex worker. In the end, this is a shallow drama passing itself off as saying something meaningful. It left me empty and the only question I was asking by the end is, can someone please write a stunning lead role worthy of Diana Quick? Forever Young is released on 26 January in UK cinemas.","51":"There\u2019s an eccentric Englishness in this quirky, microbudget feature from screenwriter Adam Ganz and director Marc Isaacs. They have created a kind of docu-fictional guided reality, a weird soap set in the picturesque Essex town of Thaxted, known for its association with the composer Gustav Holst who was entranced by its beauty and established a music festival there with the encouragement of its Christian socialist vicar, Conrad Noel.Ganz and Isaacs have got some present-day Thaxted inhabitants to play heightened or fictionally modified versions of themselves, in a story interspersed with black-and-white clips from Ripe Earth, the Boulting brothers\u2019 early short film from 1938, also set in Thaxted. Lori (Yingge Lori Yang) is a young Chinese film-maker who has come to Thaxted to record the local traditions, especially the morris dancing, but finds herself drawn into the world of Keith (Keith Martin), a fierce Arsenal fan, devastated by the recent loss of his wife, who looked after his financial affairs, but may not have been faithful to him. Conrad Noel\u2019s ghostly voice speaks to Lori, explaining how socialism grows naturally from the teachings of Christ, and she is also visited by the ghost of Keith\u2019s late wife who is tormented by her need to confess from beyond the grave.As for Thaxted itself, it isn\u2019t exactly the Shakespearean \u201cdemi-paradise\u201d declaimed by Keith. There is what looks like a nasty altercation in the pub, occasioned by Lori\u2019s presence, and Isaacs allows us to glimpse what looks like someone in minstrel blackface in an old photograph of a morris dancing scene. There are, however, no mentions of Brexit. An odd, but diverting modern pastoral scene, which refuses a parochial view of England. This Blessed Plot is released on 26 January in UK cinemas.","52":"At Sundance, a festival geared towards acquisition with unsold films going for the hard sell, there\u2019s something intriguing about those that withhold. While for mysterious romance Love Me, the involvement of the Oscar nominees Kristen Stewart and Steven Yeun was enough by itself to vault the film to the top of many wishlists, its logline was less of a sure thing. A post-apocalyptic love story between a buoy and a satellite was something that people would have to see to understand and so there was an unusual sense of curious excitement in the air at its packed-out premiere, no one quite sure what was about to be experienced.But while the curiosity might have sustained itself for the most part, the excitement slowly faded, the film an alluring but ultimately failed experiment. Rather than giving us something we truly haven\u2019t seen before, it falls too closely in line with other recent films that have felt less like standalone acts of original creation and more like discarded Black Mirror episodes. While not quite as deadening as Foe or Fingertips, it leaves us with a similar sense of frustration, the not particularly gratifying act of witnessing an idea being workshopped in real time, happier with itself than we are watching it.It starts with a bold, and bleak, look into the future. Humanity is long gone and a digitally assisted smart buoy (voiced by Stewart) is all alone. One day, it encounters a satellite (voiced by Yeun), charged with explaining the end of the world to any life form it might encounter. Their fractured communication starts to evolve into something more human as they develop a sense of what it is to be alive via shreds of a long-expired internet. As they get closer, they start to change form, modelled after two vacuous influencers, playing at being in love before starting to question what real love is.The first-time film-makers Sam and Andy Zuchero have certainly not picked the easy route with their debut, spanning billions of years and combining animation, live-action and some stunning, expansive visuals. But ambition only takes the film so far, a big swing aiming to comment on and cover so much, too much, that it deserves only admiration for trying rather than applause for succeeding. The initial scenes, which bring to mind the opening stretch of Wall-E, are the most endearing, as the two objects try to work out a way to communicate and define themselves. The swerve that follows, as the film turns the pair into animated avatars of the influencers that one of then covets, has its moments, with the pair stuck in an endless cycle of making Blue Apron spon-con trying to break out of the formula into something authentic. But the film\u2019s grasp of the internet and its jabs at social media feel too broad and far too dated, repeatedly hammering easy targets into nothing.The Zucheros flit between almost compelling quandaries about the trap of idealised straight romance and the hell of expected performance within it to more rote and repetitive observations about gender. It\u2019s all strangely stacked against its female character, who is painted as an irrational, deceitful nag, while its male lead is merely trying to find himself outside of the dynamic she has forced on to them. A more entertaining film might have turned this into a thriller but with its loudly beating heart on its sleeve, Love Me wants to be a sweeping romance instead, insisting us to reach emotional heights that the film just can\u2019t take us to (a score that intercuts between lush Michael Giacchino-esque highs and intrusively annoying jazzy lows doesn\u2019t help matters). It feels like a short that was expanded without enough thought for how it might work as a whole movie and by the end, even that curiosity has faded too.Like Stewart, Yeun has worked hard to distance himself from the limits of the genre franchise that made him, taking left-field turns when offered, picking actor over movie star, and this marks another interestingly offbeat choice for them both. They do what they can with their multiple personas but there\u2019s forever a disconnect with what we\u2019re being told and how we\u2019re then made to feel, in a film wanting desperately to be loved that makes it near impossible.Love Me is screening at the Sundance film festival and is seeking distribution","53":"More often than not, the opening night slot at Sundance has become more curse than blessing, too many films living and dying in just one night, barely to be seen again. Emilia Clarke and Chiwetel Ejiofor\u2019s sci-fi comedy The Pod Generation anyone? How about the Michelle Williams and Julianne Moore melodrama After the Wedding? Daisy Ridley\u2019s suicide drama Sometimes I Think About Dying? Or maybe that sequel to An Inconvenient Truth that you didn\u2019t even know existed? This year\u2019s sacrificial lamb, the 80s-set anthology Freaky Tales, is nothing if not confident in its ability to make an impact, asserting itself as an experience that won\u2019t easily be forgotten.Acting as its own hype man, the film begins with a block of narrated opening text positioning what we\u2019re about to see as a \u201chella wild\u201d ride, a promise that had already been made during its introduction, excitably sold to us as something that would make certain audience members\u2019 heads explode. But while the film\u2019s makers \u2013 the writer-director duo Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck \u2013 might seem to think that they\u2019ve made a new cult classic, it\u2019s hard to share in their bullish enthusiasm, eye-rolling fatigue meeting their insistence that this is something to be quoted, rewatched and adored. For as bold as Boden and Fleck seem to think Freaky Tales is, it\u2019s a hodgepodge of things we\u2019ve seen done before and done better, a sub-Tarantino fanboy assembly of vaguely interconnected stories that belongs less in the 80s and more in the mid-to-late 90s when every American indie wannabe was trying to emulate their new icon.We\u2019re taken back to 1987, dropped into a vibrant but tense Oakland, California, and told about a glowing green substance that has an unusual effect on those who encounter it. There are punks taking on Nazis (led by Scream 7\u2019s Jack Champion and the Expats newcomer Ji-young Yoo), a pair of female rappers taking on a rap battle (an acting debut for Normani alongside Wakanda Forever\u2019s Dominique Thorne, a standout), a debt-collecting killer for hire taking on his bosses (the man of the moment Pedro Pascal and Ben Mendelsohn, regrettably going full ham) and an NBA star taking on the criminals who have targeted his life (the Insecure star Jay Ellis). The stories are presented as separate, titled tales but often intertwine, connective tissue being the theme of the underdog. But what should be easy catharsis \u2013 skinheads, racists, misogynists, homophobes and killers all being avenged, often violently \u2013 is made hard by Boden and Fleck\u2019s inability to give us a rousing win. The battles that take place, whether they\u2019re fought by words or action, are all flubbed; rushed and poorly developed involving characters we know little of doing something we don\u2019t really care about. Cheers replaced by shrugs.Boden and Fleck came to Sundance in 2006 with the punchy and persuasive Ryan Gosling drama Half Nelson but have had a strange, off-key career since. There have been highs \u2013 the sensitive baseball story Sugar \u2013 but more recently lows \u2013 the point and shoot anonymity of Captain Marvel. On paper, Freaky Tales seems like a response to the thankless grunt work of operating within the MCU and it\u2019s clearly a film that has personal resonance for the pair but it becomes the most alienating type of one-for-us project, a self-indulgent home movie somehow made for the big screen. Their nostalgia for the era is shown to us in a string of lists, naming 80s films for the sake of naming 80s films, at its worst in an embarrassing video store scene involving a bizarre A-list cameo running through the best underdog movies of all time. The same can be said of the music, needle-drop upon needle-drop, encouraging the kind of point-at-the-screen \u201cI know that too\u201d nostalgia that has consumed so much of pop culture, as if the mere act of recognition is enough.The plotting is sloppy but somehow smug, a mystery box put together by people too focused on the wrapping to care about what\u2019s inside (a double-bill with Saltburn awaits!). There\u2019s an over-reliance on pointless visual gimmicks, (did we need an animated baseball sequence or an aspect ratio change or two characters\u2019 inner thoughts represented as doodles?) but the film is otherwise sleekly made and post-Marvel, shows the pair to have developed as strong commercial film-makers. The final gory setpiece is effectively choreographed if a little too pastiche-y to stick, yet like so much of the film, seems as if it were based on a graphic novel, making the film a strange and ungainly companion piece to Captain Marvel. Is it their attempt to have the fun they wanted from that project but on their own terms? Maybe. But for a film so clearly designed to be fun above all else, it ends up being a bizarre slog. I\u2019m glad they enjoyed themselves so much, shame we couldn\u2019t join in.Freaky Tales is showing at the Sundance film festival and is seeking distribution","54":"In 2018, film-makers Jesse Moss and Amanda McBaine struck gold \u2013 or, rather, tuned into it \u2013 when they attended a weeklong Texas program in which 1,000 teenage boys elect and run a mock state government. Their subsequent film, Boys State, bottled the potential and peril of the future \u2013 the idealism and ambition of youth, the capacity to change one\u2019s mind, the allure of power, the corrosive codes of masculinity \u2013 into two hours at once terrifying and hopeful, winning the 2020 Sundance documentary grand jury prize.Now the duo returns to the festival with Girls State, a similarly structured look at a Boys State sister program in Missouri. Though the mock government programs, run by the American Legion, remain (controversially, to some) separated by sex in the state, the film captures the first time in its 80-year history that the two coexist on the same campus, at the same time, in the summer of 2022. For the boys, it\u2019s business as usual, relayed in occasional snippets familiar from the first project \u2013 exercises on a football field, delegate meetings, rituals blessed by real-life politicians.The girls have a looser, less formal program, at least judging by the film\u2019s ambling first half, despite higher stakes; the participants gather weeks after the leaked Dobbs draft opinion overturning Roe v Wade. Their rights as decided by committee are very much top of mind, something everyone \u2013 a Catholic sticking to \u201cpro-life\u201d, a conservative who wouldn\u2019t push it on others, a pro-choicer schooled in the talking points of \u201cabortion is healthcare\u201d all at the same cafeteria table and trying to be friendly \u2013 seems to agree on.As in the first film, Moss and McBaine embed with several participants across the political spectrum, with various pains and ambitions, to fascinating effect. There\u2019s Emily, an almost scarily real-life Tracy Flick, blond and determined and brittle, a conservative pastor\u2019s daughter who announces her plan to run for president in 2040; she is one of several to run for governor, the week\u2019s highest office and most competitive position. She warily eyes Faith, her blond rival in doggedness, a young woman even less patient with societal expectations for female docility. (The program, perhaps unsurprisingly, skews white and blond; more than once, it resembles sorority rush.) Some, like Brooke, Maddie and Nisha, are less sure; part of the film\u2019s magnetic, if cliched, sweetness is in watching each grow their confidence over one intense, clarifying week.There\u2019s tartness, too \u2013 Tochi, one of the few Black participants, responds to questions from white girls who have no idea how to talk about her Nigerian heritage with clipped, firm politeness. \u201cI\u2019m having fun,\u201d says Cecilia, a proto-liberal activist, through gritted teeth as she debates Emily on gun control. All of the girls grow dismayed with the structure of the Girls State program, which Moss and McBaine keep somewhat frustratingly opaque, at least in the first half. Some of the rules are clear \u2013 girls must always go outside with a buddy for safety, girls must stay covered up (the boys have no such strictures, of course) \u2013 but there\u2019s no delineation of days nor context for what, exactly, the girls are doing as they walk around in groups or mill about in the cafeteria. The girls eventually seem frustrated by this, too \u2013 too much emphasis on cheery female empowerment and modesty, not enough on actual issues or, say, inequalities between the programs. As one puts it: \u201cI\u2019m a little sick of the fluff.\u201dGood thing the latter half of the film gets down to business: a mock supreme court case on Missouri\u2019s law requiring any woman seeking an abortion to get counseling, and then the governor\u2019s election, both rendered with the seriousness palpable in the room. As with Boys State, the directors smartly take a back seat, catching the pieces as they fall. The film\u2019s chief enjoyment is seeing how motivations transform, and character is forged, through the sliding doors of new people, victories and losses, and the sharpening of the young women\u2019s disparate judgments on the genuinely disappointing differences between boys and girls state. The apparent aimlessness of the week\u2019s first half coalesces into a point: these are not the same programs.And though they share similar sensibilities, these are not the same films. Necessarily so, as the dynamics of womanhood in politics \u2013 of getting people to believe you, of leadership, of conviction \u2013 are more steep and delicate than for the boys, interesting in a different way. If Girls State ties a neater bow on the individual mock government experience than its predecessor, it\u2019s with the gut-punch postscript that mere days after their session wrapped, the decision to overturn Roe v Wade became official. The votes in Girls State may have been symbolic, the words occasionally petty, the politicking fraught and sometimes annoying, but stakes are \u2013 and rightfully feel \u2013 very real.Girls State is screening at the Sundance film festival with a release to follow this year on Apple TV+","55":"The film-makers Kelly O\u2019Sullivan and Alex Thompson know their way around the peaks and valleys of the everyday. Their breakout 2019 feature Saint Frances, written and starring O\u2019Sullivan, sublimated what could be big strokes of drama \u2013 abortion, postpartum depression, getting older, lost time \u2013 into the unremarkable (on the outside) relationship between an aimless 34-year-old and her six-year-old nannying charge. The daily humors and challenges in one woman\u2019s life were not particularly dramatic or arresting, but rendered with such curiosity and acceptance as to feel radical.Ghostlight, the duo\u2019s new feature premiering at the Sundance film festival, traffics in a similar leveling of mundanity and insight. (It\u2019s also written by O\u2019Sullivan.) There\u2019s an appealing naturalness to the project, probably owing to its tight-knit origins: O\u2019Sullivan and Thompson are real-life partners directing a real-life family in their city, Chicago. Dan Mueller (Keith Kupferer) is an emotionally bottled construction worker, all slumped shoulders and soft mumblings, except for the few moments he bursts forth with startling rage. He\u2019s distant from wife Sharon (Kupferer\u2019s wife Tara Mallen), an elementary school music teacher seeking to reconnect. Neither know how to handle Daisy (their daughter Katherine Mallen Kupferer, bristling with talent), a high-schooler with a near-terminal case of teenage nightmare syndrome. It\u2019s often funny, how easily Daisy can escalate and derail a moment, until O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s finely tuned script and Mallen Kupferer\u2019s hot-blooded performance reveal just how derailed she is.As in Saint Frances, a chance encounter turns into a near-instant avenue for redemption: through contrivance and invitation, Dan ends up at a table read for a very DIY community theater production of Romeo and Juliet. The company is an island of misfit toys, according to its leader Rita, a hard-shelled ex-Broadway actor and self-described bitch played by Dolly De Leon. As in Triangle of Sadness, she blazes in every scene, not missing a single ego-deflating punchline. This production of Romeo and Juliet is not a glamorous gig, and Dan is not a natural theater actor. But the process of theater \u2013 exercises, rehearsal, bonding, fighting, garbling iambic pentameter \u2013 begin to open up his deep well of grief.The Kupferer-Mallens are Chicago theater stalwarts, having founded their own company, and the affection everyone involved with this project feels for the stage \u2013 as an art, therapy and practice \u2013 is so evident as to be contagious, even in the film\u2019s most theater-y meta moments. It helps that O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s default tone as a writer is sardonic, with an eye for human foibles and everyday indignities. The members of Rita\u2019s theater collective are, unsurprisingly but endearingly, eccentric theater types (in the case of one recently graduated college student harping about intimacy coordinators, a bit too much of a caricature). All talk the talk of getting into the headspace of a character, yet are never not themselves; their charming quirkiness buoys the film as it inches closer to the Muellers\u2019 unimaginable pain, the contours of which are steadily revealed over the film\u2019s two hours.O\u2019Sullivan demonstrated a penchant for heavy-handedness in Saint Frances, and dabbles in it here; the parallels between the Muellers\u2019 loss and Shakespeare\u2019s tragedy are a bit too square to buy. If anything, Ghostlight\u2019s crime is of being too well-structured, its alignment between the real and the pretend too synchronous to match the film\u2019s otherwise finely worn, wholly believable texture and Kupferer\u2019s sublime performance. That texture is at once familiar and rare. Though Dan and his family have experienced unusual, devastating grief, the scenery of their lives is ordinary, ornery and humbling: car horns, work sites, road rage; a talent-free elementary school musical; therapy appointments and lawyerly meetings for an upcoming deposition \u2013 the Muellers are involved in a lawsuit \u2013 in cookie-cutter offices. In other words, the vast yet underappreciated, on screen, purview of people in unsung places trying their best to make things work.Even when pockmarked with tragedy, the Muellers never feel special, in the typical cinematic sense of remarkable beauty, power or circumstances. But that doesn\u2019t make their experience, or the film\u2019s achievement in rendering the specific healing of one family, any less profound.Ghostlight is showing at the Sundance film festival and is seeking distribution","56":"Rather like the studio horror movie, the bar for the action comedy has lowered so dramatically that the mere act of not tripping over it headfirst is now considered enough. Modeled after an old-fashioned, something-for-him and something-for-her date-night formula, they tend to involve attractive stars smugly quipping at each other while sleekly avoiding pop-soundtracked gunfire, all theoretically allowing for the opportunity to show off dual personas, class clown and jock rolled into one.But the magic that was on display in 2005\u2019s magnetic Mr & Mrs Smith, a film that has arguably had the most visible, and damaging, impact on the genre in the almost two decades since (itself heavily in debt to 1994\u2019s True Lies), has been almost entirely absent in its many imitators. Last year\u2019s hauntingly awful Chris Evans-Ana de Armas starrer Ghosted acted as an almost instructive what-not-to-do, a punishing, unintentional parody of what these films have become in a year in which there seemed to be more of them than ever before. To kick off the new year with yet another \u2013 male-female pairing: check; one of them is a spy\/assassin: check \u2013 is not the most thrilling prospect but with many, many more to come in the next 12 months (Jamie Foxx and Cameron Diaz in Back in Action, Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt in The Fall Guy, Donald Glover\u2019s Mr & Mrs Smith TV series), it\u2019s about finding the silver lining where possible.For Amazon\u2019s Role Play, it\u2019s more like bronze, the great victory being that it\u2019s really not as atrocious as these films too often are, bar lazily stumbled over. A lot of that\u2019s down to what these films are usually saved by \u2013 star power \u2013 and while the stars in question here might be slightly lower-wattage, in industry terms at least, there\u2019s enough energy on display to almost power the whole thing, a sprint when a sleepwalk is usually deemed enough. It\u2019s becoming a familiar mode for Kaley Cuoco, a long-time sitcom star who received an unlikely career boost from the breakout hit The Flight Attendant and has been chasing that high ever since. That show\u2019s initially invigorating yet ultimately exhausting mix of comedy and thriller was also seen in her next film \u2013 the Kevin Hart vehicle The Man from Toronto \u2013 and her next show \u2013 last year\u2019s Based on a True Story.She\u2019s trying again here, playing a suburban mum who also happens to be a globe-trotting assassin, keeping that quiet from her husband, played by David Oyelowo. But the all-consuming nature of her job is starting to eat away at their relationship and after she forgets their anniversary, the pair decide to spice things up a bit, engaging in a bit of role play at a hotel in the city. They\u2019ll meet in the lobby, pretend to be strangers and take things back to a room. But when a nosey stranger, played by Bill Nighy, intervenes, things go awry.What follows is exactly what one would expect \u2013 a shootout, a chase, a shadowy organisation \u2013 but never enough of what one wouldn\u2019t, a familiar mish-mash in need of a persuaive reason to exist. It\u2019s a mostly adequate version of that movie \u2013 it\u2019s never as unfunny or as maddeningly incoherent as these things can be \u2013 but it\u2019s crucially lacking in such a way that I often forgot I was watching something self-contained, and that perhaps it were a pilot for a show, maybe by the end of the season I\u2019ll see why we\u2019re here again.Modulating the silly and the serious in a way that she often struggled with in Based on a True Story, Cuoco\u2019s performance does manage an awful lot of heavy lifting here, and she has some real chemistry with an all-in Oyelowo, the pair briefly showing us what they could do together with a script that was able to challenge them. But here there\u2019s never enough detail or perversity or gristle to catapult them from two-line types in a treatment to actual characters in a movie let alone something approximating real people. Thanks to the sorry state of the action comedy genre as is, Role Play isn\u2019t a total loss but it\u2019s still much too far from a win.Role Play is available on Amazon Prime on 12 January","57":"You know the Netflix formula: take a reliable box office trope \u2013 the big-budget action movie, the international spy thriller, the hitman and car chase bonanza \u2013 repackage it for the laptop screen with evermore disposable wrapping, attach a big name star with a hefty paycheck, release, move on. Such results \u2013 Sweet Girl, The Adam Project, The Gray Man, just to name a few \u2013 are often widely viewed yet under-discussed, throwaway blockbusters in the house style (overlit, frenetic) without much staying power or distinguishable flair. (To be fair to Netflix, this afflicts the other streaming services \u2013 does anyone remember Apple\u2019s Ghosted?)So there are well-worn and reduced expectations going into Lift, the latest collaboration between Netflix, the comedian Kevin Hart and a tried and true concept (in this case, clever thieves with expensive toys and menacing bad guys). The film does little to outrun them. You know from the first minute, in which Hart\u2019s debonair conman Cyrus Whitaker strolls confidently into a Venetian art auction, that this is a streaming action flick \u2013 stock characters, music video flairs, wealth porn, limp flashes of personality appealing to a low common denominator.At least Lift, written by Daniel Kunka, enlists the multiplex-tested know-how of F Gary Gray, director of The Italian Job, Straight Outta Compton and Fast & Furious 8 (as well as such music videos as Ice Cube\u2019s It Was a Good Day and TLC\u2019s Waterfalls). The plot in Lift is dumb in a way that\u2019s either entertaining or grating, depending on your preferences and current brain capacity. Such as: an opening heist plotline in Venice centered around an NFT, and then subsequent half-jokes about how NFTs were dismissed as a passing fad. But Gray knows how to direct a cacophonous action sequence, and the cat-and-mouse chase that plays out between Cyrus and the Interpol officer Abby Gladwell (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) in the canals of Venice is impressive and enjoyably stressful (I fear the wakes may sink the city faster).Hart, usually cast as the wacky, hapless foil, the good guy doing his best or the everyman sidekick (such as in The Man from Toronto, a Netflix action flick I reviewed but had to Google, so little did it stick), plays against type here as a hyper-competent leader of a heist ring who, of course, only steals from people who deserve it. It\u2019s an ill fit for his physical, loud brand of comedy, which can\u2019t help but poke through his attempts at suave charisma. Hart delivers such straight-faced lines as \u201cthe rules were already broken for someone like me\u201d with an awkward edge, like he\u2019s itching for a punchline.That line is used to (unconvincingly) charm Abby, with whom Cyrus once shared a five-day fling while both were undercover that curdled into distrust. For reasons that never make much sense but don\u2019t need to, Abby\u2019s boss Huxley (Sam Worthington, believably strained and skeevy) orders her to make peace with her art thief nemesis in the name of world peace; if Cyrus and his crew don\u2019t nick $50m worth of gold bars while in transit from London to Zurich, then the arch-evil billionaire Lars Jorgenson (Jean Reno) will pay hackers to wreak havoc for profit (he\u2019s shorted some stocks, or something; Northern Irish henchmen are involved).If this sounds like a bastardized version of Ocean\u2019s 11 with a Fast and Furious flavor, you would be correct. Still, Hart may not be a convincing crew boss, but again, Gray knows how to direct an action sequence. There\u2019s a baseline pleasure to watching the crew get to improbable work on stealing both the gold and the commercial jet ferrying it \u2013 the daredevil pilot Camilla (\u00darsula Corber\u00f3), the over-caffeinated safecracker Magnus (a delightful Billy Magnussen), the hacker Mi-Sun (Yun Jee Kim), the engineer Luc (Viveik Kalra) and the disguise expert Denton (Vincent D\u2019Onofrio). Maybe I\u2019m primed by a door falling off a Boeing 737 mid-air recently, but the in-flight sequences once the plot is afoot \u2013 time-crunched logistics, hand-to-hand combat during turbulence, a couple plane barrel rolls \u2013 raised my blood pressure.In other words, there\u2019s plenty to keep many viewers watching for its 1-hour, 44-minute runtime. But given the bare characterization for everyone and the total lack of chemistry between Hart and Mbatha-Raw (despite her best efforts), not enough to elevate Lift above its many forgotten peers.Lift is on Netflix on 12 January","58":"If you\u2019re not in the market for what David Ayer is forcefully selling in batty January thriller The Beekeeper at the point when someone says to the titular character, \u201cTo bee or not to bee, that is the bloody question,\u201d then you might as well just give up and walk out. By this stage, late in the film, Ayer and screenwriter Kurt Wimmer have given us just about enough bee puns, bone cracks and bizarre cameos from British actors to give those in the right headspace (read: drunk) a solid, low-stakes, medium-reward new year\u2019s effort. I can\u2019t imagine a devoted Beekeeper hive emerging any time soon (it\u2019s far too derivative and far too rough around the edges), but there\u2019s enough energy and well-pitched silliness to have audiences, ahem, swarming to cinemas this weekend.It\u2019s primed as Jason Statham\u2019s John Wick (not that the actor needs another franchise since out of his last 10 movies, only two were not part of a series) and its desperation to be so can often be distracting, but in a crowded landscape of equally desperate imitators, it makes a more persuasive case than most. Statham knows exactly what to do here, more than most would, and has figured out just how seriously, or not, to take such material. During the cold open, you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking that this was going to be more serious than most. He plays a withdrawn beekeeper working on land owned by a retired teacher, played by the luminous and wasted Phylicia Rashad. In a surprisingly wrenching set-up, she gets hoodwinked by a crooked call centre into allowing access to her accounts, leading to automatic bankruptcy and a self-inflicted bullet through the head. Statham is spurred into tackling the system that preyed on her and so a mission begins.It\u2019s an effectively involving motivator, although Ayer rushes through it so fast that one can sense his boredom shooting a scene without shooting (a shame as more of Rashad and her relationship with Statham wouldn\u2019t have gone amiss). It introduces her FBI agent daughter (a wildly unconvincing Emmy Raver-Lampman) and allows for the start of some hilariously rubbish dialogue delivered with a very grave face (\u201cTaking from an elderly person is as bad as stealing from a child ... maybe worse!\u201d) as well as many, often confusing, lines involving bees (\u201cWhen someone hurts an older person, sometimes they\u2019re left to face the hornets alone!\u201d). In screenwriter Kurt Wimmer\u2019s world, a beekeeper isn\u2019t just a beekeeper but is also a trained assassin, part of a hive protecting the queen bee, which means that the FBI agents on his trail are forced to, you know, read books on beekeeping to get to the bottom of this.Like most of these films, it\u2019s then structured like a video game all the way to the Big Bad Boss. Given that it was set in the US but filmed in the UK, these road stops involve an underused Minnie Driver, a snarling Jeremy Irons and a dead-behind-the-eyes Jemma Redgrave, none of them having anywhere near as much fun as Josh Hutcherson\u2019s obnoxious nepo baby tech bro. Bizarrely and ambitiously, the Beekeeper finds that the honey leads all the way to the White House and Wimmer aims to vaguely make some sort of commentary about the fine line between the evils of politics and the evils of big business. But then not really, he\u2019s not taking any of this all that seriously, proven in a finale that\u2019s all action and little talk (an ebulliently gory hallway fight scene is a real blast) and an end-note that clumsily leaves things open for more.Statham is ever the pro (one wonders if he\u2019s had enough training at this stage to make a dangerously good assassin for real), but it\u2019s all more of the same. His two non-franchise films of late showed how great he can be when afforded both a little more lightness (Operation Fortune) and a lot more darkness (Wrath of Man), and it would be satisfying to see him try something just a little out of the ordinary next. He works well with Ayer, who himself works better on a smaller, gnarlier scale, allowed more freedom to get nasty (his Suicide Squad remains a great-looking, what-if disaster). There\u2019s a grubby, late-night appeal to his dialled-up trash aesthetic and The Beekeeper mostly works because of it. Bee prepared for a sequel.The Beekeeper is in UK, Australian and US cinemas on 12 January","59":"The high school comedy of status-sadism now reaches the same third life-cycle stage already achieved by Hairspray, The Producers and The Color Purple: the movie, the stage musical version and then the movie version of that. My own dissident reaction to the 2004 original was a mean review based on feeling it was inferior to Clueless, Election and 10 Things I Hate About You, and that it had its cake and ate it on the prettiness-fascism issue.But I could have paid more attention to the showstopping individually funny lines; screenwriter Tina Fey after all went on to create an authentic masterpiece with TV\u2019s 30 Rock, in which she could more successfully represent in her own person the eternal Mean Girls themes of reconciling success with kindness. Moreover the Broadway Mean Girls was a big improvement on the film because the musical genre makes everything more amusingly histrionic \u2013 the \u201cdiva\u201d theme made explicit \u2013 and this movie version succeeds in the same way, although like the subsequent movie iteration it sags in the over-extended third act.Angourie Rice takes the role first played by Lindsay Lohan: she is sweet, unworldly teen Cady, once homeschooled by her academic mom in Kenya, and now relocated to the United States and having to fit in at high school where everyone is suspicious of this gawky (but beautiful) nerd. Fey reprises her role as maths teacher Ms Norbury, Jon Hamm plays an embarrassing sports-coach-slash-sexual-relations-counsellor \u2013 and there\u2019s another iconic cameo.In the time-honoured manner, newbie Cady is taken in hand and guided through the high-school jungle by the all-knowing alienated cynical types; great work here from Jaquel Spivey as Damian and Auli\u2019i Cravalho as Janis. They are also the movie choric narrators, bringing us into the action as if it is a 112-minute TikTok in a smartphone-shaped screen. Damian and Janis, outside the hetero-patriarchal power structure, are in an objective position to show wide-eyed Cady all the various in-crowds and power-bases, of which naturally the most fearsome are the terrifying \u201cplastics\u201d, the mean girls and Insta-princesses who rule the school.They are in turn ruled by the pouting queen of capricious blonde cruelty Regina, originally played by Rachel McAdams and now by Ren\u00e9e Rapp. It amuses Regina to pretend to welcome Cady into their group and Janis (who has history with Regina) encourages Cady to go along with it and infiltrate this hateful group - but could it be that Cady will like being a shallow blonde \u201cplastic\u201d? Among the mean girls themselves, the scene is stolen by Avantika as the outrageously vapid Karen; she gets the movie\u2019s best song, Sexy, in the Halloween party scene. Busy Phillips is funny as Regina\u2019s needy mom who wants to be one of her daughter\u2019s gang more than anything.There are plenty of laughs and fun along the way, but the business invoking framing Ms Norbury as a drug-pusher always feels strained and unconvincing, with insufficient laughs to make it worthwhile, while the final resolution and Cady\u2019s learning of life-lessons take a while to arrive. Some sugar-rush musical numbers, though, and the classic gags are effectively delivered.

Mind you, turnout for Sunday services yields barely enough souls for a game of five-a-side. But the community seems friendly enough to her and her husband Henry (Matt Stokoe), and they seem to have paid the family a compliment by choosing the Hollands\u2019 pre-pubescent daughter Grace to be some kind of angel with wheat sheaf wings for the upcoming harvest festival.Alas, it seems Rebecca has never watched The Wicker Man because, if she had, she would have understood exactly what\u2019s going on once Grace mysteriously disappears. Much of what follows is nearly a beat-for-beat rehash of director Robin Hardy and screenwriter Anthony Shaffer\u2019s immortal 1973 folk horror classic, albeit with some significant divergences from the template in the final act. But even those twists on the original twists are sort of predictable, and in general Lord of Misrule\u2019s director William Brent Bell (best known for the insipid Orphan prequel Orphan: First Kill) can\u2019t work up a proper head of suspense, no matter how many poppets made of human hair and twigs he hangs on trees, or how many creepy old ladies he sets roaming around the village muttering about local demons. Poor Rebecca seems pretty slow on the uptake anyway, even when she comes across explanatory murals pictorially explaining the ancient ways round these parts, just like the ones in Midsommar.Still, the film\u2019s best decision is to cast the great Ralph Ineson as an ambiguous local figure of note. With his basso profundo rumble of a voice and air of rough-hewn potency, he\u2019s always a striking figure on stage and screen. Having starred in Robert Eggers\u2019 The Witch and featured as the titular supernatural figure of mystery in The Green Knight, he\u2019s becoming to folk horror what Barbara Steele was to 1960s Italian creepfests such as Castle of Blood and The She Beast \u2013 and I, for one, am here for it. Lord of Misrule is released on 8 January on digital platforms.","61":"Who is James Payton? The simple answer is that James Payton is a jobbing actor. You\u2019ve probably seen him in something. His two claims to some kind of fame are blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-em parts in a couple of franchises: Neville Longbottom\u2019s dad in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, and Hitler in the first Captain America movie. Payton\u2019s other credits include \u201cgeography lecturer\u201d in The Crown and \u201cwasted guy\u201d in a terrible Jonathan Pryce thriller from 2005. The two franchises, however, have opened the door to a nice little side hustle: regional fan conventions where Payton sells signed photos of himself for \u00a310.The film follows him around the \u201ccons\u201d, where franchise fans queue to get a selfie with Harry Potter\u2019s mate\u2019s dad. Payton wonders how his life got to this? \u201cThere was me thinking that one day I\u2019d get nominated for a Bafta for some TV detective thing.\u201d It would be easy to take the mickey. And to be fair, sometimes this documentary comes over like a cross between The Office and The Trip, with a bit of Withnail and I thrown in. (There\u2019s a brilliant moment where a small kid heckles the world\u2019s most half-arsed wrestlers.) But Payton has a very dry sense of humour and he sees the funny side of staying in budget motorway hotels or twiddling his thumbs in an empty community hall.But going back to the title \u2013 I\u2019m not sure the film answers the question in any kind of satisfying manner. I would have liked a bit more prodding from director Oliver Guy-Watkins on the impact of the death of Payton\u2019s dad when he was 12 (which is when he decided to become an actor); his divorce; and his relationship with failure, working in an industry where failure is built in. The film can be a bit of a frustrating watch at times: not so much Who is James Payton? and more Why Should We Care? Who Is James Payton? is released on 4 January on digital platforms.","62":"Occupying the liminal space between a geological excavation and speculative realism, Emilija \u0160karnulyt\u0117\u2019s hypnotic documentary effortlessly moves between the micro and the macro. Zooming into a 3D-configuration of uranium ore, the film\u2019s opening cuts to X-ray-esque renderings of radioactive household objects, all cast in an eerie shade of sickly green. These abstractions soon give way to something seemingly concrete yet equally mysterious: the camera plunges underwater, bringing us face to face with the remains of a 1950s uranium mine in Poland, once dug out in secrecy under the Soviet Union. Slithering through the wreckage is a water python, whose glistening presence serves as a kind of cosmic counterpart to the exploitation of natural resources.Such slipperiness, both in terms of the imagery and the camera\u2019s point of view, recurs throughout \u0160karnulyt\u0117\u2019s film. Cutting to the Ignalina nuclear power station in Lithuania, a sister plant of Chernobyl, the film uses on-screen text to describe its decommissioning process, which produced millions of cubic metres of reinforced concrete structures to be demolished. This colossal waste will, hopefully, be processed at a research facility at Meuse in France, which is situated about 500 metres below sea level.Though moving through these highly technological spaces, \u0160karnulyt\u0117\u2019s film also makes space for bursts of surrealism. The python reappears in the Ignalina plant, as its gleaming form coils around the station\u2019s switchboards. Bringing together the lush forests, the mushroom clouds of nuclear tests, and closeups of a snake shedding its skin, Burial questions the very possibility of rebirth and transformation. Even as Ignalina is ground into dust and buried away from prying eyes, the political spectre of the Soviet Union control continues to lurk, as the film offers a final message of support for Ukraine. Burial is available from 5 January on True Story.","63":"A cat marooned on a desert island escapes, alongside an art connoisseur mouse, inside a floating harpsichord that somehow ends up in the Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg. And if you think that seems like a bafflingly random piece of plotting, it barely scratches the surface of this lamentably poor English-dubbed Russian animation. The cat, named Vincent (Jordan Worsley), joins forces with an elite feline squad of cultural protectors; the mouse, Maurice (Stephen Peter Krisel), views the contents of the gallery as his personal buffet. Oh, and there\u2019s a ghost. The Christmas holidays may be long, but life\u2019s too short to waste a minute of it with this nonsensical mess.","64":"Yet more evidence that the superhero movie industry is foundering comes from this shoddy, scraped-from-the-bottom-of-an-ocean-trench sequel. Jason Momoa, looking a bit like a beefed-up cartoon carrot in his wildly unflattering orange supersuit, returns as Arthur, the human-born heir to the kingdom of Atlantis. He divides his time between family life in a converted lighthouse with his wife, Mera (Amber Heard), their infant son, Arthur Jr, and his royal duties \u2013 largely crushingly dull council meetings with hostile merpeople. But an enemy from his past is back, and threatens not just Arthur asnd his people but the entire world, with the use of a long-abandoned Atlantean fuel that rapidly accelerates global heating.The lazily generic plot devices (yet again, an ancient evil artefact offers unlimited powers to its holder); performances so thuddingly clunky that much of the dialogue sinks like a boulder in the sea; the lack of any humour whatsoever: these are all minor irritations compared with the picture\u2019s glib trivialisation of the climate crisis. Time to put a barnacle in it, fish boy.","65":"Middle-aged Sue (Maggie O\u2019Neill) chalks up yet another romantic disappointment and prepares to re-enter the dating circuit, a large glass of red wine in hand. In the unlikely setting of her brother\u2019s funeral, she meets a taciturn, leather-clad biker named Ron (Tony Pitts). A connection between them seems to fill the vacuum of loneliness. But then Sue meets Ron\u2019s son Anthony (Harry Trevaldwyn), a flamboyant wannabe dancer and social media influencer. After a promising start, in which Sue and Anthony bond over Thai food and astrology, Anthony subsequently decides that he hates her.The uneven feature film debut from Leo Leigh (son of Mike, and it shows, in the film\u2019s prickly empathy for its abrasive characters), Sweet Sue works best as a portrait of a complex, not wholly likable woman. Where it falters is in the relationship between Sue and the increasingly withdrawn Ron, who retreats as a character while Sue and Anthony spit insults and sequins at each other.","66":"1. T\u00e1rReleased in the UK in JanuaryIt\u2019s been a banner year for fans of films about mercurial conductors\/composers, with Maestro, Bradley Cooper\u2019s mosaic portrait of Leonard Bernstein, a 2023 highlight. But Todd Field\u2019s creation of the magnificent, monstrous fictional conductor Lydia T\u00e1r, inhabited down to the last shred of cruelty and ambition by the remarkable Cate Blanchett, is exceptional: a savage, slippery account of rampant narcissism brought down to earth.2. How to Have SexNovemberA wealth of outstanding British first features has included Rye Lane (directed by Raine Allen-Miller), Scrapper (Charlotte Regan) and Earth Mama (Savanah Leaf) \u2013 and there are more to come in 2024.

The Boy and the Heron is a strikingly beautiful, densely detailed fantasy that revisits themes and devices familiar from previous films and ties them together with elements that have a clear autobiographical resonance for the director. The dream logic of the narrative seems to have been born from the untrammelled imagination of a child rather than that of a man in his 80s. The lush orchestral score, by regular Miyazaki collaborator Joe Hisaishi, is shimmering and exultant. All the elements are in place. So it seems almost churlish to note that this is middling Miyazaki at best.Of course, a mid-level Miyazaki film is still a vastly superior entity to much of the more cynically commercial content served up by Hollywood animation studios. And it\u2019s not as if the seductive spell has been entirely broken. But compared with, say, the beguiling simplicity of My Neighbour Totoro, or the richly realised world of Spirited Away, this sometimes feels heavy going. Some of that trademark Miyazaki magic has been stifled by overplotted, incoherent storytelling and an unwieldy final third act.The backdrop, for some of the picture at least, before it slips into parallel realms, is early 1940s wartime Japan. The boy of the title is 12-year-old Mahito (voiced by Soma Santoki in the Japanese original version and Luca Padovan in the impressive English-language dub). Shortly before the main action takes place, Mahito loses his mother in a hospital fire after a bombing raid on Tokyo. The inferno engulfing the city has a disorientating, impressionistic quality that\u2019s distinct from the precise visual style of the rest of the film, and this striking image of a burning city is one that Miyazaki has cited as one of his earliest childhood memories. Mahito\u2019s father is the boss of a factory that manufactures fighter planes (as was the director\u2019s own father). He remarries, to his late wife\u2019s younger sister Natsuko (Yoshino Kimura\/Gemma Chan), and the still grieving Mahito is forced to relocate from Tokyo to the country estate where his mother and Natsuko both grew up. It\u2019s a curious, cavernous place, populated by a staff of bickering, ancient crones; it comes with a lake and a bricked-up, semi-derelict tower in its grounds.It also has another resident: an insolent grey heron (Masaki Suda\/Robert Pattinson) that seems to be taking a particular beaky interest in Mahito. At the goading behest of the heron, Mahito enters the forbidden tower and finds himself drawn into a netherworld where timelines are knitted together and the infrastructure of the whole domain is controlled by some kind of high-stakes Jenga game. Fellow inhabitants of this world include Kiriko (K\u00f4 Shibasaki\/Florence Pugh), a dashing sailor and fisherwoman who is skilled in magic, and the fire maiden Himi (Aimyon\/Karen Fukuhara), as well as Mahito\u2019s new stepmother, Natsuko, and a community of giant man-eating parakeets.For a director who is so famously preoccupied with the idea of flight, Miyazaki reveals an unexpectedly complicated relationship with birds in this picture. In addition to the monstrous parakeets that eye Mahito greedily, cutlery at the ready, there is also a flock of pelicans that feed on gentle floating creatures called the Warawara. And then there\u2019s the heron, which soon loses its elegant avian form and morphs into one of Miyazaki\u2019s less lovely creations, a wart-encrusted, goblin-like henchman in service to the ruler of this magic kingdom \u2013 an ageing wizard who, it turns out, has a connection to Mahito\u2019s family. Ultimately, family \u2013 even a fractured, imperfect family scarred by loss \u2013 is elevated, forming the central spine of this picture, as it does in so many of Miyazaki\u2019s movies.Where this film stumbles is in its use of space and pacing. The unbounded fantasies of Miyazaki\u2019s imagination work best if they are physically contained in some way \u2013 within the bathhouse of Spirited Away, the enchanted forest of Totoro, the castle in Howl\u2019s Moving Castle. Here, the world in which Mahito finds himself is vast and limitless, and the director fills it \u2013 with characters, locations and exposition \u2013 until the whole film starts to feel a little cluttered. You long for a moment of stillness, an opportunity such as that offered by the bus-stop scene in Totoro, for contemplation and the chance to fully inhabit the miraculous creations of Miyazaki\u2019s mind, rather than being bombarded by them.In UK and Irish cinemas from 26 December","68":"You\u2019d have to have a heart of brick to take against this earnest musical drama from Hong Kong about a single parent in an indie band dealing with her failed rocker dad suddenly walking back into her life (after leaving 20 years ago when she was little). It\u2019s a warm and watchable valentine to music and starting afresh. But I did find something a bit make-believe and naive in its feelgood message about the power of music to heal old wounds; the idea that a sentimental chord or two could strum away the kind of pain and resentment it can take years of therapy to work through.Cantopop star Kay Tse plays Cat, lead singer of Band Four, and single mum to pint-sized drumming prodigy Riley (Rondi Chan). Cat nursed her own mum through years of illness, and it\u2019s at the funeral that her dad King makes an appearance \u2013 all of five foot nothing, a ponytail, rock star sunglasses and leather jacket. Real-life musician Teddy Robin Kwan plays it beautifully; beneath the swagger there\u2019s an unmistakable air of genuine regret. King is back to make amends to Cat and he\u2019s got a surprise: a teenage daughter, her half-sister. Cat is fuming but King shamelessly ingratiates himself with little Riley, who is delighted by his new grandpa and auntie.When you twig that each of the four family members can play an instrument, and that Cat\u2019s indie group is imploding, you know exactly where this is headed. It\u2019s not helped by director Mo Lai Yan-chi pushing too many buttons, one after the other, and piling on tragic backstories and emotionally complicated relationships. Still, there\u2019s real sweetness and charm to the movie. I found it impossible to resist its unabashed romanticism, or the sweet ending that\u2019s not about finding love, or fame, but happiness in the family. That said, for a film about music starring actual musicians, the songs are a bunch of forgettable drifty indie mumblers. Band Four is released on 15 December in UK cinemas.","69":"There was much to admire, earlier this year, in the first rollicking film in Martin Bourboulon\u2019s two-picture adaptation of Alexandre Dumas\u2019s classic: the swaggering fight choreography, the ostentatious insults parried along with the swordplay, the combined charisma of the musketeers (Vincent Cassel, Romain Duris and Pio Marma\u00ef) and D\u2019Artagnan (Fran\u00e7ois Civil), which was only slightly obscured by a period-appropriate layer of sweat and grime. But the main attraction was an irresistible Eva Green, mercurial and merciless as the treacherous Milady, a spy and general agent of mischief in the French court. If anything, this follow-up is even more enjoyable, its appeal boosted by Milady slinking on to centre stage, her weaponised sexuality backed up by her private collection of daggers and swords.The Three Musketeers: Milady picks up where the first film left off, the atmosphere at court thick with treasonous plotting, after a foiled attempt on the life of the king (Louis Garrel, stealing every scene with his air of bewigged ennui). D\u2019Artagnan, abducted and facing torture at the hands of the granite-faced henchman of the Comte de Chalais (Patrick Mille), forms a temporary alliance with Milady. Meanwhile, war has been declared and the musketeers head to the front at the port of La Rochelle, where a bracingly vigorous action sequence follows a daring assault on a fort.The film fairly gallops through big chunks of plot, pausing only for Milady\u2019s repeated corset-clad seduction attempts on a befuddled D\u2019Artagnan; a bonding moment between Athos (Cassel) and his son; family strife for Aramis (Duris); and toilet breaks for the permanently wine-sodden Porthos (Marma\u00ef). There\u2019s a hint at the end about the possibility of further movies in the series: here\u2019s hoping.","70":"George Clooney has been a charming and dapper Anglophile presence on the awards circuit this season while promoting the new movie he\u2019s directed, some of which was shot not far from where he lives near Henley-on-Thames. So it\u2019s sad to report that his film clunks harder than redwood. It is a stodgy and sententious varsity-sports underdog drama from the Depression era, a bit like his 1920s American football film Leatherheads, from 2008, but minus the comedy. Weirdly, it is as if this earnest but perfunctorily imagined film is always ordering us to feel nostalgic and sentimental about a time and place of which no one involved can have any real memory or feeling.It tells the true story of how a gutsy crew of nine guys from the humble University of Washington battled to compete for Olympic rowing gold at the Berlin games in 1936, shrugging off Ivy League snobs and Nazi cheats along the way. Screenwriter Mark L Smith (who co-scripted Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu\u2019s The Revenant) has adapted Daniel James Brown\u2019s bestselling book of the same title, and Clooney directs. Joel Edgerton plays gruff and taciturn coach Al Ulbrickson, who takes the sensational decision to take his junior crew of young talents to the Olympics rather than the more seasoned seniors, and then rages at the sneering obstructionists among the US rowing authorities who would prefer the Waspy east coast bluebloods to compete for America rather than his blue-collar team who are actually better at rowing. (You might remember the meanie Winklevoss twins from David Fincher\u2019s The Social Network in a later era: entitled snobs who learned their habits of superiority in a rowing crew at Harvard.)British actor Callum Turner plays Joe Rantz, a lonely kid from a broken home who often went hungry during his studies and got into rowing to pay for his course. Peter Guinness is British-born boatbuilder George Pocock. In Berlin, Jyuddah Jaymes plays Jesse Owens, who politely tells his cornfed, puzzled white teammates that he\u2019s running to prove his point against the bigots in America rather than Germany. And Daniel Philpott has a Mel-Brooks-ish cameo as the bad-loser F\u00fchrer himself, growling and scowling at US success.The overall effect is sturdy and unsubtle, with some very strong racing scenes which certainly toy with the audience\u2019s expectation that surely one of these tense competitions will involve the character-building experience of losing. The Poughkeepsie Regatta features the rather amazing (and historically accurate) spectacle of cheering onlookers being carried along beside the river on a converted open railway carriage. But the dialogue scenes are often frankly comic-book level, both strident and wooden. When Joe meets-cute with his sweetheart Joyce (Hadley Robinson) they have a deafeningly loud flirtatious conversation in what appears to be a library, with other extras gazing at their books, evidently in a trance. The inner life of Coach Ulbrickson is an uninteresting mystery and that excellent performer Edgerton is wasted.You might call this a film in the booster-ish spirit of old Hollywood pictures such as Knute Rockne, All American from 1940, with Ronald Reagan as the heartwrenchingly brave football star George \u201cthe Gipper\u201d Gipp. George \u201cthe Cloonster\u201d Clooney is capable of putting much more on the scoreboard; this feels like an animatronic museum display.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotion The Boys in the Boat is released on 25 December in the US, on 4 January in Australia and 12 January in the UK","71":"Zack Snyder pitched Rebel Moon as a marriage of Seven Samurai and Star Wars, which is a bit like trying to sell your new invention as the wheel meets sliced bread. The former channeled all of Akira Kurosawa\u2019s estimable powers in blocking, lighting and composition for battles that still merit the nearly exhausted descriptor of \u201cepic\u201d; the latter was a once-in-a-millennium Big Bang of raw movie stardom, snappy dialogue and transportive production design that turned a mid-budget space oddity into a culture-straddling phenomenon; both are fundamentally impossible to replicate. And so Lucasfilm passed on Snyder\u2019s tall order, as did Warner Bros (more than once), until the good people at Netflix uncinched their readily loosened purse strings for what had gradually become the blockbuster king\u2019s longest-simmering passion project.Yet the finished product has only the vaguest contours of ambition, diminished by a half-assedness dinkifying the latest CGI-jammed saga to decide the fate of the universe. If it can be considered complete at all, that is \u2013 this 134-minute film really only covers the getting-the-gang together phase that most movies in the genre knock out within the first half hour, a fragment of story to be wrapped up with a second installment next year. One hopes that Snyder has saved the good stuff for his climactic conclusion, and not just the grand clashes conspicuously absent from an adventure that fits and belongs on a laptop. (Longtime Snyderheads may happen upon the epiphany that his trademark slow-mo action tableaux look like screensavers more than anything else.) There\u2019s still time for him to add character development to his ragtag band of cardboard cutouts, a tactility to his nondescript greenscreened locations, a deeper sense of meaning to the stultifyingly generic plot, and everything else that leaves a sort of polished nothingness in its lack. But by the end credits, expecting anyone to come back and find out feels like asking a lot.In film school, some professors use the familiar example of Star Wars to teach Campbellian mythmaking, the theories that identify and codify the narrative units re-contextualized since Grecian times. Snyder demonstrates a clear fluency in these concepts with his classically minded scripting, except he forgot the part where the archetypes are meant to be refreshed through novel contexts. On the humble farming planet of Wherever in the galaxy of Who Cares, the broad outline of a Hero (Sofia Boutella, terse and humorless and physically perfect, just how Snyder likes \u2019em) must defend her village from a faraway notion of an Evil Empire. They rose to power in some great cataclysm of yore during which our Hero\u2019s family was killed, and the Final Boss took her in to teach her the combat skills she\u2019d one day use to take her revenge. Snyder mistakes exposition for world-building, the lugubriously delivered reams of backstory removing the audience from the fantasy rather than immersing them in it.To topple the Mini-Boss (Ed Skrein, his British accent and high cheekbones marking him as a baddie) come to appropriate her people\u2019s grain, she and her Sidekick (a neutered Michiel Huisman) bop around the cosmos rounding up sympathizers to their cause, including a self-interested yet caddishly likable mercenary we\u2019ll call Not Han Solo (Charlie Hunnam, more visibly awake than most of his scene partners). They are most easily referred to by their function both because they exist as little more than sketches, and because the muddy sound mix isn\u2019t doing viewers any favors, but especially because their names are often long and difficult to retain. Others are catchier, but never for good reasons. General Titus (Djimon Hounsou) and the squid-faced King Levitica offer arbitrary allusions for which the writing never makes any attempt to account. Some are just silly, like the brother-sister warriors surnamed Blood Axe, or Skrein\u2019s effete colonist answering to Atticus Noble.Despite a few nifty creature designs, the handful of eccentricities never add up to a more colorful sense of personality; a fleshy parasite using its human host as a ventriloquist dummy hangs out in Snyder\u2019s equivalent of the Mos Eisley cantina, but his wretched hive of scum and villainy has the clean interior decor and warm natural light of an upscale sushi restaurant. Even when sci-fi goes horribly awry, it usually yields some memorable weirdness, a tradeoff that\u2019s endeared the likes of Jupiter Ascending or Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets to their self-selecting cults. No such luck in this case, with Snyder\u2019s po-faced sensibility totally bereft of humor, intentional or otherwise. He envisioned the fight for Somewhere-or-Other as his masterpiece, its sprawling cumulative runtime and expansive scope unprecedented in his career. Going mad with power should be at the very least fun, exhilarating in the indulgence of an artist\u2019s most outlandish whims. Instead, Snyder\u2019s would-be magnum opus is merely boring.Rebel Moon \u2013 Part One: A Child of Fire is now out in select cinemas and will be on Netflix on 22 December","72":"A San Francisco Bay Area single mother with two children who have already been sucked into the foster-care system, Gia (a revelatory performance from Oakland rapper Tia Nomore) is pregnant with her third child. Heavily so. Her belly seems cumbersome and incongruous on her slight frame. Brief fantasy interludes that cut into the naturalistic, almost documentary-style observational approach of this impressive feature debut suggest that Gia is deeply conflicted by her pregnancy and by the umbilical emotional connection that she already feels with the baby.It becomes clear that the unborn child in her belly is not the only weight that Gia carries. A hostile, punitive society seems designed to knock back poor Black women at every opportunity. Her weekly supervised meetings with her children are the happiest moments of her life \u2013 and the most painful. To regain custody, she must attend a rigorous schedule of drug rehabilitation classes and counselling sessions; she also has to pay child support. But to earn enough money, she needs more hours at work, something she can\u2019t take on because of the time commitments of her state-mandated classes.It\u2019s a supremely confident first feature from London-born, California-raised director Savanah Leaf, who won best debut director at the Bifas last week. Her storytelling is subtly understated but visually eloquent. Images, rather than words, are the currency in which Leaf trades, with particular emphasis on long, unbroken shots of Nomore\u2019s endlessly expressive face as she wrestles with her impossible situation. It\u2019s bleak at times, but there is a defiantly celebratory aspect to the film, which finds hope in the solidarity of Black women and dignity in Gia\u2019s quiet stoicism.","73":"One could be cynical and see this transposition of the Riverdale narrative universe into an Indian setting as just another exercise in brand colonialism, pasteurising youth culture one country at a time with deadly doses of emulsifying intellectual property. Or one could just chillax and dance along to the formidably catchy songs, performed with zip by the peppy and exceedingly well choreographed cast. While one is grooving along, it\u2019s worth noting that every so often the film-makers have smuggled in a quietly subversive thought, such as in the song Everything Is Politics which argues, pace Marxist philosopher Louis Althusser, that there is no position outside the ideological apparatus. It\u2019s that very dualism which makes this goofy musical fascinating, a guilt-free pleasure that\u2019s nevertheless super-corny and ridiculous.Like the American Archie comics on which this is based, the story here takes place in a mythical town called Riverdale \u2013 except this Riverdale was founded in northern India by Anglo-Indians, as explained in an opening animated sequence. After independence, the residents of Riverdale planted trees in the names of their children to commemorate their newfound freedom and hope for the future, creating the municipal space Green Park in the centre of town. But, in the 1964 of the film, the now-teenage kids like rock\u2019n\u2019roll and miniskirts, they consider going abroad for university and are blithely unaware that things are changing in less savoury ways. Local oligarch Mr Lodge (Alyy Khan), father of high-school rich girl Veronica (Suhana Khan), has plans to develop the Green Park and plonk a grand hotel in the middle of it.This will affect the residents in different ways. For example, a landlord decides to close the bookshop where Hal (Satyajit Sharma), the father of Veronica\u2019s best friend Betty (Khushi Kapoor), is the manager, putting Hal out of a job unless he accepts a position with a more profit-centric book chain. Meanwhile, teen heartthrob Archie Andrews (Agastya Nanda), clearly working on a sex and love addiction that will trouble him in later life, thinks his biggest problem in life is trying to decide whether he fancies Veronica or Betty more. The aforementioned songs explaining that Everything Is Politics put him right on that score, but the kids still have to gather enough signatures to overturn the city council\u2019s decision to allow the rezoning of Green Park.That plot summary might make this sound much more like an episode of the darkish North American-set Archie-spinoff TV series Riverdale. But all of the above unfolds in a place that is very much recognisable as a version of rural India of the period: people speak a mashup of Hindi and English, older women wear saris, and Bollywood is the dominant cultural touchstone in the dance numbers, even when everyone is wearing rollerskates. The whole shebang is quite bizarre but sort of works, thanks to the brisk pacing of the editing and the joie de vivre that director Zoya Akhtar injects into the proceedings. The Archies is released on 7 December on Netflix","74":"Here\u2019s a gossipy, nostalgic and really quite lovely documentary about the New Romantics, the scene best remembered for the flouncy shirts and extreme makeup, as told by some of the key players. The New Romantics (as they would never have dreamed of calling themselves) were arty kids in London in the late 70s and early 80s; the scene evolved out of punk, and was born on the dancefloor of the Blitz club in Covent Garden where Boy George worked as coat-check attendant (so he could steal out of coat pockets, apparently). The door policy was brutal \u2013 Mick Jagger got turned away. \u201cBut all the freaks got in for free.\u201dAnd what freaks. This was the Thatcher era of grim recession and a lot of the \u201cBlitz kids\u201d lived in a squat in Warren Street in four of five Georgian houses knocked together. It was filthy but brilliant: you had to wear wellies to go to the loo, and most of the residents were on the dole. (\u201cWho was going to give us jobs looking like that?\u201d). But they were compulsively creative, making films, music, fashion, art. Clearly, a lot of time \u2013 a lot! \u2013 was spent dressing up, putting together DIY extravagant looks. A woman remembers travelling on the tube with her nipples painted red, wearing nothing but \u201ca bit of muslin\u201d. One drag queen carried concrete in her handbag for self-defence against homophobic attacks. The scene sounds like a sixth form, full of petty squabbling and rivalries; there\u2019d be a fight on the dancefloor if someone stole your look.In hindsight there\u2019s something quaint, endearing even, about the New Romantics mentality. They were desperate to be famous, but didn\u2019t give a hoot about making money. Today, they\u2019d all be influencers earning thousands of pounds from brands. Many went on to be leaders in their fields, including Boy George, choreographer Michael Clark and film-maker John Maybury. It\u2019s Maybury who reminds director Kevin Hegge not to forget the queer influence. It\u2019s often left out of documentaries, he says, because so many young gay men were lost to Aids \u2013 \u201ca typhoon of death\u201d. What a desperately sad ending.Tramps! is released on 11 December on digital platforms.","75":"Where many thrillers programmatically crank up tension with every scene and every beat, Devashish Makhija\u2019s third feature feels different; this manhunt is weighed down by an almost agonised oppressiveness. Joram\u2019s protagonist Dasru (Manoj Bajpayee) is barely able to choose a course of action until compelled out of desperation, and his police pursuer Ratnakar (Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub) is not much better. There\u2019s no escape in this pressure cooker from omnipresent societal exploitation and cynicism \u2013 with only Makhija\u2019s compassion for the marginalised to compensate.A tattooed member of the \u201cscheduled tribes\u201d from the eastern state of Jharkhand, Dasru lives in exile as a Mumbai labourer. When Phulo Karma (Smita Tambe), a tribal leader from the same region, pitches up on his construction site electioneering, she recognises him from his former life: a jungle rebel fighting against the appropriation of local lands by her husband\u2019s iron-ore mining outfit. Dasru is bewildered when he comes home to find his wife Vaano (Tannishtha Chatterjee) brutally murdered and trussed upside down, forcing him to flee into the streets with his three-month-old daughter Joram in a sling.Dasru makes a beeline for his Jharkhand heartland, with Ratnakar browbeaten into following. But the chase is all the more convincing because of how shambolic it is, with the setpieces seeming hapless and improvised. It amounts to a reduction of options, not a Hollywood-esque building climax, especially in a riveting sequence in a set of train corridors. Makhija shoots the urban clutter of half-built tower blocks and railway sidings with a jittery noirish lustre, and later loosens up into satire to burnish the theme of \u201cprogress\u201d encroaching on rural life. The bent Jharkhand cops, in a region known for totemic tree worship, all keep their mobile phones in little cages attached to one.This downhill rolling tussle between the modern and the traditional always keeps an eye on a mythic horizon; for example, in the baleful sight of a tree with a terrible meaning as the only thing left standing in a blasted quarry. Tambe holds a formidable death stare as the vengeful magnate, and Ayyub is also good as the empathic Ratnakar. But Bajpayee, who broke out in the gritty 1998 gangster epic Satya, is made for clammy realism; largely mute, clasping his baby bundle, recoiling in panic as his eyes try to flee his head, he is like a refugee from Fritz Lang\u2019s M. A plea on behalf of India\u2019s dispossessed. Joram is released in cinemas on 8 December.","76":"William Oldroyd\u2019s follow-up to his superb feature debut, Lady Macbeth, Eileen is a 60s-set sapphic neo-noir that sees a gauche younger woman (Thomasin McKenzie) entranced by a sophisticated new co-worker (Anne Hathaway) at a Massachusetts young offenders facility. McKenzie plays Eileen as a girl who is upstaged by her own shapeless beige cardigan; it\u2019s no wonder she\u2019s fascinated by brassy blonde Rebecca, who matches her scarlet leather gloves to her sports car.And for a while at least, we fall under the same spell \u2013 against a world-weary bluesy score and an evocatively down-at-heel, small-minded, small-town backdrop, Rebecca is an impossibly exciting presence. Hathaway is magnetic, purring her way around the baked-in misogyny of the potato-faced local men. But then a third-act tonal shift knocks the whole film off balance. Rebecca remains impossibly glamorous, but she is no longer believable as a character.","77":"As this Norwegian-made children\u2019s feature begins, it\u2019s coming up to Christmas time and tween Mariann (Marte Klerck-Nilssen) and her little brother (Vegard Strand Eide) are trimming the tree with extraordinary intra-sibling harmony. The era seems to be somewhere in the middle of the last century judging by the type of cars on the streets, the lack of semiconductor-driven toys and gadgets and, to an extent, the clothes \u2013 though Norwegians\u2019 fondness for traditional dress, especially when it comes to loppisgenser or \u201cflea\u201d pattern sweaters and chunky wool toques, makes nailing the period a challenge.The important thing is that this unfolds in a utopian past full of good cheer, Christmas markets and magic that brings toys to be won at a spin-the-wheel stall to life, like the teddy bear of the title, which is dubbed into English with the voice of Zachary Levi. Mariann wins the teddy legitimately, but the furry scamp moves the wheel when no one is looking so that he has a chance to be won by an adult instead, who will take him to see the world. You see, he doesn\u2019t understand how nice it is to be loved and cuddled by a child, although you can bet krone to kransekake he\u2019ll learn about them by the end.Teddy has a \u201cB\u201d plot adventure as he is bought by an international man of mystery and meets a chatty plush hedgehog, while Mariann learns why breaking and entering is wrong, a life lesson surely all parents will get behind. Grandparents come to visit, little brother has an existential crisis over whether Santa is really his father, his actual dad (Jan Gunnar R\u00f8ise) takes a bravura pratfall over the newly decorated Christmas tree, and mum (Mariann Hole, sporting a truly gorgeous teased-up tousled blond bob) manages not to burn the rice pudding. This one has all the Norwegian drama of Yuletide in one tidy package, yes sir.If you are not a child under the age of eight or nine, you may find yourself distracted by scrutinising how the film-makers have tried to disguise the disconnect between the actors speaking their original Norwegian and the requirement to dub into other languages. This means no one\u2019s mouth is visible for too long, and if possible moustaches are deployed to disguise lip movements. Obviously, that doesn\u2019t work so well between children and women, so they mug a lot for the camera in order to distract attention from their mouths. The animation, incidentally, is seamlessly executed and quite charming. Teddy\u2019s Christmas is released on 1 December in UK and Irish cinemas.","78":"Revenge is rarely a tidy business. But Femme, a savagely sexy queer erotic thriller, explores just how messily complex retribution can be. Set against a fretful, pulsing electronic score and unfolding in a world of sordid neons, it follows an east London drag artist who enters into a highly charged sexual relationship with his unwitting gay basher.Written and directed by first-time feature film-making duo Sam H Freeman and Ng Choon Ping, this is a teasing, slippery picture \u2013 a power-shifting tussle between out gay man Jules (Nathan Stewart-Jarrett, excellent) and his tightly wound closeted attacker Preston (George MacKay), neither of whom are quite who or what they say they are. Jules and Preston are both skilled in slipping into other skins and identities. Jules\u2019s drag alter ego, Aphrodite, is fearless and fabulous. \u201cShe was the real me and I was the performance,\u201d says Jules, mourning the loss of his bolder persona. After the street attack by Preston, Jules no longer feels able to perform. And Preston jealously guards his sexuality from his gang of friends, with their bared teeth, hyena laughs and pack mentality. It\u2019s bold, unflinching and almost unbearably tense.","79":"\u201cWhen will the world end?\u201d There\u2019s a great deal of uncertainty in the life of seven-year-old Sol (Na\u00edma Sent\u00edes) right now, so she takes her mother\u2019s phone to a quiet corner away from the bustle in her grandfather\u2019s house and puts her big question to Siri. The little girl has picked up enough from the fragments of conversation of the adults thronging in the house to understand that, while the end is still a way off, her world, or at least part of it, is about to change for ever.The second film from Mexican actor turned writer-director Lila Avil\u00e9s, T\u00f3tem is exquisite \u2013 a vital ensemble drama that\u2019s suffused with joy and love. Taking a child\u2019s-eye view of the controlled chaos of preparations for a birthday party in honour of Sol\u2019s terminally ill father, Tonatiuh (Mateo Garc\u00eda Elizondo), it deftly balances grief against celebration; the shadow of death against a frame that is perpetually teeming with life (human, insect, animal and a goldfish named Nugget).It\u2019s a picture that cements Avil\u00e9s as one of the brightest talents in a new wave of female Mexican directors \u2013 a movement that also includes Tatiana Huezo (Prayers for the Stolen), Fernanda Valadez (Identifying Features) and Issa L\u00f3pez (Tigers Are Not Afraid). T\u00f3tem also represents a marked step up in terms of ambition and scope. Avil\u00e9s\u2019s widely acclaimed debut, The Chambermaid (2019), was a contained, subdued character study that followed the daily routine of a maid in a high-end luxury hotel in Mexico City. Like the diligent, quiet woman at its centre, it was hyper-observant, unusually tuned in to tiny details.T\u00f3tem shares an instinctive, naturalistic approach with The Chambermaid but is more exuberant and intuitive, a free-flowing, multifaceted portrait of an extended family. The meticulous, minute details are still there, and the camera is attuned to them, but there\u2019s something more satisfyingly complex at play here \u2013 a harmony of energies (and occasional moments of discord) that depicts the family both as individuals and as a single entity, a living, breathing creature. Avil\u00e9s cites the work of John Cassavetes as an influence and describes the picture as a \u201cchoral\u201d film. It\u2019s a term that perfectly captures the minor key tenderness and attentiveness of T\u00f3tem\u2019s embrace.Grief hits everyone differently. Sol\u2019s aunt, Tonatiuh\u2019s sister Nuria (Montserrat Mara\u00f1on), shaved off her hair in solidarity with her brother after his cancer diagnosis, only to note, wryly, that he has managed to keep his flowing locks intact. Nuria numbs her pain with several bottles of wine and channels her love into a birthday cake, painted in the style of Van Gogh and fine-tuned obsessively in the kitchen while the party is in full swing in the garden. Finishing it, you sense, is a step that Nuria is unwilling to take, symbolic of severing yet another link with her brother.Meanwhile, her sister, Ale (Marisol Gas\u00e9), pays for a grifter spiritualist to rid the house of negative energy (\u201cI also sell Tupperware,\u201d says the opportunistic medium, having price-gouged Ale on the cost of an exorcism). Sol\u2019s grandfather (Alberto Amador) gives his son the gift of a bonsai tree that he has cultivated for the past seven years. We see in Tonatiuh\u2019s anguished smile of thanks that the tree is certain to outlive him. And in a heartbreakingly poignant scene, Sol and her actor mother, Luc\u00eda (Iazua Larios), put on a clown-wigged comedy performance in honour of the occasion.There is no score, only the party playlist the characters hear. But Avil\u00e9s finds music in the rhythms of the conversations, in particular the shorthand exchanges and in-jokes between family members who know each other inside out. In this aspect, I suspect that non-Spanish speakers relying on the subtitles \u2013 myself included \u2013 may be missing out on some of the subtleties of Avil\u00e9s\u2019s screenplay. But the film\u2019s visual language is universal. Lithe, long takes weave between the legs of adults and turn the furniture into a playground. There\u2019s a wayward sense of adventure in the way the camera moves within the walls of the house, reflecting a seven-year-old\u2019s curiosity and quest for discovery. And the lyrical, recurring motif of animals and insects \u2013 a device also used in another film about terminal disease, Shannon Murphy\u2019s Babyteeth (2019) \u2013 gives a sense of continuity and connection with the wider natural world, and an acceptance of the beauty and inevitability of cycles of life and death.","80":"Here is a classic example of a film you root for, fervently willing it to be brilliant. It\u2019s got Joel McHale from Community in it \u2013 great. It\u2019s got Justin Long committing to a bit as a Trump-style property baron with blond hair and spray tan \u2013 fabulous. Even more exciting: there\u2019s a role for Katharine Isabelle, star of beloved turn-of-the-century horror comedy Ginger Snaps, as a cool lesbian aunt.The premise is fun, too: a loose remake of It\u2019s a Wonderful Life as a comedy-horror about a teenage girl called Winnie Carruthers (Jane Widdop), whose life goes to hell after she kills a masked maniac. This leads her to wish she had never been born \u2013 a wish then somehow granted by the cosmos. In turn, this gives said masked maniac a free hand to establish a reign of terror over the little town of Angel Falls.But sometimes you can have all the right ingredients and the recipe doesn\u2019t quite pan out as you\u2019d hoped. It\u2019s a Wonderful Knife is diverting enough to start with, as the plot clicks efficiently into motion with the requisite stabbings and impalings. Unfortunately, there\u2019s not enough fuel in the engine \u2013 the characters don\u2019t have quite enough to do, we can\u2019t care quite enough about them, and the world-building is nearly-but-not-quite convincing.Some of the comedy-horror tropes employed here call to mind the likes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer \u2013 which in fact did something similar in the episode The Wish, which imagined the titular slayer never came to the vampire-ridden town of Sunnydale. But TV enjoys an advantage over film in at least one respect: the runtime of a single episode, on average, doesn\u2019t need as much sustenance as a feature film, and what works very well at 40 minutes just feels stretched out at 90. It\u2019s a Wonderful Knife is released on 1 December on Shudder.","81":"Home is clearly where the art is for Bacurau director Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho, whose childhood apartment is the locus of the first part of this poetic but somewhat bemused memoir-essay about place, cinema and time. Twice renovated by his historian mother, the apartment was the site of his first early imaginative forays behind the camera, and appeared in his first two features, Neighbouring Sounds from 2012 and, four years later, Aquarius. Mendon\u00e7a\u2019s native city of Recife has also been subject to similar remodellings, as shown in the second and third parts here, through the decline of its cinema houses. As they fall into dereliction, it feels like a form of collective dementia, robbing its citizens of a shared cultural continuity.In Neighbouring Sounds, Mendon\u00e7a has an almost diagrammatic way of shooting his street and continues in the same vein here. Interweaving his family\u2019s history with home-video excerpts and his later feature-film deployments, it\u2019s as if he is trying to fix the essence of the place. Nico, the long-deceased dog next door, is resurrected thanks to clips from Mendon\u00e7a\u2019s debut, in which his incessant barking became part of the plot. Art can be an act of resurrection \u2013 or an exhumation: a bleary inexplicable phantom figure appears in a negative of the director\u2019s living room, though it is not his mother who died aged 54 of cancer. The director\u2019s sleepy voice sifts this flotsam of art and life. \u201cIt may seem like I\u2019m talking about methodology, but I\u2019m talking about love.\u201dMendon\u00e7a\u2019s hauntological mission then spills out into downtown Recife, in search of more ghosts. Now-bare cinema marquees, glimpsed in old photos, are time-stamps for the city. He was educated in these places; we see him talking, in more archive footage, to \u201cMr Alexandre\u201d, the projectionist at the Art Palacio cinema who talks about locking it up on its final night \u201cwith a key of tears\u201d. As well as the director\u2019s own past, these now-decrepit buildings are repositories of the country\u2019s cultural history: the Art Palacio, for example, was once earmarked as an outlet for UFA, the Nazi propaganda cinema arm seeking to tighten its grip on the sympathetic Brazilian regime.The film\u2019s third part focuses on cinema as a site of worship: literally, in the case of several auditoriums later converted into evangelical churches. Mendon\u00e7a is hardly the first to make the comparison and, with the relationship between cinema and religion in Brazil only cursorily sketched here, it is a pat concluding note. The old cinema faith isn\u2019t likely to see a resurrection in Recife, with the city\u2019s dynamism (and presumably the multiplexes) having migrated to other districts, and digital distribution now coordinated from S\u00e3o Paulo. Which leaves Mendon\u00e7a and his film alone inside cinema\u2019s decaying ships \u2013 to use another of his metaphors \u2013 with uncertain bearings in the fogbanks of memory. Pictures of Ghosts is released on 1 December at the ICA, London.","82":"This unabashedly retro war story, set over 24 hours in August 1940, strips the action down to the rivets with a small cast and a handful of locations, including the cockpits of several Spitfire planes (or perhaps one plane used to stand in for several). You\u2019d think it might have cost no more than a tin of biscuits and few packets of tea to make \u2013 except that the aerial photography, never a cheap component, looks authentic and presumably special effects were required to create the dogfights in which our heroic fly-boys duke it out in the skies against the Luftwaffe.Directed by Callum Burn and co-written by him and his father Andrew, it\u2019s of a piece with the previous features from their Lincolnshire production company Tin Hat, specialists in second world war tales of heroism and aerial derring-do. Given the numbers of actual veterans and survivors of the conflict are swiftly dwindling now, you have to wonder how much interest is out there to make this tiny niche in film production profitable. Presumably, there are enough people who yearn for a simpler time when men were men, women wore boilersuits and everyone was pretty much united in one virtuous common cause.The slightly dodgy figure here is Nathan Walker (Vin Hawke, good even if the haircut is more 2020s footballer than 1940s pilot), who is obsessed with winning the betting pool on who can shoot down the most Jerries. His cynicism puts him at odds with his fellow pilots, especially Cochrane (Tom Gordon) and wistful Cooper (Micky David) who wants to survive long enough to marry his sweetheart Nancy (Hannah Harris, rocking the aforementioned boilersuit). In between missions up in the air fighting the enemy, the men relax at the dispatch hut near the runway and banter. The ringing of the telephone becomes a frequent augur of death: after each sortie someone won\u2019t come back, or might land just in time to die accompanied by some sentimental music.One\u2019s lip would have to be stiff as postwar Festival of Britain-era concrete not to find such sacrifices at least a tiny bit moving \u2013 at least the first few times, but it does get a bit monotonous. Still, plaudits to the Tin Hat team for keeping the home fires burning for those who served. Battle Over Britain is released on 1 December in UK cinemas.","83":"Interviewed for this documentary about veterans living with post-traumatic stress disorder, war photographer Lalage Snow talks about her series of triptych portraits of soldiers: three photos, taken before, during and after deployment in Afghanistan. You find yourself searching for the psychological scars written in their tired, thinner faces. In some of the \u201cafter\u201d shots, it\u2019s as if war has completely rewired them. Their features look subtly but noticeably different, muscles in their faces clenched, hardening their expressions \u2013 or somehow making them softer. It\u2019s extraordinary work.Snow says she always wanted to go back, photograph the soldiers a decade after the war, but hasn\u2019t been able to get funding. Instead she talks here in Kate Blewett\u2019s straightforward sympathetic documentary following three veterans living with PTSD (none of them featured in Snow\u2019s work as far we know). One of them is Amber, who enlisted at age 16 after a childhood of domestic violence and sexual abuse. Her emotional rawness and vulnerability are very brave, but almost unbearable to watch in places. Former Royal Marine sniper Stuart is on his second attempt at rowing solo across the Atlantic. He wants to prove that PTSD doesn\u2019t have to hold you back. It\u2019s also a kind of therapy, he says, \u201cTo keep my demons at bay.\u201d Blewett gently asks him how it changed him, being a sniper. He won\u2019t be prodded. \u201cIt\u2019s a job, you get paid to do it.\u201d Which leaves you wondering if there is trauma he doesn\u2019t want to go near.We also meet a former US marine called Ryan, now serving with Vetpaw, a group of veterans protecting wildlife in Africa. People assume they are a bunch of gung-ho, trigger-happy bros, but Ryan says that they\u2019ve all seen enough death to last a lifetime. What Vetpaw gives him back is the \u201cbrotherhood\u201d he had in the marines. Back home in the US he was sick of the pity and questions. \u201cI don\u2019t want to reintegrate into society. Society sucks.\u201d Disorder is released on 28 November on digital platforms.","84":"Adapted from Second Generation, an autobiographical graphic novel (perhaps the genre should be termed \u201cautobiographic novel\u201d?) by Michel Kichka, this animated feature explores the legacy of the Holocaust from a somewhat sideways angle. Kichka\u2019s father Henri was a survivor of Auschwitz, but when the story starts in the late 1950s-early 1960s, Henri is a tamped-down, closed-off character who keeps the office, like his memories, locked up and unshared with his five children. In a pastel-coloured Belgian town, Michel is first met as an adolescent, voiced by Ilan Galkoff although narration by the older Michel (David Baddiel) comments on the action throughout. Barely aware of what happened during the war except that it was something bad dad doesn\u2019t talk about, Michel and younger brother Charley (Skye Bennett) go to synagogue with their family but don\u2019t much think about their Jewish identity except when it gets the young boys out of religious education classes.However, when the 1960 trial of Adolf Eichmann is televised and becomes essential viewing for all the Jewish families in the neighbourhood, Michel and Charley start to take more interest in their father\u2019s story. Somewhat confusingly, he refuses to talk about it with his kids because it is too painful, but out of a sense of duty he becomes a noted speaker on the subject of the Holocaust, appearing on television and guiding visitors around the camps. Meanwhile, Michel becomes more aware of subtle and overt acts of antisemitism all around him, from the teasing of schoolmates to a girlfriend\u2019s father who throws cold water on him when he comes a-courting specifically because he\u2019s Jewish.With its 12 certificate and very simplified graphic style, this feels like it\u2019s intended partly as a pedagogic instrument for kids the same age as those in the film, and inspiration for Holocaust 101 discussions. But it\u2019s still also a story about specific people with their particular family dynamics and unique sufferings, so be prepared for a tragic turn of events towards the end, one that has nothing to do with the larger tragedy that is the Holocaust. It may upset younger viewers but it also makes this film a bit more interesting than the usual baby-boomer-generation, young-Jewish-guy\u2019s coming-of-age story that it looks like on the surface. My Father\u2019s Secrets is released on 27 November on digital platforms.","85":"Earlier this year, Adam Sandler\u2019s high-volume, low-quality Netflix deal gifted us with the surprisingly sensitive coming-of-age comedy You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah, a rare critical win for his company, Happy Madison. It might not have reached the heights of the year\u2019s other big pre-teen adaptation Are You There God, It\u2019s Me Margaret? but it was sweeter and subtler than most expected and became his best-reviewed film to date on Rotten Tomatoes, an interesting use of his sway at the streamer.It might have been focused on middle schoolers but it represented a maturity absent from so many of Sandler\u2019s tiresome films on Netflix, a platform he initially collaborated with because it rhymes with \u201cWet Chicks\u201d. His latest Leo sits comfortably alongside, another classroom-based comedy for an even younger audience, and while Sandler plays a bigger role this time, from dad in the background to protagonist in the fore, we see even less of him on screen. That\u2019s because Leo is an animated lizard, voiced by Sandler, (his second cartoon outing after 2002\u2019s loathed Eight Crazy Nights) a school pet dealing with his own mortality.After Leo starts to worry that at 74, he might be nearing the end, he decides to hatch an escape plan so that he can finally see the world outside of a tank, which he shares with a turtle, voiced by Bill Burr. But when Leo sees a way out, scuttling away during a weekend being looked after by one of the students, he finds himself becoming an unlikely agony uncle instead. Each of the kids he proceeds to stay with needs him in some different way and Leo starts to realise that it might be more important for him to stay rather than go.As Leo, Sandler makes the slightly ill-advised decision to \u201cdo a voice\u201d, something he last did in 2020\u2019s Hubie Halloween, adding an unnecessary, annoying-dad-telling-a-bedtime-story silliness to what\u2019s ultimately a rather earnest little movie. The kids that Leo takes time to counsel have issues varying from an inability to ask questions to being oversensitive to masking anxiety and it\u2019s in these deft two-hander vignettes that the film is most successful, Sandler\u2019s co-written script choosing to take specific problems seriously, life lessons told without a side order of fart jokes. Some of the embellishments surrounding these moments are less successful, the film often unsure how to turn the central conceit into a full story.It\u2019s a sort of musical with a string of half-numbers that range from lazily tossed off to charmingly committed, all of which stop before they really even get started. The last act is a bit of a jumble with a late-stage antagonist and an inevitable quest, a disjointed scramble, but one that climaxes in a worthy reminder for kids to share their problems rather than bottling them up, a not exactly groundbreaking endnote but one that\u2019s expressed genuinely enough for it to register.Brightly animated and with moments of surprising insight, there\u2019s a warm likability to Leo that radiates, for those still in the classroom and those who left it long ago.Leo is now available on Netflix","86":"Screenwriter Richard Curtis is a cinema colossus with nothing left to prove: he reinvented the romcom with transatlantic classics like Four Weddings, Notting Hill and The Tall Guy; he re-energised charitable giving with Comic Relief; and even those of us who never signed up to Love Actually concede the dark power of the Emma Thompson-crying scene. But we really do not need this new Christmas film from him (he writes, Sam Boyd directs), an unremittingly awful, bafflingly terrible and defanged bit of seasonal gibberish: a fantasy comedy which forgets to put in gags and which cheats its own narrative rules. Watching it is like trailing around a year-round Christmas market in March.Paapa Essiedu plays a chap with the quirky name of Bernard Bottle, employed in New York (cue Christmassy shots of people skating in Rockefeller Plaza) as an assistant in a very posh art auction house, run by a heartless meanie called Flaxman (Alan Cumming). Flaxman declines to let poor Bernard go home at knocking-off time to attend his daughter\u2019s birthday \u2013 very close to Christmas incidentally \u2013 and loads more work on him. Bernard timidly submits.But Bernard is not exactly a Bob Cratchit figure and he certainly doesn\u2019t have Cratchit\u2019s money worries. He, wife Julie (Den\u00e9e Benton) and daughter Eve (Jordyn McIntosh) live in a handsome New York apartment and Julie\u2019s family is apparently loaded. But Julie is furious with him for missing Eve\u2019s birthday, and she takes their daughter and leaves. Poor Bernard miserably looks at the dusty old jewellery box that he\u2019s had for ages (and which he unconvincingly tried to give Eve as a last-minute present), idly polishes it and \u2013 whoosh! \u2013 a wacky genie comes out, played by Melissa McCarthy.This genie can grant any number of wishes, but she has to hear the instructions clearly; she can\u2019t change people\u2019s basic feelings and she can\u2019t take you back in time. So \u2026 can she pull off the Christmas miracle of saving Bernard\u2019s marriage? Well, no one minds a bit of predictable cheesiness, but McCarthy is just so completely subdued in this film and is never allowed to let rip. It\u2019s as if everyone involved is terrified of actually making people laugh in case that gives offence somehow, or disrupts the algorithmic calculation that theoretically makes this a palatable piece of content. The whole thing is as bland as cellophane. Genie is released on 22 November on Peacock in the US and on 1 December on Sky Cinema and Now in the UK.","87":"It\u2019s the final of the 2022 World Snooker Championships, and a TV pundit is showering compliments on Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan, who\u2019s back in his stride after losing a couple of frames to Judd Trump. \u201cHe just looks so relaxed, so cool,\u201d marvels the pundit. Behind the scenes, we\u2019ve just watched O\u2019Sullivan nervy, on the edge of a meltdown, and venting at his psychiatrist, Prof Steve Peters. \u201cFuck me, I feel bashed up Steve,\u201d he says. It\u2019s one of the biggest games of O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s career; if he wins, he\u2019ll have seven world crowns \u2013 equalling Stephen Hendry\u2019s modern-era record. At 46, who knows how many finals he\u2019s got left in him? As history records, O\u2019Sullivan did get past Trump, by 18 frames to 13.If you\u2019re watching this entertaining documentary utterly unbothered about whether or not he is snooker\u2019s greatest player (\u201che\u2019s an artist\u201d says Hendry), the good news is that O\u2019Sullivan is brilliant company. He\u2019s got the gift of the gab, a sense of humour and he\u2019s relaxed with his vulnerability: talkative about his addictions and mental health struggles. Nattering away to director Sam Blair, he comes over as an all-round nice bloke. Significantly, perhaps, the film is exec produced by another Essex boy, David Beckham.O\u2019Sullivan says he fell in love with snooker early. He had bundles of talent and was pushed to be a champion by his larger-than-life dad Ronnie Senior. \u201cI needed that, or I would have been a loser,\u201d says O\u2019Sullivan. In 1992, the year he turned professional, Ronnie Senior was jailed for murder. In his 20s, O\u2019Sullivan spiralled into drug addiction; his old mate Damien Hirst remembers getting a call to take him to the Priory. Nowadays, O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s fix is a good scone with clotted cream: \u201cIt\u2019s got to be M&S.\u201dI\u2019m not sure a two-hour film is long enough to unpick his tortured relationship with snooker (he\u2019s been with psychiatrist Peters for 10 years). As a young player there were moments when he felt invincible. He\u2019s still chasing that high. The healthiest thing would be to give up, O\u2019Sullivan reflects. \u201cBut I\u2019ve found a way of it not killing me.\u201d Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan: The Edge of Everything is released on 23 November on Prime Video, and on 24 November in UK and Irish cinemas.","88":"It\u2019s the junkiest time of the year for streamers, churning out cheap Christmas films that are so tinnily made and carelessly written that enduring them requires more seasonal spirit than even Buddy the Elf could even muster. Will Ferrell\u2019s comedy turns 20 this year, along with Love Actually and Bad Santa, and all recall an unusually magic time for the festive film, each in their different ways earning an easy rewatch slot when November kicks in.It\u2019s obviously, stupidly unfair to compare any of Netflix\u2019s many many low-stakes films of the season to those beloved standouts, but while Best. Christmas. Ever! was never intended to be quite as good, it really doesn\u2019t need to be quite this bad. Shoddy seasonal slop had been previously siloed on Hallmark and Lifetime channels, for those who had become accustomed to reduced standards all year round, but Netflix has enthusiastically got in on the game too, and while its brand has lost considerable lustre in recent years, it\u2019s still the same platform that attracts small and big screen auteurs with a vision. Nestled next to the new David Fincher, again expectations would not be as high for a comedy headlined by Heather Graham, but it\u2019s easy to forget throughout the rest of the year just how lackadaisical and low-rent these films can be, lofty comparison or no, from script to direction to performances. Arguably the most important role in these films is set dresser, jamming every scene with enough decorations to distract from the listlessness elsewhere, but no amount of tinsel can disguise how boringly tossed off this one is, a bleak reminder of what\u2019s in store for the next six weeks.At less than 80 minutes, it\u2019s barely even a movie, more one long montage of bits that never run on long enough to be defined as scenes. Strange given that the film boasts a more interesting pedigree than usual with a script co-written by Charles Shyer, whose words helped to define studio comedies for a while with Private Benjamin, Father of the Bride, Baby Boom and The Parent Trap. Any of that wit or even basic competency is nowhere to be seen here, aimlessly telling the story of two old friends who are reunited during the holidays.One is a tireless success story (Brandy Norwood) and the other is a self-defined failure (Graham), the former\u2019s braggy Christmas newsletters causing the latter to feel inadequate as well as suspicious. When an absurd set of circumstances forces them to spend Christmas together, their rivalry comes to a head.It\u2019s a premise that suggests something as salty as it is sweet but the film, directed by Pet Sematary\u2019s Mary Lambert, is as wet as a pile of melting snow, refusing to indulge in any fun cattiness, transforming the pitch for a dark comedy into a sickly family movie, overstuffed with inane life lessons and cloying kids. Something with more of a bite would have allowed our two leads to have a bit more fun but they\u2019re both stuck in sleepwalk mode, a particularly bored Graham struggling to add a much-needed lightness to her comedic scenes. It\u2019s so unclear as to what kind of friendship these two once had (they barely share any scenes alone together) and instead of filling in any of the gaps, the script lazily tries to create vague conflict out of romantic jealousy instead, involving their husbands (including Jason Biggs, lost) when the film should have focused more tightly on the women.In the last act, the absurd details of the plot become so deranged that the film almost hobbles into so-bad-it\u2019s-good territory with the pair heading for disaster on an out-of-control solar-powered hot air balloon that could be saved by Graham\u2019s underused skills as a failed inventor, whose main flop idea was \u201cchip mitts\u201d that protect hands from Cheetos dust. But it\u2019s too insane too late and not insane enough to forgive the flatness that\u2019s come before.It might be the year\u2019s first Netflix Christmas film to come barreling out of the production line but it\u2019s hard to imagine it getting any worse.Sign up to The GuideGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every Fridayafter newsletter promotionBest. Christmas. Ever! is now available on Netflix","89":"As Yoko Ono enters her 90s, it is perhaps a tactless time to release a documentary about the woman with whom John Lennon had a love affair during a rough patch in his marriage from about 1973 to 1975, what he ungallantly called his \u201clost weekend\u201d. This is the couple\u2019s then assistant, the extremely smart Chinese-American May Pang, in her early 20s at the time, who emerges with grace and dignity from this engrossing film. The Apple Records A&R man and LA music eminence grise Tony King is quoted here saying of Pang: \u201cShe wasn\u2019t just a little scrubber \u2026\u201d That Withnailesque phrase hardly does justice to an intelligent, beautiful and sweet-natured woman who gave unquestioning love to Lennon and appeared to single-handedly repair his relationship with his son Julian.It seems to have been a real love match, but founded on a strange, dysfunctional situation: Ono herself, by her own cautious admission, encouraged the liaison as a way of managing and controlling what she saw as Lennon\u2019s increasing tendency to stray. Ono virtually ordered Pang to \u201cdate\u201d Lennon and the resulting semi-official coupledom coincided with a poignant flowering of creativity and relaxation in Lennon\u2019s life, both in LA where he and Pang briefly hung out, and back in New York. But Ono was always there in the background, perhaps in more direct contact with Lennon than Pang quite realised or this film acknowledges.Finally, it was Ono herself who called time on the liaison and Lennon sheepishly informed the heartbroken May that he was going back to live with Ono in their home in the Dakota building, outside which he would five years later meet his terrible fate. This documentary fortunately refrains from making glib comparisons between Ono breaking up this affair to the way some saw her as breaking up the Beatles, but the film (based on Pang\u2019s two previous books on the subject, and using the resulting TV interview footage) is implicitly critical of both Ono and Lennon and their self-absorption. A sterner commentary might have called their attitude abusive. At all events, it is a vivid snapshot of a troubled private life at the apex of the US music scene. The Lost Weekend: A Love Story is released on 20 November on the Icon Film Channel and on 18 December on DVD, Blu-ray and digital platforms.","90":"Eli Roth has long worked to collapse the distance between cinema\u2019s mainstream and its grungiest fringes, smuggling determinedly low-rent genres \u2013 mostly splatter horror, the odd shameless erotic thriller, the globetrotting safari of third-world depravity known as the mondo film \u2013 into your neighborhood multiplex. He did so most literally with his contribution to Grindhouse, a 2007 double feature from the sleaze connoisseurs Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez styled to evoke the gutbucket treasures of yore, complete with faux-retro scratches and interstitial trailers for nonexistent coming attractions. Roth directed one such short, a spot for a Z-grade slasher that loosed a killer in a pilgrim get-up on the town of Plymouth to slice up their annual Turkey Day parade. \u201cWhite meat. Dark meat. All will be carved,\u201d went the tagline\u2019s warning, the voiceover basted with an affectionate irony.In fully realizing his gravy-drenched gorefest Thanksgiving, Roth tempts fate by expanding a joke perfectly portioned at two minutes to feature length, which got old sooner rather than later when tried on fellow Grindhouse alumni Machete and Hobo with a Shotgun. He does away with the throwback aesthetics, a visual tidying-up that matches the image quality to its present-day setting of Instagram live streams and land acknowledgments. And within an amply earned R rating, a couple of concessions needed to be made; a vaginal impalement from the original trailer has been relocated to a more tasteful part of the body, and an immaculately roasted nude human corpse with stuffing bursting from its pelvic cavity now wears clothes. But Roth has nonetheless held fast to the demented playfulness of classic exploitation in a stick-to-your-ribs feast of ascended schlock. Never mind all the talk of poultry, he\u2019s dishing up red goddamned meat: prime-certified laughs and mutilations, no fillers or additives.Surely to the great frustration of the many DIY deviants following his example, there\u2019s no substitute for Roth\u2019s nuts-and-bolts skill as an orchestrator of tension and humor, which lays a finely honed foundation for his wicked games. In the exhilarating prologue, a coiled sense of foreboding tightens and explodes as a stampede of Black Friday shoppers storm a Walmart knockoff and claim three lives in the chaos. A clever inversion of Dawn of the Dead\u2019s mall invasion recasting the zombies as consumers, it\u2019s an unsubtle yet chillingly plausible remark on our grotesque capitalist distortion of a holiday that, as one teacher points out, began with America\u2019s genocidal original sin. Roth shoots the crowd like the rabid rioters that form after Bostonians win or lose a major sporting event \u2013 among its plentiful virtues, this is one of the finest and truest films ever made about the people of Massachusetts \u2013 but lingers on a \u201cDoorbuster Sale\u201d sign as a reminder that businesses stoke and profit from such behavior. Roth reduced human lives to dollars and cents with the soulless auctions of the second Hostel film; here, they\u2019re 50% off, as declared by a banner forming a delectably morbid pun with a woman\u2019s bisected carcass.Roth thinks in hooks and punchlines, which keeps the copious slayings inventive and gratifying while also enlivening the connective tissue between them. One year after the massacre, the buckle-hatted maniac \u2013 hidden behind a mask of the Plymouth colony governor John Carver like a seasonal kitsch Michael Myers \u2013 starts picking off those visible in a viral recording taken that night, targeting the store owner\u2019s teen daughter Jessica (Nell Verlaque) and her buddies (most notable among them the social media personality Addison Rae, a gen Z \u201cParis Hilton in House of Wax\u201d without the grisly payoff). Despite the valiant efforts of the town sheriff (the Maine native Patrick Dempsey, dropping his Rs like so many lobster traps into the icy Atlantic), one local after the next becomes part of the ghastly place-setting at a dinner where the menu includes decapitation, disembowelment and forced cannibalism. As with any good meal, timing is everything, and there\u2019s no lollygagging or self-serious ponderousness to forestall the fun. Even a tacked-on subplot concerning two boys dueling for Jessica\u2019s affections has the decency to poke fun at its own extraneousness.The table\u2019s tableau echoes The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\u2019s previous perversion of wholesome Rockwelliana, its emphasis on family and togetherness turned incestuous and rageful. Roth\u2019s reference points aren\u2019t particularly obscure, but he earns the right to claim them through his proud commitment to horror for horror\u2019s sake, a balm at a time when it feels like every other entry to the genre is buckling beneath the weight of its belabored trauma metaphors. He applies discipline to the disreputable, elevating choice cuts of trash not with put-on profundity but with a keener mastery of and appreciation for their foulest, basest pleasures. What more do we need to give thanks for?Thanksgiving is out in UK and US cinemas on 17 November","91":"Not even the fierce wattage of Toni Collette\u2019s talent can light up this hokey crime comedy, a kind of wacky mobster spin on the idea of the unhappy American woman finding herself and learning to love again in a luxury Euro-tourist paradise; Mafia Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again, perhaps. It\u2019s directed by Catherine Hardwicke from a story idea by French author and film-maker Amanda Sthers, who gave us Madame \u2013 another film into which Collette tried valiantly but unsuccessfully to breathe some life.Here she plays Kristin, an empty-nester whose son has just gone away to college; she is bored and unfulfilled by her job as a big pharma PR, and her husband turns out to be a cheating slimeball. Then she receives news that her Italian grandfather has just died on his Lazio estate bequeathing her full control of his \u201cwinery\u201d business. Intrigued and in need of a change of scene, Kristin hops on the next flight to Italy and even at the airport has a flirtatious encounter with a hunky pasta-maker called Lorenzo (Guilio Corso). But when a shootout breaks out at her grandfather\u2019s funeral, Kristin learns the awful truth: she has inherited a crime family.Collette\u2019s gift for comedy is always welcome and she sells this movie very hard, like the impeccable professional she is, and it\u2019s a nice enough premise for an undemanding comedy. But frankly Collette is let down by Monica Bellucci\u2019s very torpid and disengaged performance as her late grandfather\u2019s mysterious private secretary, and the woman who looks as if she has been the one really pulling the strings. Bellucci looks as if she is thinking about something else in every scene. It isn\u2019t long before you\u2019re doing the same. Mafia Mamma is released on 17 November on Prime Video.","92":"The framework of a marriage \u2013 the shared past, the certainties, even the love itself \u2013 is put under unimaginable strain when one half of it, former journalist and broadcaster Augusto G\u00f3ngora, is diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. This tender, profoundly moving Chilean documentary is an intimate study of the strategies that G\u00f3ngora and his wife, the actor and politician Paulina Urrutia, put in place to cope with the attrition of his memories. With warmth and patience, Paulina painstakingly walks her husband through the increasingly tangled mental maze of his past, signposting key moments and facts for him to cling to: his achievements as a reporter; his wide circle of friends and family (\u201cThey love me very much,\u201d he repeats like a mantra, in an attempt to stave off the clouds of confusion).The latest film from Chilean director Maite Alberdi (Oscar-nominated for her previous documentary, The Mole Agent), The Eternal Memory is a restrained, respectful piece of film-making that takes its lead from its two subjects. It\u2019s wrenchingly sad, but also a testament to the love that endures, even as Augusto increasingly struggles to recognise his wife.","93":"To fully understand a marriage you need to be a part of it. And even then it can seem as if the two partners are communicating in entirely different languages. This is literally the case in the marriage of successful German-born author Sandra (a phenomenal Sandra H\u00fcller) and her French husband, aspiring writer Samuel (Samuel Theis), a union that is forensically and microscopically examined in Justine Triet\u2019s gripping, sinuous, Cannes Palme d\u2019Or-winning courtroom drama Anatomy of a Fall. Language \u2013 Sandra prefers to speak in English even though, at her husband\u2019s behest, they live in France \u2013 is just one of the flashpoints for tension between the two.These tensions might have just simmered on privately and indefinitely, within the walls of the couple\u2019s partially renovated alpine chalet, but for the fact that Samuel is found dead, discovered by the couple\u2019s visually impaired 11-year-old son, Daniel (a terrific, painfully conflicted turn from talented young actor Milo Machado Graner), having fallen from the attic window. An inconclusive inquest into the death can\u2019t rule out the possibility that he was pushed. And so Sandra finds herself on trial, with her child called as one of the key witnesses in the case. The flaws and faultlines in her relationship with Samuel are exposed and picked over by a tenacious prosecution lawyer (Antoine Reinartz) and repackaged as evidence for her guilt.Perhaps more than most genres, the courtroom drama succeeds or fails on the strength of its screenplay. And here, with its layered and rewardingly intricate script co-written by Triet and her husband, Arthur Harari, this solid, unshowy film excels. Nodding to courtroom dramas such as Kramer vs Kramer and Otto Preminger\u2019s Anatomy of a Murder (an inspiration in more than just title), and to the more recent example of Alice Diop\u2019s compelling Saint Omer, it\u2019s a slippery thing, a teasingly complex framework that repeatedly tips the audience off balance and taps into our biases and assumptions.A genre that can be prone to stuffiness and overly waffly dialogue, the courtroom drama here is electric, restlessly dynamic and compulsively watchable, with only a few rare moments in which the film\u2019s throttling hold on the audience loosens. It\u2019s a considerable step up for Triet, whose previous work includes the frothy, more overtly comic In Bed With Victoria and the uneven character study Sibyl.Marriage, the film suggests, is like a mosaic. One or two highly coloured tiles might catch the eye but they can\u2019t, on their own, show the whole picture. The reports we get of Sandra and Samuel\u2019s life together (there is only one flashback in the film; most of what we learn comes from the evidence presented in the court) suggest a relationship that gets chillier and spikier by the minute. But then the prosecution\u2019s case relies on cherrypicking the trauma and the deep-seated unhappiness in the marriage, and foregrounding the character traits in Sandra that might make her capable of murder. A choice of other, sunnier moments, as Sandra reasonably points out, would paint an entirely different picture of her relationship with her husband.Even with that in mind, however, there\u2019s plenty of ammunition for the prosecution. As with Saint Omer, it\u2019s more than just a woman on trial here. Just as Diop\u2019s drama wove into its court case an examination of race, class and the status of the female migrant in French society, so Triet seeds the film with questions about divisions of labour, about the role of the wife within marriage and about society\u2019s profound discomfort around a woman who not only takes what she wants from life, but refuses to apologise for it.The fact that Sandra prioritises her career over her share of the childcare, cannibalises her own life and those of others for her writing (a theme that links back to Triet\u2019s previous film, Sibyl) and unashamedly admits to having bisexual relationships during her marriage doesn\u2019t make her guilty of murder. But neither does it conform to the role of victimhood that the accused woman is expected to play. Triet further supports this perception by frequently placing the camera slightly below Sandra \u2013 subliminally suggesting that she is a powerful, dominating, even threatening presence \u2013 rather than above her, looking down.Did she do it? It\u2019s worth mentioning that when H\u00fcller asked the director this question, Triet refused to say, claiming that she herself didn\u2019t know the answer. Ultimately, one of the key pleasures of the picture is its uncertainty \u2013 the niggling doubts that remain, and the sense that a crucial piece of the puzzle is tantalisingly out of reach. This article was amended on 22 November 2023 because an earlier version referred to Sandra and Daniel\u2019 s life together, when it was Sandra and Samuel\u2019s life together which was meant.","94":"University professor Paul Matthews (Nicolas Cage) is an easy man to ignore. A deliciously peevish performance from Cage paints a character who wears his grievances as stubbornly as the anorak that rarely leaves his back. With his fretfully twitching upper lip and a whining inflection that turns everything he says \u2013 even his own name \u2013 into a pissy, worming complaint, Paul exists in permanent umbrage.Everything changes, however, when he starts to turn up, initially as a lurking, inscrutable onlooker, in the dreams of strangers. So widespread is this inexplicable phenomenon that Paul starts to enjoy a viral celebrity, a newfound fame that he embraces, toothily and gracelessly, as something that he clearly feels was his due all along. His students finally start to pay attention in class. He is courted by a slick marketing hotshot (Michael Cera). He even finds himself the subject of erotic interest, resulting in a sex scene so mortifying you\u2019ll want to scrape it from your memory with a penknife. And then, just as suddenly, the collective unconscious shifts. Dream Paul goes from a benign to malign presence, from passive to horribly, threateningly active. And the public reaction to real Paul skews accordingly.The follow-up to the brutal satire Sick of Myself from Norwegian director Kristoffer Borgli, Dream Scenario further mines the director\u2019s fascination with fame \u2013 the cost of it, the fickle nature of it, the indignities of it. It\u2019s a savagely funny showcase for Cage at his very best. But the picture sours somewhat in a third act that departs from crisp character study to target cancel culture, losing some of its biting humour in the process.","95":"In 1997, John Wagner and Vince Locke published their superb graphic novel A History of Violence: it was the story of an apparently regular guy, a small town Michigan cafe owner, whose unexpectedly accomplished defence of his family during an attempted robbery hints at a dark past which eventually turns out to involve mob entanglements. In 2005, David Cronenberg adapted the novel into the splendid Viggo Mortensen vehicle of the same name, which \u2013 Aragorn aside \u2013 may represent Mortensen\u2019s finest hour. Now, this new Tamil version has broken several box office records and, at two hours 40 minutes runtime, has plenty of scope to expand on its source material \u2013 especially in the 18-certificate \u201cuncut\u201d version which has just entered cinemas.The film opens with the small town of Theog in the snowbound western Himalayas which is under attack by a feisty CGI hyena that has managed to get into the local school playground. One man steps forward: local cafe owner Parthiban (mononymic star Vijay), and handily bests the slavering beast. The hyena shenanigans, however, do not replace but merely precede the badass cafe robbery triumph.But please don\u2019t ask why anyone would be shocked that a man who can take down a rampaging out-of-control hyena in hand-to-claw combat can also face down a few human robbers \u2013 it simply isn\u2019t that kind of story-world. The incident with the hyena is there to signal that you are entering a world of spectacle, of non-stop set-pieces and ever-more climactic showdowns. Leave your irrelevant thoughts about logic at the door and instead enjoy some physically impossible car chases, bone-crunching fight scenes and hundreds of mobsters singing and dancing in unison, all set to one of the silliest and most pleasurable soundtracks this side of Paul Oakenfold\u2019s splendid work on Swordfish.Directed with verve and enthusiasm by 37-year-old former bank employee Lokesh Kanagaraj, who moved into directing after winning a short film competition, the influence of the likes of Quentin Tarantino on all of this is very much evident. Indeed, like Tarantino, Kanagaraj has announced his intention to quit directing after completing 10 films. On this evidence, Kanagaraj\u2019s retirement so soon would be a shame. Leo: Bloody Sweet is out now in cinemas.","96":"\u2018There are a lot of things to dislike in this world. Nazis. Modern art. Vegans. But above all I despise vampires.\u201d That\u2019s Dolph Lundgren in a growl, wearing a ludicrous wig, and karate-kicking his way through a horde of undead. Lundgren plays ageing action star Claude Luc Hallyday, a veteran of trashy films with trashier titles (Moses v the Nazis!). It\u2019s a supporting role but Lundgren is the main attraction in Orson Oblowitz\u2019s misty-eyed, sentimental, sometimes silly love letter to cinema. The setting is a gorgeous movie palace where the owner has a thing for tough guy Hallyday, watching his 80s action flicks on repeat \u2013 funny pastiche clips shot here as little movies-in-a-movie.To be fair, Terrence Howard is also pretty terrific as cinema proprietor George, whose family have owned the Grand since it opened in the 1920s. George grew up in the cinema, and Howard plays him as a man who\u2019s never fully signed up to the outside world, dressed like a cowboy in a long leather duster coat, and speaking in a faintly grandiose way like a character from a classic movie. His problems begin when a corporate developer Lynn (Amanda Righetti) sets her sights on his cinema, planning to bulldoze it to make way for gleaming luxury apartments.Here\u2019s where the film gets a bit daft as Lynn dispatches her goons to make George sign on the dotted line. But George has hired his hero Hallyday \u2013 living as a recluse in Estonia \u2013 for a sell-out guest appearance. Lundgren is a good sport as the washed up action star, mumbling and barely coherent, and possibly channelling Ozzy Osbourne. It makes for some fun moments and a funny showdown with the baddies. In the old days this would probably have gone straight to tape, so straight-to-download feels like the right place. Showdown at the Grand is released on 13 November on digital platforms.","97":"Switzerland\u2019s strange postwar burden of quasi-collaborator-guilt, with all its symptoms of evasion and denial, is the theme of this intimately presented black-and-white movie from writer-director Laurent N\u00e8gre. It is inspired by the real-life case of Hans Fr\u00f6licher, the Swiss ambassador to Nazi Germany from 1938 to the end of the war, much approved of by the Nazi elite due to his submissive pro-German loyalty. It is also a free adaptation of The Envoy, Thomas H\u00fcrlimann\u2019s stage-play on the same subject.Michael Neuenschwander plays the ambassador, here fictionalised as Heinrich Zwygart; he returns to Switzerland and his handsome family estate in 1945, a haggard and haunted figure with a drink problem, yet outwardly fiercely correct as befits a Swiss public figure and civil servant. Sensing that he might be made the scapegoat for Switzerland\u2019s embarrassment, he has a new plan to prove his enduring patriotism by being as sycophantic to the Americans as he was to the Germans.As for his fellow Swiss, Zwygart finds them blandly relieved that their picturesque cuckoo-clock paradise of neutrality is unscathed. Zwygart\u2019s cantankerous old-soldier father (Peter Wyssbrod) still stoutly proclaims the fiction that Hitler was deterred from invading Switzerland after the fall of France because of the swift mobilisation and continuous battle-readiness of the Swiss army. Zwygart is not-so-secretly contemptuous of Switzerland\u2019s \u201ctoy soldiers\u201d and has another theory: Hitler stayed out of Switzerland because Switzerland became the Germans\u2019 discreet banker, the concierge state which facilitated cheap or gratis loans to aid the Nazi war effort, and was a useful financial friend to the party from well before the war.Zwygart was at the centre of this, and conspicuously declined to plead for a pardon in the case of Maurice Bavaud, a Swiss student who attempted to assassinate Hitler in 1938 and was executed; also a real case. But now Zwygart has hallucinatory visions of this would-be killer, the one Swiss who really was on the right side of history. This is a watchable, if somewhat stagey film, and these jump-scare visions, leaping out of the ambassador\u2019s tormented subconscious, might have worked better in the theatre. A Forgotten Man is released on 10 November in UK cinemas.","98":"Like large-scale tattoos, colourful murals and graffiti adorn the urban body of Belo Horizonte, a densely populated city in southeastern Brazil. Composed largely of static shots, Marcos Pimentel\u2019s poignant documentary conjures an awe-striking tapestry of artistic expression and revolutionary resistance.Imposing in terms of size, these sprawling street artworks range from kaleidoscopic portraits to fabulously surreal tableaux vivants. For some passersby, these majestic images amount to nothing more than a cool selfie backdrop. Pimentel\u2019s film, however, takes a closer look, lingering on painted words that speak of a yearning for love and intimacy. These utterances of private desire exist side by side with protest slogans calling for Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s resignation and condemning the police. Weaving together the personal and political, Pimentel\u2019s film sees street art as a crucial form of political advocacy at a time when dissenting voices are cruelly repressed.Echoing this collective desire for change, the film\u2019s ambient soundtrack gradually gives way to the sounds of anti-Bolsonaro demonstrations, whose ferocious chants encircle the cityscape like a wake up call. Shouts demanding justice for Marielle Franco, a Brazilian city councillor assassinated for her outspoken views, are accompanied by moving murals paying tribute to her legacy.In addition to their potency as a conduit of creative and political thoughts, the artworks also become a means of cultural archive, bearing witness to state-sanctioned violence, wealth inequality, and brutal acts of oppression. Shot during Bolsonaro\u2019s administration, the final scene of graffiti walls being knocked down may feel like an ominous display of destruction; however, considering the 2022 election in which Bolsonaro was unseated by Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, the imagery gains a newfound optimism, gesturing towards a nation\u2019s hopeful rebirth. Skin is available from 10 November on True Story.","99":"Gabriel Byrne stars as two versions of Samuel Beckett in a film that places the Irish novelist and dramatist in conversation with himself, looking back and unpicking a lifetime\u2019s tangle of love and guilt. It\u2019s a device that aspires to be Beckettian but feels synthetic and contrived \u2013 something that is not helped by the pristine look of the picture. The crisp, clean cinematography is certainly striking, but seems a little prissy, disengaging Dance First from the earth and passion and the unpredictable spirit of Beckett\u2019s writing. But Byrne is rather good in the role, his rueful, craggy face a battleground for a war between Beckett\u2019s self-regard and his self-loathing.","100":"John Williams\u2019s punishing 1960 western novel Butcher\u2019s Crossing was described by Bret Easton Ellis as \u201ca precursor to what Cormac McCarthy would do with the genre\u201d. It follows Will Andrews, a dreamy 23-year-old Harvard dropout, as he tags along with Miller, a buffalo hunter targeting hidden valleys in the Colorado territory in the late 19th century. Will hopes to learn \u201cmore about this country\u201d; what he gets, as the four-man crew shoots and hacks its way through dwindling herds in ever more treacherous conditions, is a lesson in remorseless brutality. Any screen version would need to find a cinematic equivalent for the prose\u2019s tensile strength, and for what critic Leo Robson calls the \u201cregime of methodical close description\u201d from which Williams offers no respite. In this shallow, corner-cutting adaptation, the director and co-writer Gabe Polsky doesn\u2019t come close.At least he has the casting down pat. The film is well served by Fred Hechinger, one of the cherubic stars of the first season of The White Lotus, who rightly makes us fear for Andrews; ambling off into the wilderness, he looks as out of his depth as a Smurf in Picasso\u2019s Guernica. Nicolas Cage has ample room to kick off as the bearded, bullet-headed Miller, but in fact remains for the most part subdued. One of his wackier moments, when he squats in the moonlit snow drawing an open razor repeatedly across his own bald scalp, is also the movie\u2019s eeriest, its effect weakened only by the antiseptic studio environment.No matter how nasty things get, the screen stays spick-and-span; clothes appear pressed, skin exfoliated. Even after months in the wild, there is no sense that anyone pongs, the way they do in, say, Kelly Reichardt\u2019s First Cow and Meek\u2019s Cutoff. Grisly sights are paraded before the camera (including a castrated hunter and untold bison gore) but Polsky lacks the visual flair to make the shocks visceral or the suffering anything more than superficial. Data-heavy end titles decrying the plundering of nature suggest that we\u2019ve been watching an environmental polemic all along. More proof that the film doesn\u2019t really know what it is or who it\u2019s for. Butcher\u2019s Crossing is released on 1 November on Prime Video.","101":"There is a numbing sameness about the many documentaries out there about historical trauma, whether they are telling stories of casualties of war, survivors of abuse, or the descendants of either. Exercises in oral and visual history, these films follow strong narrative conventions, perhaps modelled on criminal trials: opening arguments, methodical presentation of evidence, climaxing with quavering testimony from victims.To be frank, Margo Harkin\u2019s documentary reviewing the horrors of Ireland\u2019s mother-and-baby institutions \u2013 essentially state- and church-run factories churning out children for adoption, shame and misery \u2013 doesn\u2019t swerve far from the template outlined above. But to extend the legal metaphor, she assembles the arguments with the skill of a high-court prosecutor. With forensic precision, it starts with the wider view of how a patriarchal theological obsession with controlling women\u2019s bodies, along with the political context, allowed \u201cindustrial\u201d schools, Magdalene laundries and mother-and-baby homes to flourish. Run often by nuns who lived in comfort upstairs while the \u201cgirls\u201d \u2013 unmarried mothers sent away to give birth in secrecy \u2013 lived in squalor in the basement, these so-called homes have only recently had their horrors revealed. The opening story is, of course, the 796 infants and children who died at Bon Secours mother and baby home in Tuam, Galway, and were buried in pits discovered only when the land was being repurposed for development.The focus, and the horror, spreads from there, as Harkin expands by interviewing journalists, politicians, legal scholars and historians, but also poets such as Jessica Traynor, who read pieces about the pain of such places in the ruins that remain. We hear from sons and daughters who lived with mothers that survived these homes and are still searching for siblings who remain unaccounted for, and of course many survivors themselves.While the latter\u2019s stories are as chilling and nauseating as it gets, it\u2019s notable how few tears or raised voices there are. Instead, these women \u2013 and it\u2019s mostly women we meet \u2013 tell their stories with clenched, clear voices, still seething with rage but rehearsed down into ritual. The big emoting goes on in composer Deirdre Gribbin\u2019s string-heavy score that\u2019s powerfully melancholy but just astringent enough to keep things in check. Altogether, this is a nearly immaculate, exemplary piece of documentary film-making. Stolen is released on 3 November in UK and Ireland in cinemas.","102":"If you\u2019ve ever wondered what a Hallmark Christmas movie would look like if you got rid of the former Disney child stars, glossy production locations and Dolly Parton showing up at the end to sing a festive ballad, here we have an answer. This is a British micro-budget answer to holiday themed films such as Falling for Christmas, A Cozy Christmas Inn or A Christmas Cookie Catastrophe \u2013 all of which emerged in the last year.The film-makers of this one clearly know the template like the backs of their hands, with the following Christmas romcom tropes present and correct: a wholesome but struggling business enterprise (see title), a trip back home for Christmas (see title), the magic of small communities compared with big cities (guess where the Holly Day Inn is located), a random meet-cute (a roadside tyre-change), the potential change of career (female lead is initially a London-based workaholic), the romantic B-plot involving an older couple (hello, Colin Baker and Anita Dobson), the importance of the spirit of Christmas (passim), the baddie who wants to close the local business (guess who the male lead works for), the big misunderstanding (male lead is mistaken for travel journalist) and of course a cute dog (Mr Jingles). Obviously it\u2019s not original, and that\u2019s the whole point: the idea is to enjoy a warm brew of cliches as comforting as a gingerbread latte on a frosty night.It probably does bear mentioning that there are Christmas pantos around the UK every year with considerably more money to throw around than this film \u2013 and as a result, it has the faint sense of one of those unfortunate Winter Wonderland attractions: people shell out \u00a3100 to get in, only to realise that the entire thing takes place in the back of a pub car park, Rudolph is made of cardboard and the fairy lights are all from Poundland. But it would be a shame to be too Scrooge-like about this: Christmas at the Holly Day Inn was evidently made with an enormous amount of affection for the genre, and certainly gets a big shiny Christmas star for effort. Christmas at the Holly Day Inn is released on 6 November on digital platforms.","103":"\u2018Have you guys seen Jason Bourne?\u201d asks Brian (Andrew Still), a farm labourer in the Outer Hebrides, near the start of Nobody Has to Know. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly the same kind of set-up!\u201d How droll of the writer-director Bouli Lanners to invoke that breakneck action franchise when his own film could scarcely be more different, save for a plot involving memory loss. The closest thing here to an action set-piece occurs when an estate agent is tardy returning to the office, leaving her colleague to take a later-than-usual lunch break.If this isn\u2019t a film to set the heart racing, it doesn\u2019t leave that organ entirely untroubled; with his script\u2019s echoes of 40s weepie Random Harvest, Lanners is aiming for similar status. The Bourne-lite hero is Brian\u2019s Belgian co-worker Phil (Lanners), who suffers a stroke. Only a mild, photogenic one, mind you, with no paralysis or facial palsy, just a spot of temporary amnesia manifested in purely whimsical terms; he can\u2019t recall, for instance, how a dalmatian named Nigel ended up in his house. This blank slate also makes it possible for the emotionally frigid Millie (Michelle Fairley), daughter of Phil\u2019s boss, Angus (Julian Glover), to pull a While You Were Sleeping-style fast one on him by pretending they were in a relationship. \u201cAre we still together?\u201d he asks, dazed yet hopeful.The British Board of Film Classification lists this \u201csexual coercion\u201d among the reasons for the film\u2019s 12A rating, but Lanners neutralises potential tastelessness by ensuring that any possible area of conflict \u2013 be it the provenance of Nigel, or Phil\u2019s eventual discovery of Millie\u2019s subterfuge \u2013 is calmly resolved, leaving behind nary a ripple of drama. Every character here is timid or well-meaning, and even those who haven\u2019t suffered a medical emergency are grappling with issues of the heart.With a script that doesn\u2019t always sparkle as it might, Nobody Has to Know resembles an Aki Kaurism\u00e4ki film minus the big laughs and drop-dead decor. Frank van den Eeden\u2019s cinematography does most of the heavy lifting, with numerous shots of the dramatic Isle of Lewis landscape, or lone characters staring out to sea. Fairley excels among the understated cast, even if Millie\u2019s emotional trajectory is predictable; from the moment we see her hair pinned tightly to her head, we know that its inevitable loosening can only be 90-odd minutes away. Nobody Has to Know is released on 3 November in UK cinemas.","104":"There are five nights to be survived at cursed old pizza spot Freddy Fazbear\u2019s yet it feels like an awful lot more in this surprisingly flat attempt to turn a hit video game into a hit movie. At a flabby, sign-of-the-times 110 minutes, there\u2019s far too much of so many things \u2013 dream sequences, exposition, first act buildup \u2013 and far too little of what one would naturally expect from something as surface-level silly as this \u2013 fun.It\u2019s partly because writer-director Emma Tammi and game creator Scott Cawthon, acting as co-writer here, seem frighteningly unsure of how seriously they\u2019re supposed to take Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s and so we\u2019re left equally confused. It clangs from straight-faced speeches about childhood trauma to cartoonish kids\u2019 movie-level goofiness, tonally awkward and strangely, maddeningly dull, unravelling a mystery that\u2019s as predictable as it is uninteresting. A film about murderous animatronic animals should not have one checking their watch quite so much \u2026Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s tells of a dilapidated Chuck E Cheese-esque pizza restaurant for kids, greasy slices soundtracked by a performing band of robotic mascots. Despite its closure years earlier, a security guard is still required to keep everyone out, a thankless position newly filled by troubled drifter Mike (Hunger Games alum Josh Hutcherson) with help from creepy career counselor Steve (Matthew Lillard). After the death of his parents, he\u2019s tasked with caring for his younger sister despite interference from his meddling aunt (a snarling Mary Stuart Masterson, acting as if she\u2019s a bad guy trying to send Beethoven to the pound). Mike remains stuck, forever haunted by the disappearance of his brother when they were kids, trying to find out what happened to him by replaying the day he went missing through his dreams. But sleeping on the job isn\u2019t the wisest idea \u2026For certain, perhaps older newcomers, there\u2019s something alluringly retro about the lurid B-movie set-up not just because of the 80s heyday of the setting but because of how equally throwback the idea is, recalling horrors of that era based on similarly ludicrous conceits, like Chopping Mall or Dolls or Death Spa. But a modernised take gets quickly deadened by genre problems of our time, focusing less on the nasty fun of watching possessed robot animals kill and more on the tedious inner torment of our one-note protagonist. Hemmed in by a family-friendly PG-13 rating, the death scenes are drab and artlessly censored but even with more violence, Tammi would still struggle to create the suspense we need and expect. Her film never once threatens to quicken one\u2019s pulse (a sequence using a ball-pit is a frustrating dud), the lumberingly slow pace of her tinny villains proving to be a problem she\u2019s never able to fix.She does a mostly competent job as director otherwise, her film looking more polished than many other Halloween offerings this year (Amazon\u2019s 80s-set Totally Killer looking entirely awful in comparison) but it\u2019s not enough to paper over the many cracks that the script introduces, with a dumb, convoluted plot that, even with such an overextended runtime, never makes a shred of sense. There are far too many scenes of Hutcherson\u2019s simple, sad-eyed lead gaining intel from an exposition-spouting cop played by You\u2019s Elizabeth Lail, interactions between the pair feeling like text-on-screen filler you wish you could expedite with a click of a button. There\u2019s just too much dialogue and not enough dying, a fatal misjudgment in just how invested we are in the film\u2019s feeble mystery. The big reveal is a big inevitability and the big showdown is a big letdown, with some misjudged scenery-chewing and laughable stabs at emotion.The low-stakes, late-night thrill we expect from the material never arrives, held back by a mixture of indecisive restraint and misplaced self-importance. Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s is somehow a slog to get through and will be promptly forgotten by morning.Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s is out now in cinemas in the UK and will be released on 27 October in cinemas and on Peacock in the US","105":"There\u2019s something initially intriguing in this gender-flipped take on Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde from the rebooted Hammer studio brand, starring Eddie Izzard as Dr Nina Jekyll. But it soon reveals itself as bafflingly laborious, leaden and self-conscious, with the star often going into the familiar quirky monologue-riffing style, which might be hilarious in Izzard\u2019s standup comedy, but it\u2019s weird in the wrong way here.The comedy in the central performance feels unsettled, undermining the film\u2019s horror potential, which is in any case damaged by the over-egged musical score and misfiring jump non-scares. The legendary dual personae of the story are not interestingly differentiated, or really differentiated at all, both being very much Izzard.Scott Chambers plays Rob Stevenson (middle name Louis), a young guy out of prison on licence, in need of work to please his parole officer, who might also be persuaded to give him access to his adored infant daughter. Thanks to his brother, Rob gets a job as live-in carer to reclusive billionaire scientist Dr Nina Jekyll, who has reportedly withdrawn from public life due to her health issues.Despite the pursed-lipped disapproval of Dr Jekyll\u2019s Mrs Danvers-y housekeeper (played by Lindsay Duncan), something in Rob\u2019s sweetness and honesty amuses Dr Jekyll and she gives Rob the position, with responsibility for looking after her in her vast secluded mansion and seeing that she gets her meds. But soon things go terribly wrong. There are cameos here from no less than Simon Callow and Jonathan Hyde, and it looks like an interesting experiment, but there is something fundamentally inert here. Doctor Jekyll is released on 27 October in UK cinemas.","106":"The toxic anti-Shangri-La of North Korea continues to provide a rich seam of material for film-makers: the late Claude Lanzmann recounted his personal experiences there in the 1950s in Napalm and Werner Herzog discussed the North Korean reverence for Mount Paektu in Into the Inferno. There are many more, including \u00c1lvaro Longaria\u2019s The Propaganda Game, Ross Adam and Robert Cannan\u2019s The Lovers and the Despot, Morten Traavik\u2019s Liberation Day and Ryan White\u2019s Assassins. So far no documentary film-maker to my knowledge has tackled one of North Korea\u2019s strangest events: Kim Jong-un\u2019s summit meeting in 2018 with Donald Trump, the man who\u2019d threatened him with \u201cfire and fury\u201d. Oddly, this otherwise excellent documentary about North Korea doesn\u2019t mention that, despite it coming within its timeline.Beyond Utopia is a nail-bitingly tense account of the network of safe houses and \u201cunderground railroads\u201d used by North Korean defectors to get to freedom, run by the South Korean human rights activist and Christian cleric Pastor Kim Sung-eun. (There is real escape footage here.) Despite the well-attested ideological iron grip exerted in North Korea (no one in this film uses the pro-regime term DPRK or Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea), there are in fact traffickers and brokers both there and in China who for a price are prepared to get people out.Half of this film is taken up by the heartrending study of a North Korean family being spirited over the border into China by Pastor Kim\u2019s organisation, where they are met by Kim\u2019s associates, who help them to look like South Korean tourists and then conduct them through Vietnam and Laos in conditions of extreme danger (both communist countries that could send them back to North Korea) and finally to freedom in Thailand. It is almost unbearably sad and funny when the elderly North Korean grandma, who can\u2019t rid herself of her lifelong reverence for the Pyongyang leadership, first sees a flat-screen plasma TV and assumes it\u2019s a blackboard for teaching.The film\u2019s second, and more brutal story is about a North Korean woman who has escaped, but whose son, having made a later attempt and got as far as China, has been sent back for brutal punishment; but he could, she is told by informants, be extracted again with payment of more bribes. But is this new plan just a North Korean plot (in which her son and elderly mother have been forced to co-operate) to lure her into a place where she herself can be kidnapped and sent back for a humiliating show trial?The film could have done with a few more specifics. How much money, for example, do the traffickers charge? And where does the money come from? Is it raised by the defectors\u2019 friends and relatives in South Korea? Or does Pastor Kim himself take donations for a continuously running fund? At all events, it\u2019s an outstanding documentary. Beyond Utopia is released on 27 October in UK and Irish cinemas.","107":"Abdallah Al-Khatib\u2019s searing documentary was completed two years ago; its arrival now has an awful new significance. The film conveys the day-by-day, moment-by-moment experience of Palestinians living in the Yarmouk refugee camp in Damascus, known as \u201cLittle Palestine\u201d (in fact, Al-Khatib\u2019s birthplace), while it was under siege by the Assad government from 2013 to 2015. This resulted in 181 people dying of hunger and ended when Islamic State took control of the camp. The terror group were themselves driven out by Russian and Syrian forces in 2018, resulting in most of the camp\u2019s destruction.The slow death from hunger is horrifying. People eat cactus, and then essentially weeds. Al-Khatib\u2019s camera often poignantly lingers on the brave and even cheerful faces of children, but one of the film\u2019s most disturbing moments comes when a little girl is shown placidly foraging in the rough ground among the weeds for the edible herb verbena. Like many of the people the film-maker speaks to, she is in a traumatised but eerily calm state \u2013 you can imagine her as an adult or an old woman \u2013 as body and mind try to adapt to lack of food. Nor does she appear to be scared, as the interviewer is, by the nearby explosions.A piece of graffiti reads: \u201cI am from a country where windows open on to an absence of food.\u201d An old man asks the film-maker if he has a sugared almond. A rare food-aid agency pours soup into people\u2019s carrier bags, these being the only receptacles left. A man howls in the street: \u201cWe don\u2019t want Palestine, just get us out of Syria \u2013 is there anything worse than this hunger?\u201d It is a record of the past, but an almost unbearable warning of agony yet to come. Little Palestine, Diary of a Siege is available from 27 October on True Story.","108":"David Yates takes time out from being the in-house director of the Fantastic Beasts films with a formulaic, factually based drama on a subject that has already been thoroughly explored by other, more serious-minded movies, documentaries and television series: America\u2019s opioid crisis and the cynical workings of big pharma. Using the accessible but now rather tired device of cutting faux documentary interviews with key characters into a conventional piece of storytelling (see also I, Tonya), the film is a loosely fictionalised version of the Insys Therapeutics scandal. What\u2019s novel here is that the film focuses not on the victims of the aggressively mis-sold cancer pain medication at the core of the story, but on the team of ambitious, money-hungry drug reps and company execs who will stop at nothing to hawk their product to unscrupulous doctors.It\u2019s predictable but glossily watchable. The main redeeming feature is the crackling charisma of Emily Blunt, in the central role of a down-on-her-luck single mum turned pharma marketing genius.In select cinemas now; on Netflix from 27 October","109":"This may be the first drama feature from documentary-directing duo Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (Free Solo), but the themes \u2013 human endurance, daunting physical challenges, needlessly reckless flirtations with death \u2013 provide a link to their previous work. The film tells the real-life story of Diana Nyad (a staunch performance from Annette Bening), a retired endurance swimmer who decided, aged 60, to get back in the water and attempt, once again, the gruelling 110-mile crossing from Cuba to Florida.It\u2019s a swim that takes more than two solid days, through waters populated by sharks and poisonous jellyfish. It defeated her once, at the prime of her fitness. But Diana is ferociously single-minded, making her a formidable athlete but an absolute nightmare at parties. Her best friend and trainer, Bonnie (Jodie Foster), repeatedly has to remind Diana that there are other possible conversational subjects apart from the remarkable achievements of Diana Nyad. And it\u2019s this \u2013 the wry humour provided by the long-suffering Bonnie; the lovely lived-in quality of the friendship \u2013 rather than the lengthy swimming sequences and a few slightly unwieldy flashbacks that gives the film its crowd-pleasing appeal.In selected cinemas and on Netflix","110":"The latest film in DreamWorks\u2019 irrepressibly perky and shamelessly Auto-Tuned Trolls series is a synthetic sparkle assault that looks as though it was assembled from the glitter and craft supply section of a well-stocked pound shop. In this, as well as the pick-and-mix greatest hits musical choices and morals, it\u2019s business as usual. The message of this latest round of fizzy pop philosophy stresses the importance of family, along with the usual themes of friendship and finding your voice. A flashback introduces us to the tragic backstory of Branch (Justin Timberlake): he was the youngest member of a boyband, named BroZone, made up of his older brothers. When the band split, so did the fraternal bonds. It\u2019s a peppy sugar rush that should please younger audiences, but the appeal of the series is wearing pretty thin.","111":"Arnold Schwarzenegger wants you to know that you\u2019re a lazy piece of shit. But he\u2019s going to tell you politely; with care and a few encouraging suggestions. He\u2019s going to be good-natured and nonjudgmental about it. Or a bit judgmental about it. But only because he doesn\u2019t want you to be a lazy piece of shit any more. Instead, he wants you to be useful.If that titular phrase sounds like something a parent tells their kid when said kid is hovering about after school, that\u2019s because it\u2019s exactly what Schwarzenegger\u2019s disciplinarian policeman father used to tell him (and, indeed, Arnie went on to sponsor a nationwide after-school programme). Schwarzenegger, 76, is now in the \u201cfourth act\u201d of his life. He\u2019s been the world\u2019s most famous bodybuilder, a Hollywood movie star, a surprise (mostly hit) governor of California and now an author and quasi-motivational speaker \u2013 the catalyst for which was the viral videos he posted during the US pandemic lockdown.I remember, in April 2020, watching Schwarzenegger on Twitter with his pet donkey Lulu and miniature horse Whiskey. The animals were \u201cdemonstrating\u201d social distancing guidance, while their owner radiated warmth in a terrifying time. Then came a different register: his stirring, home-filmed speech after January 6 in which he compared the storming of the Capitol to Kristallnacht and pleaded for the protection of US democracy. Maybe we had underestimated him. Zeitgeist-capturing animal lover; rhetorician for the ages. Who knew?Arnie knew. Because people \u2013 \u201cnaysayers\u201d \u2013 have underestimated him his whole life and he doesn\u2019t want you to doubt yourself for a second. Be Useful is a hybrid work. Part Jordan Peterson\u2019s bro life-hack manual slash pop philosophy (the book\u2019s subtitle, Seven Tools for Life, is very similar to Peterson\u2019s 12 Rules for Life); part Instagram motivational quotes slash Arianna Huffington\u2019s obsession with \u201cthriving\u201d, it is threaded through with relevant memoir.Self-help can be a dubious scene to be a part of. Not financially \u2013 the industry is booming to the point where life coaches will charge money for others to take their life-coaching courses in what is, as far as I can tell, a Ponzi scheme for dream-journaling. But there\u2019s the toxic masculinity of an Andrew Tate (and, to a lesser extent, Peterson) or the woo-woo of the wellness crew. Much of it is uncomfortably gendered, with polar extremities of dangerous and twee.But Schwarzenegger, far from the cyborg killing machine of his catchphrase film role, is an amiable instructor. A lot of the basic stuff here works. His idea to beget ideas is walking, which, as he points out, is not an original one (he must have thought of it while standing still); he\u2019s just seconding Nietzsche and Aristotle. He recommends incremental changes at first, which is what most primary care doctors might suggest. Lots of advice is similar to that found in 1980s and 90s classics of the genre that either attempted to compensate for the booming rat-race class or else leaned into it. He talks about surrounding yourself with supportive people. All this is good, sound practice. There are the usual Nelson Mandela and Dalai Lama citations. There is, mercilessly, nothing wacky.And there\u2019s plenty of humour to offset the more Sandhursty bits. When he talks about \u201cputting the work in\u201d during drama training, he jokes that he wants his money back for the accent-removal classes. He chops off the bottom half of every pair of his joggers so he can work on his calves more easily. He\u2019s also extremely smart (it still bums him out that bodybuilders are dismissed as airheads) and obsessed with knowledge. One section is called Be a Sponge. His approach is the opposite of Goveism; Schwarzenegger can\u2019t get enough of experts. Whether it\u2019s being taught how to bricklay to make ends meet, or being schooled on the history of gerrymandering as a rookie politician, Schwarzenegger wants your help. And, in turn, he\u2019ll pay it forward. Sometimes literally, as when donating $1m to Covid relief efforts or in time and mentorship, when teaching kids with learning disabilities to bench-press. He hates the phrase \u201cself-made\u201d because, while he recognises it\u2019s meant as a compliment, he believes the opposite \u2013 namely, it takes a village (specifically, in his case, Thal in Austria, and then a man called Fredi Gerstl).There\u2019s always a concern with books such as these: will they acknowledge the discriminatory nature of social hierarchical structures and institutions, economic circumstances, health issues and various other impediments to fulfilling potential? Schwarzenegger nods towards them, but more so takes the line that if he, a kid who grew up in a house with no running water, can make it, then anyone can. People will have their views on that, although he\u2019s transparent that one person\u2019s version of fulfilment (pushing through groundbreaking environmental legislation) might differ from another\u2019s (wholesome family; a good job that pays the bills). He loves pain, because \u201cpain is the measure of growth potential\u201d. I sort of love pain in the service of growth \u2013 which is why I\u2019m happy to swim in 4C open water \u2013 but most of us would be a bit pissed off if, say, a lackadaisical surgeon butchered our aorta during what was supposed to be a routine procedure. Arnie just sets about counting how many laps he can do to the bathroom while stuck in hospital.The triumph of this book is that it\u2019s quite rare in the self-help canon \u2013 or what publishers now term personal development \u2013 to not make a cynic such as myself roll their eyes, and this one doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s a shame that whoever was responsible for the jacket blurbs takes a shoving-a-finger-in-your chest approach that isn\u2019t replicated by the variable tone inside, which is sometimes dogmatic but often reflects the genuine kindness and enthusiasm of its author. Be Useful, it turns out, is very helpful. Be Useful: Seven Tools for Life by Arnold Schwarzenegger is published by Ebury Edge (\u00a320).

Shot on location in Iraq, this compelling fiction debut from seasoned documentary-maker Maysoon Pachachi paints a slice-of-life portrait of a mixed Baghdad neighbourhood during the tumultuous final week of 2006, a year memorably ended by the execution of Saddam Hussein.Save for a scene where a bargeman fishes out of the water the body of a woman presumably killed for her association with foreign forces, Our River \u2026 Our Sky alludes to the horrors of war and sectarian violence in subtle and non-explicit terms. Booming over the ordinary activities of children playing or family meals are the deafening sounds of explosions and harrowing discussions of streets filled with corpses.In its tapestry of intersecting stories, Pachachi\u2019s film underlines how wartime turmoil is more than just bloodshed; it kills the normalcy of everyday life and the capacity for dreams. When life in the present is hanging by a thread, the future is a mirage.At the centre of these interwoven lives is novelist Sara (Darina Al Joundi), who now uses the skills from her English literature PhD to translate paperwork for her fellow Iraqis. If the script, grappling with the burden of representation, occasionally draws certain supporting arcs in broad brushstrokes, Al Joundi\u2019s nuanced and exquisitely moving performance brings an emotional weight to Sara\u2019s dilemmas, as well as to other characters.Emphasising the resilience of those who choose to remain, Pachachi\u2019s film returns again and again to the river Tigris, a location that shows how the bond to a homeland is at once communal, spiritual, and fully corporeal. Our River \u2026 Our Sky is released on 20 October in UK cinemas.","113":"Shot over the course of 20 years, Helena T\u0159e\u0161t\u00edkov\u00e1\u2019s 2008 film Ren\u00e9 followed the near continuous prison stints of her charismatic subject; these happened in parallel with the colossal political changes that took place in the Czech Republic towards the end of the 20th century. Conceived as a sequel to this milestone work, Ren\u00e9: The Prisoner of Freedom is another long-term project which charts not just the dehumanising cycle of incarceration, but also the trappings of accidental fame.Beginning with scenes showing the jam-packed premiere of the earlier documentary, which turned Ren\u00e9 into an unlikely celebrity for Czech audiences, T\u0159e\u0161t\u00edkov\u00e1\u2019s new film observes how notoriety does not always translate into economic stability. Struggling to make ends meet, Ren\u00e9 took on various odd jobs, including as a delivery driver \u2013 which landed him back in prison for driving without a valid licence. Seemingly untouched by the media storm, Ren\u00e9 faces these obstacles with the same existential soulfulness that had made him such a compelling subject in the first film. A prolific writer himself, Ren\u00e9 frequently quotes authors such as Karel \u010capek and Albert Camus in reference to his frequent brushes with the law. The myth of Sisyphus \u2013 and his unceasing and absurd task of pushing a rock up the mountain \u2013 resonates with a man whose every effort to turn his life around goes up in smoke.While T\u0159e\u0161t\u00edkov\u00e1\u2019s earlier film was able to locate Ren\u00e9\u2019s life within larger sociopolitical contexts, this sequel, though intimate, is much less rigorous in its investigation of fame \u2013 and its seemingly aphrodisiac power over women \u2013 still less the director\u2019s own responsibility in creating this media phenomenon. What was once a portrait of a man as well as a nation has now downsized into a much more stylistically and politically moderate affair. Ren\u00e9: The Prisoner of Freedom is available from 20 October on True Story.","114":"The admirable Klassiki streaming service, in response to some modest proposals from myself, is now showcasing five movies from central Asian film-makers, and the first is this absolute gem from Kyrgyzstan. It is an autobiographical movie by writer-director Aktan Abdykalykov, much acclaimed on the European festival circuit on first release in 1998: a very personal and immediate film, but with the mystery and calm of a folk tale. It\u2019s a story of the director\u2019s own childhood, and he casts his own teenage son Mirlan as himself. Beshkempir has the fluency and candour of something by Satyajit Ray and its ecstatic retrieval of memory makes me think of Fellini\u2019s Amarcord.The film is mostly in black and white but starts in colour and enigmatically gives us flashes of colour throughout, picking out significant images with stabs of rapture: birds, a stretch of sky, a handful of money. We begin with a child\u2019s adoption ritual, the colour of this sequence focusing on the richness of the rugs used and the traditional cradle. We then flashforward 13 years or so and this same baby is now a tough-looking kid, impassively looking at us as he gets his hair cut; this is Mirlan Abdykalykov who reminds me of Shane Meadows\u2019s regular Thomas Turgoose.The boy is Beshkempir, always larking about with his cheeky mates instead of helping his gloweringly resentful dad around the house. They steal honey and release a cloud of bees while they\u2019re doing it. Their hormones freak them out at the sight of any girl or young woman, and they actually spy on a naked woman applying leeches to her skin, a fascinating and comic moment of transgression. Most bizarrely, they sculpt a sand model of a woman, with crude approximations of anatomy, take turns having sex with it and are then surreally interrupted by a herd of cattle which trample over the recumbent sand woman while the kids flee; it is a moment captured by Abdykalykov in an overhead shot, an inspired touch which Fellini would surely have enjoyed. But Beshkempir and his best mate are to fall out over the fact that one local girl very clearly prefers Beshkempir. The mate challenges him to a fight which the friend humiliatingly loses and, in his rage and spite, blurts out what he considers to be Beshkempir\u2019s shaming secret: that he is adopted.A confrontation between the boys\u2019 mothers provides catharsis of a sort; things stabilise, but then Beshkempir\u2019s adored grandmother dies and it is her wish that he deliver a traditional oration at her funeral, proclaiming that he will repay debts claimed by any of his grandmother\u2019s creditors, while forgiving any debts owed to her. The old woman has asked for Beshkempir to do this, not any of the adults, because she wanted him to take on an adult responsibility; it\u2019s a strangely affecting moment. There is a gentle, unforced artistry in Abdykalykov\u2019s film which unfolds to the sound of distant birdsong throughout: it\u2019s a great pleasure to have it revived . Beshkempir, the Adopted Son is available from 19 October on Klassiki.","115":"There\u2019s a rich mix of ingredients in this heartfelt and likably acted film from co-directors Kibwe Tavares and Daniel Kaluuya, set in a chaotic, favela-type London housing estate of the near future, nicknamed \u201cthe Kitchen\u201d. It takes something from the French banlieue movies of Mathieu Kassovitz and Ladj Ly, while running a seedier and more downbeat version of the postmodern alienation of Total Recall or Blade Runner. But it is also a slightly sentimental-realist family drama, and I felt that for all its high-energy pyrotechnics, in its final moments The Kitchen paints itself into a bit of a narrative corner.The Kitchen setting itself is tremendously fabricated on screen, with top-notch special effects work; it is a spectacularly rundown housing block surrounded on all sides by glitzy new apartment buildings for the heartless better off. The city authorities have in fact decided on the Kitchen\u2019s demolition and high-handedly ordered residents to leave, but the people are refusing on the grounds that this is where they have built their community and homes \u2013 for all its poverty, there is a bustling, vivid atmosphere.Izi (played by actor and musician Kane Robinson) is a hardworking guy, employed by a rather creepy eco-funeral business called Life After Life; it offers to mix post-cremation remains with seedlings and create a memorial plant. Izi is under no illusions as to what it\u2019s actually like living in the Kitchen, and he is saving up for a brand-new modern flat, part of precisely that sprawling property development which is putting pressure on the Kitchen. And here the film cleverly allows you to notice the living-death quality in both these apartments and the funeral plant gardens.At work one day, Izi notices that one of the soulless services routinely taking place in the facility\u2019s antiseptic chapel-style memorial zones is for a woman that he used to date. This woman\u2019s troubled teen son Benji (Jedaiah Bannerman) is there too, the only mourner, and a fellow Kitchen resident. Izi and Benji strike up an uneasy cross-generational friendship, each aware of a certain possibility that can hardly be said out loud. And back in the Kitchen itself, where armed police are getting ready to move in with tyrannical force, Benji has to decide if he wants to hang out with radical hoodlums or with caring, flawed Izi. But then Izi, too, must decide if he can imagine a future with Benji.There are some big-ticket action sequences: the robbing of an online food delivery van and a smash-and-grab raid on a jeweller in a posh part of town. They are impressive setpieces, not precisely exciting in the way they would be in a more generic thriller, but fiercely presented as symptoms of inequality. It is with the actual relationship between Izi and Benji that I felt that the movie moved with a heavier tread, though there are also some sharp notes of humour \u2013 the film providing a big laugh when Izi has to answer the flat-rental company\u2019s infuriatingly bland auto-generated voice prompts when he arrives to pay his deposit. A worthwhile, engaged film.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotion The Kitchen screened at the London film festival, and is released on 12 January in UK cinemas and on 19 January on Netflix.","116":"Here is a tightly laced, elegantly cut gothic period drama that might unfairly get overlooked as the barrage of upmarket cinema vying for awards begins. The 19th-century source material, Sheridan Le Fanu\u2019s novel Uncle Silas, isn\u2019t super well-known outside university literature departments, and the lead actors aren\u2019t especially famous names either \u2013 although gravelly-voiced David Wilmot, here playing the heavy, has built a career making indelible impressions with supporting roles on film (The Wonder, Ordinary Love, Calm With Horses) and TV (Station Eleven). Likewise, if you caught limited TV series Ridley Road then the talents of Agnes O\u2019Casey will already be a known quantity. But in a way, the freshness of face and\/or versatility of both O\u2019Casey and Wilmot, along with the rest of the cast, are what makes this feel like a discovery. It\u2019s definitely something new and different as it insightfully reworks some classic feminist literary notions, filtered through a very 21st-century approach to period material with its unsettling score, jittery editing and nods to horror tropes.At a girthy mansion called Knowl, at one point described as \u201ca barracks of a place\u201d somewhere in the Irish countryside, teenager Maud Ruthyn (O\u2019Casey) has just inherited everything after the death of her father. However, she\u2019s still a minor and, more unfortunately for her, a woman and therefore not fit to make decisions for herself; Maud therefore becomes the ward of her uncle Silas (Wilmot) until she comes of age. Keen to honour her father\u2019s wishes and the terms of her inheritance, Maud welcomes Silas to her home even though she barely knows him and that he was once accused of murdering a man to whom he owed money \u2013 but got off thanks to lack of evidence. Exuding the slithery bonhomie of a cobra meeting a mongoose for the first time, Silas makes himself at home, bringing along his feckless son Edward (Chris Walley) and flibbertigibbet daughter Emily (Holly Sturton), along with Emily\u2019s governess Madame (Grainne Keenan). Before long, Silas\u2019s sinister intentions become clear, which include bullying Maud into marrying her cousin Edward and bribing the servants to turn against her. When brutalising her by proxy doesn\u2019t work, the conspirators threaten to have her committed to an asylum for hysterical women, equipped with what sounds like a 19th-century waterboarding kit.But Maud has a mongoose\u2019s survival instinct, and the haughty blue-eyed gaze of an aristocratic matron who won\u2019t be screwed around so easily. The script by Elisabeth Gooch appropriates the fruity diction of the times just enough to add credibility without getting bogged down in circumlocution, and O\u2019Casey\u2019s delivery is sharp as a steak knife. It\u2019s a delight to watch her verbally spar with Wilmot\u2019s Silas, coyly jabbing at each other according to the rules of civility but growing more acrimonious as the stakes get higher. Director Lisa Mulcahy (Wasteland, The Legend of Longwood) clears the paths and lets them rip with confident, clear-sighted direction. Lies We Tell is released on 13 October in Irish and Northern Irish cinemas.","117":"There is such raw emotional intimacy in this dazzling documentary from Estonia, filmed in a cabin in the woods where a group of women meet regularly to take a sauna. Estonia\u2019s centuries-old tradition of smoke saunas is Unesco-listed, we learn in the final credits (along with French baguette-making and beekeeping in Slovenia, according to the agency\u2019s website). In the past, babies were born in smoke saunas, the sick were brought to them; they were even used to cure ham. For the women in the film, in the hours sweating naked in the hut \u2013 away from families, phones, the relentless exhausting to-do list of being a woman \u2013 something happens. They talk: sharing stories, saying the unsayable, nothing off limits. It sounds cheesy but in a deep way the experience is cleansing, sweating the pain away.There is an otherworldly intensity to director Anna Hints\u2019 photography, illuminating faces and flesh like candlelight, all warmth and heat. The women\u2019s conversations cover everything, from body image hang-ups to complicated relationships with their mothers. There\u2019s a funny bit about dick pics; one woman wonders what would happen if she started sending \u201cpussy pics\u201d to men. Every now and then they dash outside for a freezing dip in the lake (in winter taking an axe to the frozen-over water to dig a bathing hole). The chanting and birch-branch cleaning \u2013 presumably ancient smoke sauna rituals \u2013 add to the sacred-space mystical feel. (It also made me think of Kate Bush \u2013 she\u2019d love this vibe, I\u2019m sure.)This is a film that weaves a spell, the camera resting often not on the woman talking but on the person listening to her, thereby creating the impression of a universal experience of women. One listener in particular is transfixing; eyes shut, she seems to absorb others\u2019 experiences into her body. We watch her face as a woman tells the story of how she was brutally raped as a teenager while hitchhiking; it\u2019s a moment of shocking power that any writer thinking of adding a rape scene to a fiction film should be forced to watch first. Smoke Sauna Sisterhood is released on 13 October in UK and Irish cinemas.","118":"Who\u2019s up for a golden-hued heartwarmer set in 60s Ireland starring Kathy Bates and Maggie Smith about women with secret fears and dreams going on a church trip to Lourdes and finally finding the real miracle is their new compassion for each other? The answer to this question could well have been \u2026 me. I have a liking for a gentle tale and there is nothing necessarily wrong with, just occasionally, showing Ireland and the church of this period with something other than outrage and horror. But The Miracle Club does not at any time, to use a discredited metaphor, throw away its crutches and walk. And it\u2019s painful to note that this is largely because of the way film can\u2019t convincingly use that estimable actor Laura Linney in a central role. She is upstaged by the older, fruitier performances and doesn\u2019t hold her own with a more serious persona.In a tough district of Dublin, four women each have reasons for going on a trip to Lourdes. Tough-as-nails Eileen Dunne (Bates) is worried about the lump she has found in her breast, but would rather go to Lourdes than see a doctor; her shiftless husband Frank (Stephen Rea) wonders grumpily who is going to cook his supper. Maggie Smith is Lily Fox, a woman with a small disability in her leg, but whose reasons for going to Lourdes are more to do with her spiritual pain at the loss of her son. Twentysomething Dolly Hennessy (Agnes O\u2019Casey) is going to bring along her little boy who for some reason will not speak. All find that their menfolk are obstructive about wives going to Lourdes or indeed doing anything independent whatsoever.But the older women are astonished at the arrival from the US of Chrissie (Linney), the errant daughter of their deceased best friend. She left under a cloud 20 years before for reasons easily guessed at, and now wants to come along to Lourdes as well \u2013 and she\u2019s roundly resented for it. When the women do arrive in Lourdes in the company of kindly Fr Dermot (Mark O\u2019Halloran) there is some fun to be had in the holy-water baths they are expected to take and it is funny when Bates and Smith, gingerly stepping into the icy depths dressed in towels, squawk with genuine horror at the chill \u2013 the film\u2019s one genuine moment, adroitly juxtaposed with memories of how some women took ice-cold baths to bring about miscarriages.But Linney looks solemn and inert; and the movie\u2019s darker revelations feel mishandled, given the general note of lenient sentimentality. The figures of Eileen and Lily might remind you of the 60s Dublin matriarch Agnes Browne, played by Anjelica Huston in the 1999 movie of the same name, the character that screenwriter Brendan O\u2019Carroll later developed for his broad TV comedy Mrs Brown\u2019s Boys.

The line was uttered by Philip Vincent, a Harrow-educated motorbike designer who made some of the world\u2019s fastest \u2013 and priciest \u2013 motorbikes of the postwar era. This serviceable documentary narrated, a bit blandly, by McGregor tells Vincent\u2019s story with contributions by fellow celebrity petrolheads Jay Leno and the Clash\u2019s Paul Simonon.Vincent was clearly a man of extraordinary drive and determination. He went into business aged 19, after being booted out of Cambridge for spending more time tinkering than studying engineering. When he opened a factory in Stevenage, they\u2019d test drive the motorbikes on local roads; an employee once got caught doing 110 mph. This was in the 1930s, and when the case came to trial, the judge refused to believe a motorbike could reach such a speed, and dismissed the case, warning the police not to waste court time.The profile of Vincent here does, however, feel somewhat underdeveloped, perhaps out of politeness. Employees remember him as high handed and arrogant \u2013 \u201che wound people up\u201d \u2013 but we don\u2019t hear the stories and anecdotes that would have brought the man to life. What is clear is that Vincent was a better inventor than business owner, and by the 1950s, his factory was losing huge sums of money. Its bikes fell out of fashion, too; one of its final models laughed off as \u201can old man\u2019s wheelchair\u201d.After the factory went under, Vincent scratched a living writing for motorcycle magazines. His daughter recounts his unhappy final years, living in a council house in west London. Inevitably perhaps, Vincent bikes have become collector\u2019s items \u2013 in 2018, a 1951 Black Lightning sold for nearly $1m, setting the record for most expensive motorbike at auction. Speed Is Expensive is released on 14 October in UK cinemas and is available now on digital platforms. This article was amended on 10 October 2023 to remove a reference to \u201cmotorways\u201d, which were not in existence at the time.","120":"Jeff Nichols\u2019s motorcycle movie is about a love triangle and a succession crisis \u2013 inspired by the immersive 1968 study of Chicago bikers by photojournalist Danny Lyon, whose black-and-white pictures flash up with the closing credits. This film opens up the storytelling throttle with a throaty growl, delivering the doomy romance of an old-fashioned western and the thrills of a mob drama.The Bikeriders is set in a world in which the increasingly careworn gang leader competes for the affection of his toughest follower with this man\u2019s girlfriend, while at the same time grooming him as his heir. Yet this is a group where the biker king \u2013 whatever his plans for a dauphin \u2013 can be challenged for the crown by any subordinate according to the rules of his own violence-democracy, the incumbent gruffly asking: fists or knives?Tom Hardy is Johnny, truck-driver, family man and founding head honcho of the 60s Chicago motorbike club, The Vandals, inspired to form his gang after the ecstatic epiphany of watching Marlon Brando in The Wild Ones on TV; the film\u2019s whole approach in laying out Johnny\u2019s life circumstances is to imagine an answer to Brando\u2019s famous reply to being asked what he\u2019s rebelling against: what do you got?His leather-clad guys and blacktop battlers have monikers like something from West Side Story: bleary draft-reject Zipco (Michael Shannon); beefy Cockroach (Emory Cohen); loyal lieutenant Brucie (Damon Herriman); California recruit Funny Sonny (Norman Reedus) and dependable footsoldiers Corky (Karl Glusman) and Wahoo (Beau Knapp).Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotionBut the toughest, sexiest and most smoulderingly badass of the whole lot is Benny, played by Austin Butler, the only one of the Vandals who directly takes on the law and whose violent altercation with civilian locals results in a gruesome injury which Johnny will have to avenge \u2013 leading to his gang\u2019s mutation into a quasi-crime mob, attracting starstruck wannabe joiners from all over the country, including Vietnam vets with serious drug habits, making the burden of leadership all but intolerable.But Benny is deeply in love with Kathy, played by Jodie Comer with tough pugnacity and an outrageous northwestern accent with which you could slice a chrome tailpipe in two. She is effectively the narrator, speaking to Danny Lyon himself, played by Mike Faust. Like Lorraine Bracco\u2019s Karen in Scorsese\u2019s Goodfellas, Kathy is a respectable working-class woman who never intended to get drawn into this world, but found Benny very attractive just as he was beguiled by her cool, sceptical confidence. It is Kathy who can see the ritual absurdity of the Vandals\u2019 codes of masculinity \u2013 how, having affected to despise rules, they set up a club with a huge amount of rules, followed with pedantic solemnity like a cross between the army and the Rotary club. She can see how her Benny is going to die one day in the service of this crazy group, and so a duel for possession begins between her and Johnny.Unlike the heroes of Dennis Hopper\u2019s Easy Rider \u2013 a film which is to provide employment for one of the group \u2013 the bikeriders have no end or quest in view. They just drift around, assemble for \u201cpicnics\u201d in green spaces they churn into mud during races and get into fights with other gangs with whom they later cordially have beers. A lot of their time is spent almost catatonically hanging out at a bar in which there is a big discussion about the costs involved in installing a phone behind the bar which their membership subs would entitle them to use on club business.The Bikeriders is in its way like Kathryn Bigelow\u2019s The Loveless (1981) in depicting the grain of their empty world, while stopping short of showing us their places of employment. What we\u2019re watching is a weekend existence, like that of army reservists: we don\u2019t get to see Johnny\u2019s work as a truck driver \u2013 although on his way out of the house for a rumble, he tells his wife he\u2019ll pick up some eggs on the way home. As for Benny\u2019s life, it appears to be Kathy paying the bills and putting the roof over his head \u2013 although there is no question of Benny feeling emasculated, other than when she has to look after him after an injury.The biker\u2019s way of life is not precisely ironised or satirised, and the film incidentally doesn\u2019t question its heterosexuality (gay biker images which were to become an underground US pop culture staple do not feature). Johnny and Benny\u2019s relationship is more father and son. The performances here aren\u2019t subtle exactly: with Comer\u2019s fierce twang, Butler\u2019s soft purr and Hardy\u2019s sibilant Brandoesque drawl. But there\u2019s such enormous potency and impact in everything they do onscreen.","121":"Zoltan Korda\u2019s thrilling movie version of Alan Paton\u2019s novel was first released in 1951, when South Africa\u2019s racist apartheid policy was only three years of age and maybe enough of a novelty to be thought of as something amenable to second thoughts, capable of being reformed or even abolished. Paton\u2019s novel itself was published in 1948, the same year as apartheid appeared. Now this film is rereleased, revealing again that it has a crusading preacher\u2019s urgency and moral seriousness, appropriate for a story of priests.After a slow start, the movie hits a muscular, compelling stride; it is a drama with an obvious biblical parallel, but also a quite genuine Shakespearean resonance in the tragic dimension of its final act and the Montague\/Capulet reconciliation it envisions for black and white, bought with the self-sacrificial forgiveness for a capital crime. Perhaps modern audiences would be restive at a story about apartheid South Africa that appears to centre its eventual moral judgment amid the white community and white victimhood, but its passion and idealism blaze out.It is a drama of the country and the city. In the fictional village of Ndotsheni, whose lush upper slopes are farmed by the white man and the stonier lower ground by the \u201cnatives\u201d, an old black minister, Stephen Kumalo, is deeply troubled by the absence of his son, named Absalom, perhaps after King David\u2019s son in the Bible. Absalom has some years before left for the fleshpots of Johannesburg, allegedly to find his aunt, Stephen\u2019s sister, who has reportedly gone to the bad there. But Absalom, like many others, has also sought the higher wages and greater freedoms offered in the city. He may well have simply gone to the bad himself.Kumalo is played by the veteran US stage and screen actor and civil rights campaigner Canada Lee, who in making this British film was a refugee from America\u2019s McCarthy-ism (like its uncredited co-writer John Howard Lawson). Lee\u2019s performance is the very embodiment of sorrow in old age borne with stoicism, and his anguished gaze seems to wander almost sightlessly all over the screen.Meanwhile, in parallel, a white farmer called Jarvis (played with thoughtful restraint by Charles Carson) works the land as best he can; he is a Forsterian \u201csun-dried bureaucrat\u201d complaining like his white neighbours about the shortcomings of his black workforce, and baffled and irritated by the liberal enthusiasms of his son, who lives in Johannesburg and works for better housing for the black population. Jarvis may be a political hawk, but his wife is a gentle dove: this is Margaret, played by Joyce Carey (perhaps best known as the railway teashop manager in David Lean\u2019s Brief Encounter; her more refined voice here puts the stage cockney into perspective).Stephen journeys to Johannesburg, as innocent as a child for all his grey hairs, on a mission to find his son; he is helped there by a brotherhood of missionary clergymen, including Msimangu (an excellent, forthright performance from Sidney Poitier). And here he is to come across his worldly scapegrace brother John (Edric Connor), a carpenter who cares nothing for Stephen\u2019s scruples, and also his son\u2019s pregnant girlfriend. He will discover the awful truth about Absalom (Lionel Ngakane) and his drift into crime and his fateful connection with Jarvis\u2019s well-meaning, campaigning son \u2013 whose journals old Jarvis is finally to read, and from which he gains some understanding about South Africa for the first time in his life.Cry, the Beloved Country is very greatly about the importance of the Christian church as a unifying moral force: an authority in which black and white can find unity (in this way so very similar to the US civil rights movement). It is unashamedly and unfashionably a religious film, with a vehement speech from the white Father Vincent (Geoffrey Keen), delivered to Stephen in the depths of his agony and angry doubt. It also has a belief in decency (two different characters make apologies, at two different stages, about the rude and boorish way that they have just behaved); quaint, perhaps, but also possessing dignity and idealism. It is an utterly absorbing film. Cry, the Beloved Country is released on 9 October on digital platforms, Blu-ray and DVD.","122":"Michael Caine and the late Glenda Jackson bring their A games to this true-life heartwarmer about the 89-year-old second world war Royal Navy veteran Bernard Jordan, who in 2014 jauntily sneaked out of his seaside care home (where he lived with his wife Irene) on a secret mission to get aboard a cross-channel ferry and attend the 70th anniversary celebrations of the D-day landings in Normandy \u2014 having failed to get included on an official group excursion. He was dubbed \u201cthe great escaper\u201d in the press although then, as now, the care home insisted that there was no question of forbidding Bernard from going, so there was no escape as such. Facetiously representing them as busybody elf \u2019n\u2019 safety camp commandants \u2013 tempting though this might have been \u2013 could have landed the film in legal hot water.Caine is Jordan, of course, bringing plenty of droll and lugubrious spark to the role, shuffling up and down the seafront, grumpily denouncing the trendy cyclists almost running him over on the pavement as \u201ctossers\u201d and letting the air out of their tyres. But he is arguably upstaged by Jackson as Irene, or Rene, who is sarky and sardonic to everyone, including her care worker Adele (an excellent performance from Danielle Vitalis).She gets laughs in a way Caine\u2019s character doesn\u2019t, or not as much. Rene has to cover up for Bernard; she is, after all, in on his plan, and tells the nurses and managers that her absent husband is just out on a long early walk, giving Bernard enough time to get on the ferry before the alarm is raised.There\u2019s a huge amount to enjoy from these legendary performers: Caine and Jackson are a great double-act, despite being apart for much of the film, and the film imagines an interesting and poignant rapport between Bernard and an elderly ex-RAF officer on the ferry, sympathetically played by John Standing, who is heading for Normandy while crucified by a secret guilt. Caine has a bold flash of rage by the official graves at all the criminal waste of lives created by war.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotionSet against this, the flashback scenes of the young Rene and Bernard are less strong and a flaw in the film is that it somehow can\u2019t help drifting towards an officially sanctioned sentimentality and even stateliness, rather like the BBC news coverage of the D-day celebrations of which we see a glimpse. It\u2019s a kind of piety which the (excellent) lead performances are always working against. I\u2019m inclined to wonder how many movie versions of Captain Sir Tom Moore and his legendary lockdown charity walk were once in development in the same vein, with the same present day\/wartime flashback structure, but which now have had to be abandoned or radically reimagined.Well, Caine and Jackson and their ineffable class give this film some real grit: it\u2019s a wonderful last hurrah for Jackson and there is something moving and even awe-inspiring in seeing these two British icons together. The Great Escaper is released on 6 October in UK cinemas, and in May 2024 in Australia.","123":"Here is a punchy Canadian comedy-drama in that burgeoning true-life genre which could loosely be called Tech Startup Hubris; we\u2019ve seen Dumb Money (about GameStop), WeCrashed (about WeWork), and The Beanie Bubble (about the bizarre 90s web-driven tulip-style craze for Beanie Babies). The great ancestor of them all is naturally David Fincher\u2019s The Social Network, about Facebook, with its propulsive script by Aaron Sorkin. This film is a fictionally souped-up account of the steep rise and sudden fall of the BlackBerry, the handset device that towards the end of the 00s was so ubiquitous and addictive among the white-collar classes it was known as the \u201cCrackberry\u201d.But then Steve Jobs unveiled his iPhone, and the BlackBerry executives suddenly looked like a bunch of brontosauruses that had been hit in the face by a meteor.Jay Baruchel plays BlackBerry\u2019s greying co-founder Mike Lazaridis; a shy, nerdy, brilliant innovator who is details-obsessive. Matt Johnson, who is the film\u2019s director and co-writer, plays Mike\u2019s goofball partner Doug Fregin, and Johnson\u2019s directing duties perhaps meant he\u2019d taken the eye off his own performance a little, as he does little other than stare with sweaty, slack-jawed and horrified incredulity at his buddy Mike selling out to the Man.This latter is represented by gimlet-eyed investor Jim Balsillie, played by Glenn Howerton, almost unrecognisable from his role on TV\u2019s It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia; Balsillie is the uptight suit-wearing guy who gets these nerdy Star Wars-loving dopes and slackers into financial shape (while of course betraying their creative, fooling-around ethos). These three cartoony personae loosely correspond to Mark Zuckerberg, Eduardo Saverin and Sean Parker as portrayed in The Social Network; none of them, however, have a family or romantic life away from the office, an important part of how Sorkin conceived his characters.Well, this is a watchable enough film; there is hilarious delusion in Balsillie\u2019s fanatical desire to buy up hockey teams with his new superwealth, and pure pathos when the BlackBerry team watch Jobs demonstrating the iPhone, like silent movie veterans witnessing the new talkies, speaking out loud their own imminent demise. Blackberry is released on 6 October in UK and Irish cinemas.","124":"In this decidedly odd mishmash of genres, hard-boiled Hong Kong police corruption and gangland intrigue rub shoulders with a dance montage that pays homage to Singin\u2019 in the Rain. The latest from director Philip Yung (Port of Call), Where the Wind Blows is ambitious and visually arresting (it\u2019s particularly recommended for fans of slow-motion shots of people walking moodily through the neon-drenched underbelly of 1960s Hong Kong). Unfortunately, even the considerable star power of Tony Leung Chiu-wai and Aaron Kwok in the lead roles of rival cops can\u2019t salvage this cluttered and frequently bewildering piece of storytelling.","125":"Amputation devices, eye-socket vacuum contraptions, auto-craniotomy and an entrail lasso: it\u2019s business as usual, then, for the torture carousel that is the Saw franchise. A terminal cancer diagnosis has not mellowed the endlessly inventive serial murderer John Kramer (Tobin Bell, looking even more like a judgmental skull than usual) in a 10th outing, which is set in a time period between the first and second instalments.Having run out of options with conventional medicine, John travels to Mexico for risky \u2013 and very expensive \u2013 experimental treatment. You can probably guess where this is going. He leaves, if not with a new lease of life, then at least with a renewed appetite for his \u201chobby\u201d. Grisliness occurs, accompanied by a score that sounds like knives being sharpened on violins. It\u2019s thoroughly unpleasant, but that\u2019s rather the point.","126":"Only the most hardened Wes Anderson sceptic could fail to be charmed by the director\u2019s latest. The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar is his second Roald Dahl adaptation (after Fantastic Mr Fox) and, at just 37 minutes\u2019 running time, it\u2019s a densely detailed journey with an intricate Russian doll story structure. The baton is passed from narrator to narrator, starting with Ralph Fiennes as Dahl in his writing shed; then, among others, to Benedict Cumberbatch in the title role of Henry Sugar, an affluent playboy and inveterate gambler who develops the ability to see through objects. It\u2019s a skill he hopes to use to cheat at cards, but he discovers something rather more profound instead.This is an archetypal Anderson film: mannered, fussy, obsessively designed \u2013 normally irksome traits, but in this alchemic instance it\u2019s an utterly delightful combination. On Netflix","127":"Sex and power are inextricably grafted together in the relationship between Emily (Phoebe Dynevor) and Luke (Alden Ehrenreich), both rising star analysts for a Wall Street hedge fund. Which is fine, as long as both are on an even footing. But then Emily unexpectedly gets promoted, and Luke\u2019s alpha male assurance shrivels, along with his libido.The slick feature debut from TV director Chloe Domont (Ballers, Billions), Fair Play pitches a battle of the sexes in a cut-throat arena where one misjudgment can cost tens of millions of dollars. Wildly ambitious employees scan the office like expensively tailored meerkats, scenting danger in their colleagues\u2019 successes. And Luke, face set in a grimace of a smile, chips away his girlfriend\u2019s self-esteem with a drip-feed of doubts. It\u2019s maliciously effective, up to a point: an enjoyably lurid piece of classy-trashy psychological warfare. Unfortunately, both the plot and the performances boil over in the third act, and the film loses much of its icily calculated cool.In select cinemas now; on Netflix from 6 October","128":"Denise (Freya Tingley) and Johnny (Charles Grounds) are drug buddies living in present-day Melbourne. When they\u2019re not getting high, they spend their time mooching about, bickering, and arguing about whether some of the fancier words Johnny uses are real. (Funnily enough, most of the time they are.) They are what the cops might uncharitably describe as no-hopers.In what turns out to be a labyrinthine time-travelling plot, one day, the dirty duo\u2019s regular drug dealer, Kane (Joshua Morton), sends them on a mission to a dilapidated house to steal a bag full of crystal meth, a chore that will clear their debt to him. Kane warns them not to try the supply, but of course garrulous Johnny does and within seconds he evaporates with a snap and whoosh of wind right before Denise\u2019s face. In an edit, he finds himself in the same house but 25 years or so in the past, when the home was in better nick and occupied by jumpy former undercover cop Tracey (Elise Jansen). In the present, meanwhile, Denise meets her future self who is also using the time-travel meth and has come back to give her a warning. The rest of the movie skips back and forth, using the same location and four actors, until it gradually reveals the fundamental relationships between the characters and periods.Nerdy viewers can watch and nitpick over whether the sci-fi logic makes any sense, but it\u2019s clear that writer-director Sam Odlum is less interested in quantum mechanics than in crafting a surreptitiously affecting \u201cfairytale for cunts\u201d \u2013 to quote a phrase Denise mutters early on. And like a good fairytale, there is a lot of business with lost relatives, secret identities and people stuck in magically enchanted locations that help to keep the budget low. Grounds and Tingley in particular keep their performances just on the biting point between broadly comic and genuinely vulnerable, making for a viewing experience that is altogether more enjoyable than a bare-bones plot description suggests. Time Addicts is released on 25 September on the Icon Film Channel and on 27 October in UK cinemas. In Australia, it will screen at Monster Fest in Melbourne in October, ahead of a 7 December cinematic release.","129":"This is a film based on a true story, but it doesn\u2019t make this faith-based romantic drama look or feel anything like reality. It is adapted from a memoir by the American author and academic Carolyn Weber about her time at Oxford on a full scholarship writing a PhD on the Romantics. I felt it in the pit of my stomach about 10 minutes in when it dawned on me the \u201csurprise\u201d was that she found God.Directed by Ryan Whitaker, this is a film very much in keeping with the conventions of Christian drama: blandly inspirational with a glazed-over style of acting, aside from some gobsmackingly unsubtle eccentric professors, hammily performed by actors including Simon Callow. (I half-wondered if the crew stumbled across poor Callow on the streets of the city and frogmarched him on to the set.)Rose Reid plays Caro, a hardworking and gifted American student who arrives at the fictional Tirian college on a full scholarship. Flashbacks to her childhood shine a light on Caro\u2019s drive and determination. In the present day, we get Oxford-for-foreigners, all pints, and crazy Brit traditions, architectural splendour, even a horse-mounted bobby offering her a lift in the wee hours.In her first couple of weeks, agnostic-bordering-atheist Caro meets tousle-haired fellow American Kent (Ruairi O\u2019Connor), a Christian who plans to stay chaste until marriage. (\u201cIt\u2019s more a well-intentioned attempt than a reality.\u201d) The will-they-won\u2019t-they relationship between Caro and Kent is deadly boring (and conducted within the bounds of a U certificate). The intellectual debate between them on the nature of faith \u2013 touching on CS Lewis\u2019s memoir about his conversion to Christianity, Surprised by Joy \u2013 is even more dreary. Like a lot of faith movies, it reminded me of Socialist Workers selling papers on the high street: the purpose is to convert people but really it feels like they are just talking to themselves. Surprised by Oxford screens on 27 September and 1 October in UK cinemas","130":"Here is a strange, stark documentary from Austrian film-maker Ruth Beckermann, first presented at last year\u2019s Berlin film festival: somewhere between a lab experiment and a practical joke, featuring the kind of non-professional performers who could easily crop up in a movie by Ulrich Seidl, that renowned Austrian chronicler of male grotesqueness.The film\u2019s purpose is to challenge the gendered nature of erotica and pornography through the simple but effective expedient of making men the object of the porn gaze. Beckermann puts men on camera as they read aloud \u2013 at various levels of excruciating discomfort \u2013 the female narrative voice from Josephine Mutzenbacher, a once-scandalous Viennese novel that contains the fictional confessions of a prostitute, published anonymously in 1906 and now thought to be the work of Felix Salten, who bizarrely also wrote the original Bambi books.Beckermann advertised for men to audition for a film version of Josephine Mutzenbacher that she claimed to be making, but of course wasn\u2019t. Age and experience? No problem. She gets the resulting miscellaneous bunch (one man actually has an ear trumpet) to sit on a plush red couch in what looks like some disused factory, and choose an explicit passage from the book to read aloud. Afterwards, she asks what they think, about their own early sexual experiences and what they think about the book\u2019s still controversial paedophile passages. Periodically she gets her auditionees to gather together and chant the crudest bits like a football crowd. Many of the men are humorous and articulate; others are disquietingly intense and weird. One man commented that all the men in the book are revealed to be equally base, like those in Lars von Trier\u2019s Dogville \u2013 a very interesting and apt comparison, one that comes close to intuiting the Von Trier-ish trick being played on these men.But these men no doubt had to sign some sort of legal waiver to be used in the film, and perhaps Beckermann, like the hoax master Sacha Baron Cohen, actually paid them in cash then and there to head off any future legal comeback. Were they perhaps told that these \u201caudition\u201d scenes were going to be on the DVD extras? Or even form part of a larger, experimentalist adaptation? Maybe. Beckermann could have been a little more transparent with us about her working practices, but her anatomy of male fantasy is candid and apt.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotion Mutzenbacher is available from 29 September on True Story.","131":"\u2018So, you call yourself conceptualists, do you?\u201d says the straight-arrow detective quizzing Melissa (Chelsea Edge), a cool-customer art student with three long lacerations on her face. \u201cMostly. Ashley wasn\u2019t,\u201d Melissa replies. \u201cUnless anti-conceptualism is a concept. She was always about being in the moment. Expressionism. Impressionism.\u201d End of Term has a fondness for bandying around the art-theory big talk, but this silly but stolidly genre project could sorely use a conceptual cutting edge itself.Melissa is getting questioned after being found strapped to a chair in the blood-splattered basement of Ford Barrington art school. Strangely, there are no bodies \u2013 except for that of snooty art critic Damian Self (Ronald Pickup) in the nearby space for the students\u2019 end-of-term exhibition. In Usual Suspects-style piecemeal flashbacks, Melissa fills in the police on the buildup to the butchery and the halls of residence gallery of Cluedo-ish suspects, including her vampish one-time lover Ashley (Nicole Posener), the suave Professor Leigh (Peter Davison, a former Doctor in Doctor Who), and wild card Garth Stroman (Ivan Kaye), a rumoured ghost of a Byronic artist obsessed with a credo that art must involve pain.Director Mat Menony\u2019s fusion of country-house whodunnit and slasher flick is campy without sparking much excitement. There is barely any heat in the flurry of bitching and bedhopping that serves as preamble, the dialogue is trite across the board, and there is a will-this-do? quality to the featured artwork. Fictional works of art are notoriously hard to pull off, but the ludicrous S&M chair \u2013 which proclaims \u201csee no evil\u201d to the occupant while jabbing at their eye cavities \u2013 won\u2019t be bothering the Turner prize.Critically, we never find out Melissa\u2019s artistic principles either: instead, she serves mechanically as the sullen narrator of this avant gardists\u2019 pantomime. Milking the inane artsploitation angle \u2013 with Stroman hellbent on achieving his grisly magnus opus Incruxiatis Veritas \u2013 would have been fine if the film were not so stilted and drawn out. The artist has to suffer, says the hoary revenant, but End of Term didn\u2019t have to inflict it on the audience too. End of Term is available on digital platforms on 2 October.","132":"For those only passingly interested in the subject, this resolutely adequate portrait of guitarist Carlos Santana is the cinematic equivalent of a well-written and factchecked Wikipedia page but with loads more pictures and film clips. Hardcore fans may feel better served by the deep dive into Santana\u2019s childhood and youth in Mexico, followed by his breakthrough into the San Francisco psychedelic music scene, and then on to that career-making performance at Woodstock in 1969. Forgive me if you have heard this one before, but Santana supposedly dropped acid given to him by Jerry Garcia from the Grateful Dead, expecting he would have hours to come down before his band, named after him, had to go on and play. Instead, they were called on stage soon after. The weird faces Santana can be seen making in the immortal documentary of the festival are apparently a result of him thinking that the neck of his guitar was a snake that he had to wrestle into musical submission. Those were the days.After the hit albums and huge tours of the 1970s, the story gets a bit duller \u2013 as most of these stories do. The narrative takes in the inevitable dissolution of the first marriage, the low times and then the comeback when Santana shifted musical direction a bit. As a documentary subject, albeit one clearly very much in control of his image here and not about to let the film-makers show him in anything but a flattering light, he comes across pretty well: articulate, still vain enough to have himself filmed shirtless, but grounded by strong family ties. That said, two of his sisters are interviewed and you can tell by their postures and hesitancies that they are holding back massive resentments.Indeed, it is not clear how interested director Rudy Valdez is in Santana, or whether he is just doing this gig as a means to an end. Valdez\u2019s filmography is filled with works that sound a lot more hard-hitting and social justice-oriented than this behind-the-music fluff. Even so, Valdez gets the job done, laying down a constant soundtrack of Santana\u2019s music in the background that (to be honest) sounds like variations on the same theme over and over again at slightly different speeds. No mention is made of the most controversial thing Santana has done recently, which was to say on stage that transgender people should stay \u201cin the closet\u201d, remarks for which he has since apologised. Carlos: The Santana Journey is showing on 23 and 27 September in UK and Irish cinemas.","133":"Social media, for all its sins, has achieved at least one thing in this crazy, mixed-up world: it\u2019s raised everyone\u2019s game when it comes to cat videos. What artist Louis Wain did for cat illustration in the 19th century, YouTube, Instagram and TikTok have done for our feline friends in the 21st, celebrating their strangeness, comic absurdity, and capacity for grumpiness. Meanwhile, there\u2019s a growing genre of documentary films about cats and their relationship with humans, some of which add to the cat-people Venn-diagram-overlap an extra subset concerned with specific places, such as the magnificent Kedi, which profiled the street cats of Istanbul and their human friends.Cats of Malta, as its unambiguous title suggests, wants to do for Malta what Kedi did for Istanbul. It celebrates these very territorial creatures that share the streets of ancient neighbourhoods, with their history recounted by director Sarah Jayne\u2019s voiceover. The cats are mostly unconcerned with the human residents except when they have needs to be met, such as hunger or medical emergencies. And so we get stories told straight to camera by kindly humans who had to help when, for example, an aggressive kick by a passing dog owner ended up costing one tom a front leg. Another person created a little cat village next to a historic stretch of wall built by the Knights Templar \u2013 a lovely conjunction of antiquity and super-tacky plastic cat shelters \u2013 but was forced to take it down by developers with plans for the site. Many of the humans, including the cat-village builder, English-Maltese actor Polly Marsh and 13-year-old natural comic Isaac Muscat, voluntarily spend huge chunks of their free time feeding the cats. They also, when possible, trap them so that they can be neutered or spayed, thus reducing the feral population.Most of the subjects talk about how much the cats give back by, for example, helping people lower their heart rates and blood pressure through relaxing cuddles, as if any cat fan watching this needed to be persuaded. There\u2019s a proselytising quality at times that may baffle already-converted viewers but perhaps the film-makers are trying to persuade less pro-cat members of the audience to be more compassionate. Indeed, the film\u2019s tone and purpose are a little hazy at times, making this not as satisfying as spending a good hour browsing cat memes, but it is still soft, fuzzy and purr-inducing. Also there\u2019s a fantastic bit where a cat, captured in a cage to visit the vet, makes a meow that basically sounds like he\u2019s saying \u201cNo! No!\u201d Genuinely hilarious. Cats of Malta is released on 25 September on digital platforms.","134":"Here is a brittle and contrived but rather elegant Brit thriller about literary paranoia from debut feature screenwriter Alex MacKeith and director Alice Troughton, herself a cinema first-timer having had much acclaim working on TV. The upscale and sophisticated mise-en-sc\u00e8ne is rather French; Julie Delpy has a role here and looks quite at home.Richard E Grant plays JM Sinclair, a bestselling, sharp-tongued author who gives roguish interviews repeating the old maxim that good artists borrow but great ones steal. He is married to art collector H\u00e9l\u00e8ne (Delpy) and they live in a handsome country estate with extensive grounds and a lake. But Sinclair, usually so prolific, has retreated to a haunted creative silence following the tragic death of his elder son; the parents are now concerned with moody and mercurial younger boy Bertie (Stephen McMillan) who needs to be coached to get a place at Oxford to read English.And so they engage a live-in tutor to give lessons: this is Liam (Daryl McCormack), whose charm engages his employers. Liam finds himself having dinner with the family wearing borrowed clothes belonging to the dead son. But more painfully still, Liam admires Sinclair because he is a would-be author himself, and tremulously shows him his first novel in manuscript \u2013 with calamitous results.I enjoyed the \u201clesson\u201d scenes here, especially when Liam has to provide a reading list. (My reading list for this film would be: John Colapinto\u2019s About the Author, Jean Hanff Korelitz\u2019s The Plot, Rebecca F Kuang\u2019s Yellowface and James Hadley Chase\u2019s Eve.) As for McCormack, he has the same screen presence he showed playing opposite Emma Thompson in the comedy Good Luck to You, Leo Grande \u2013 a not dissimilar role, in fact. Yet here he has to be angry, vengeful and infatuated, and the role certainly tests his emotional range pretty severely. Well, it\u2019s hard not to be upstaged when matched with Richard E Grant in full flight. An amusing essay in conceit and revenge. The Lesson is released on 22 September in UK cinemas.","135":"There\u2019s a swirl of the old and the new in the hokey pre-Halloween horror It Lives Inside, a balance that could have benefited from a lot more of the latter \u2013 because when the first-time director Bishal Dutta does try to add freshness to the familiarity of formula, he manages to carve his film its own place within two overstuffed subgenres, flashes of intrigue as he veers between schlocky curse and even schlockier monster movie.A wide-releasing horror film centered on an Indian American teenager already gives the film a certain distinction. Dutta, also acting as writer, tries to thread themes of assimilation and identity through a predictable procession of mostly ineffective jump scares and slightly more effective set pieces, the film working better when it\u2019s trying to chill rather than shock. Never Have I Ever and Missing\u2019s Megan Suri plays Samidha, or Sam as she prefers to be called, a girl trying to fit in at a predominantly white high school despite her mother keenly trying to keep traditions an integral part of her life. It\u2019s led to a distance from her other Indian American friend, Tamira and, like Heathers and Fright Night before it, explores that interesting fracture of leaving one friend behind to climb higher socially.Tamira\u2019s increasingly strange behaviour both unsettles and annoys Sam, as she skulks around unkempt and insistent that something sinister is afoot. But when she goes missing, it\u2019s clear that she was right about a curse that attaches itself to those with a certain heritage.It\u2019s a demonic spirit called a Pishach, one that appears in Hindu mythology, but one that\u2019s ultimately a variation on something that\u2019s appeared in a multitude of horror films before. It sticks to the dark, feeds on both flesh and fear and haunts the nightmares of those next in line. When the creature is kept to mostly sound design, as unoriginal as the noises may be, it\u2019s a far more successful spectre. But as is frequently the case, the more we see, the less we want to and when we get the full picture, it most closely resembles the ill-advised human-alien hybrid from the end of Alien: Resurrection, snorts of derision cancelling out any screams.Telling a story of a flesh-eating demon but working with a PG-13 rating, the film is neutered from the outset but Dutta\u2019s sleek, menacing atmosphere and efficient use of darkness almost make up for it, his film nothing if not a convincing audition tape for bigger genre work. His script might falter at times (Sam\u2019s poor mother\u2019s middle name may well be exposition) but it\u2019s in the more specific moments that some character emerges, difficult and unanswered questions surrounding immigrant guilt and cultural reinvention adding much-needed texture to the more rote horror plotting.Some of Dutta\u2019s of-the-moment metaphor horror might be blunt but it\u2019s also, in some scenes, bluntly effective as well as effectively dour, his film climaxing with an unsurprising yet unnerving endnote. In the brief moments when It Lives Inside finds itself, there\u2019s reason to believe Dutta will unearth more next time \u2013 he might just have to dig a little deeper.It Lives Inside is out in US cinemas on 22 September and in the UK on 20 October","136":"The contrast between Kenneth Branagh\u2019s latest Poirot adventure, the enjoyably spooky mystery A Haunting in Venice, and the synthetic fakery of the previous instalment, Death on the Nile, could be used as a case study of the power of casting to make or break a movie. The essential ingredients are the same: Agatha Christie source material; the timeworn formula of a murder or two in an impossibly lavish location, followed by a whole mess of conflicting motivations to untangle. Branagh brings exactly the same degree of prissy, moustache-fondling affectation to his performance as the Belgian master detective. But this time he smartly casts actors who are able to disappear into their characters \u2013 Tina Fey, with her staccato, typewriter line delivery as crime novelist Ariadne Oliver; Kelly Reilly\u2019s silky, luxuriant sadness as celebrated singer Rowena Drake. Compare that with Nile\u2019s distractingly starry cast of actors self-consciously wearing their roles: garish fancy dress costumes rather than characters.Another plus is the atmospheric Venice backdrop, its murky, swirling waters hinting at dark secrets that accumulate over centuries, like barnacles clinging doggedly to the buildings; its extravagant beauty framed slightly off-kilter. The story itself is fairly formulaic: Poirot is tempted by the opportunity to debunk Michelle Yeoh\u2019s society medium at a Halloween seance, but soon finds himself sock-suspender-deep in bodies. It\u2019s enjoyable, if familiar. A special mention should go to Jude Hill, the child actor who played Branagh\u2019s younger self in Belfast and here shows impressive range with a deliciously unsettling turn as Leopold, the son of a shell-shocked and half-broken father.","137":"Most animated features are designed to be exported to countries all over the world, the voice track redubbed for each local market to add flavour and ensure the kids don\u2019t have to read subtitles. Likewise, having the characters incarnated by talking animals (a tradition dating back to the earliest days of animation), is another handy way to deracialise the material. This way, anyone anywhere watching the same movie can relate to the heroic dog or rabbit or whoever as they go about learning about the value of family or the importance of friendship in a fantasy landscape that bears little resemblance to our actual planet.This one, apparently a multinational effort judging by its end credits and production companies, weirdly both conforms to and breaks those rules. Yes, all the characters in it are non-human animals, starting with the slow loris hero, Zhi (voiced by Jimmy O Yang) who longs to be a race-car driver despite resistance from his grandmother guardian (Lisa Lu) \u2013 she would prefer him to spend all day learning tai chi. The baddie is a frog racer named Archie Vainglorious (John Cleese, sounding husky these days), the key helper a goat named Gnash (JK Simmons, doing a very weird American-Swedish accent), and the love interest is another slow loris named Shelby (Chloe Bennet).So far, so traditionally anthropomorphic. But at the same time, there\u2019s lots of discussion of Chinese and Asian heritage, what with the big race Zhi competes in being called the Silk Road Rally, a wacky race that ends in a cartoon facsimile of Shanghai. Elsewhere we have pregnant male seahorses with Italian accents, and some kind of weasel creature with a cockney accent who, when they\u2019re trying to help Zhi beat Vainglorious, pulls a lever inside their vehicle labelled \u201cBrexit\u201d that releases, pointlessly, an avalanche of teapots to thwart those behind there vehicle.That last bit was one of the better jokes, while the other chuckles are mostly delivered via the patter from one of the peripheral characters, an Icelandic reindeer voiced by Catherine Tate. There\u2019s also a well-drawn but narratively inexplicable spoof of the Norwegian band a-ha\u2019s classic Take on Me video, although it\u2019s doubtful any of the younger viewers will get the reference. This is very bizarre stuff, even within the traditionally weird parameters of cultural representation in cartoons, but kids won\u2019t mind as it\u2019s one non-stop riot of colour and vroom-vroom movement. This article was amended on 16 September 2023. The band a-ha are from Norway, not Sweden as an earlier version said. Rally Road Racers is released on 15 September in UK and Irish cinemas.","138":"Of all the autumn film festivals, Toronto was always going to be the one that stood to lose the most from the strikes that are paralysing much of the film industry. For a public-facing event that is justly famous for the rapturously enthusiastic audience response to its celebratory gala screening events, the absence of actors because of the Sag-Aftra union action would be particularly keenly felt. After all, without a sprinkling of stars, a red carpet is just an impractically coloured floor covering.There was speculation among those attending the festival that the unusually high number of films by actors turned directors this year was in part a strategy to circumvent the rules of the strike (unless an interim agreement has been put in place, actors are prevented from promoting their films, but no such restrictions are enforced for directors). The roster of these films included the feature-directing debuts of Chris Pine, Anna Kendrick, Kristin Scott Thomas and Patricia Arquette, plus features from more experienced actor-directors such as Taika Waititi (who won the audience prize, the People\u2019s Choice, for Jojo Rabbit in 2019), Viggo Mortensen, Ethan Hawke and Michael Keaton.If indeed it was a strategy, it rather backfired. Interim agreements meant that Mortensen and star Vicky Krieps were able to attend to promote their film, the handsomely brooding frontier-set love story The Dead Don\u2019t Hurt, and Hawke was in town to support his film, Wildcat, a formally daring exploration of the life and work of the writer Flannery O\u2019Connor (flight cancellations forced Hawke to take an 11-hour Greyhound bus from New York to Toronto). But other film-makers stayed away in solidarity. And that\u2019s before you even get to the wildly uneven quality of some of the other actor-turned-director offerings, with the pictures by Keaton, Arquette, Scott Thomas and Pine drawing less than enthusiastic responses from critics.The exception was the buzzy early festival standout Woman of the Hour, a deftly directed debut from Kendrick (who also stars) that announces her as a film-making talent to be reckoned with. Set in the early 1970s, the film takes as its jumping-off point a real event: the appearance of serial killer Rodney Alcala (Daniel Zovatto) on the popular TV show The Dating Game. Kendrick stars as Cheryl Bradshaw, the struggling actor who is convinced by her agent to take part in the show, and who finds herself trading innuendo-heavy televised small talk with a man who is later revealed to be a mass murderer and rapist. It\u2019s a tonal challenge, but one to which Kendrick rises admirably.Sparks of increasingly bitter humour punctuate the growing sense of dread as Alcala charms his way out of suspicion. Cheryl, meanwhile, is adept at the daily microcalculations and dancing around the sensitive egos of the men she meets. The attention to period detail goes beyond the peppy colour palette and the flammable synthetics in the wardrobe, digging into the enraging sexual politics of the era.Another period picture that confronts the baked-in sexism of the time is the deliciously foul-mouthed and funny Wicked Little Letters, a 1920s-set tale about a spate of poison pen letters that rock the coastal community of Littlehampton, Sussex. Olivia Colman is the simpering, saintly recipient of the missives; Jessie Buckley is the rambunctious Irish single mum who is suspected of sending them. Both are an absolute blast in this terrific comedy.There were disappointments: The Critic, starring a venomous Ian McKellen as a monstrous theatre critic, started well but unravelled into chaos. And one of the hottest tickets of the festival, Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s latest (and possibly last) animation, The Boy and the Heron, was sporadically charming and gorgeous, but also uneven and overplotted.Toronto has always been a launch pad for awards contenders, and this year was no exception. Expect Jamie Foxx to figure prominently in best actor conversations for his force-of-nature turn as showboating lawyer Willie E Gary in the crowd-pleasing courtroom drama The Burial. Both Annette Bening, who trained for more than a year to play the endurance swimmer Diana Nyad, and Jodie Foster, who brings heart and humour to the role of her best friend, Bonnie, should be in with a chance for the biopic Nyad, the narrative film debut of documentarians Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (Free Solo).But the serious contender in all categories, and by no small margin the best film of the festival, is The Holdovers, by Alexander Payne. It\u2019s not just a return to form for the American director, whose last picture was the disappointing curio Downsizing in 2017. This 1970s-set comedy drama easily matches the very best films of Payne\u2019s career. It explores the bond between a cantankerous teacher at an elite boarding school (Paul Giamatti) and an abrasive teenage student (Dominic Sessa) who is forced to spend the winter break at school.The treasures might have been fewer and further between this edition of the festival, in what can\u2019t, by any stretch of the imagination, be considered a banner year. Ultimately, that makes gems such as The Holdovers all the more precious.Best filmAlexander Payne\u2019s The Holdovers.Best lead performancesJamie Foxx\u2019s charisma tsunami in the courtroom drama The Burial; Jodie Comer\u2019s delicate, mesmerising turn in the dystopian survival film The End We Start From, from debut British director Mahalia Belo.Best supporting performancesDa\u2019Vine Joy Randolph, devastatingly good in The Holdovers; Jodie Foster in the swimming biopic Nyad.Best newcomerDominic Sessa in The Holdovers.Longest introTaika Waititi performed a comedy routine, got into a punch-up with his microphone and invited a Native American elder on stage to perform a blessing before the premiere of Next Goal Wins.Longest queueThe line for the press screening of Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s The Boy and the Heron stretched several blocks an hour before the film was due to start.Best swearingOlivia Colman and Jessie Buckley, turning the air blue in the 1920s-set comedy Wicked Little Letters.","139":"The hoary sub-genre that is \u201cattractive American tourists find something nefarious on their travels\u201d is given a vigorous polish in thoughtful thriller The Royal Hotel, a film light on exploitation and heavy on interrogation.It\u2019s an intriguing follow-up for writer-director Kitty Green, whose last film The Assistant was a simple yet stinging drama about a young woman, played by Julia Garner, working, and cleaning up, for a predatory Weinstein-like figure. Green\u2019s approach to the subject was defter than most, an unusual way into a story most of us already knew far too much about, and there\u2019s a similar sensitivity here for the most part, grounding a potentially schlocky situation. Garner returns as Hanna, joined by Glass Onion\u2019s Jessica Henwick as Liv, two women running out of money on their travels in Australia, forced to take whatever work is available. Their only option is a pub in a remote mining community, run by Hugo Weaving\u2019s crotchety inebriate, with no wifi but plenty of horny locals.Green\u2019s uneasy slow-burn as the two women smile off an escalation of misogynistic microaggressions, is rooted and believable (it\u2019s loosely based on a 2017 documentary), a forced playfulness with their lairy clientele a necessary tool of survival. It\u2019s a perceptive look at the realities of working at a service job as an outsider when class and gender come into play, and the difficulties of performance that then leads to, an impossible modulation, role-playing on a knife-edge. The two British women who came before them, drunkenly passing the baton, show a more permissive attitude, playing along with a brash lack of sexual inhibition but the new pair are less comfortable with the dynamic, Hanna quickly painted as the party-pooper, a tiresome procession of men just asking her to smile more.Despite the increasing ugliness of the situation, the script, from Green and Oscar Redding, avoids the broadest of strokes, showing us specific variations in the men they encounter, that trouble can come in many forms, some of it more tolerable yet all of it exhausting. It can also come in more initially deceptive packaging, such as Babyteeth star Luke Holland\u2019s handsome flirt and one of the film\u2019s most horribly well-orchestrated moments is an aborted alcohol-fueled sex scene with him and Garner, reminiscent of the one in the film adaptation of Cat Person. Both scenes carry uncomfortable and unfairly imbalanced questions \u2013 why am I here, is this my fault, what should I do, what do I owe someone, how do I get out safely \u2013 and it\u2019s in these chillier moments that the film really gets under the skin.But like that film it also loses its power as it thunders towards a spotty finale, not quite as dramatically here, but the initial tension, of which there was so much, dissipates as the film struggles to figure out how far it should lean into its genre trappings. The decision-making becomes harder to justify, the circumstances become harder to believe and the final punch of an ending becomes impossible to buy, a bravura visual (the film looks sensational throughout) but one that would only make sense had the film really gone full thriller. Garner and Henwick are never anything less than convincing, the latter especially, and the film is often at its most interesting when exploring the tiring dynamic of being the responsible friend. I\u2019d argue the last act could have benefited from more of this knottiness but it\u2019s more texture than one would usually find in a film such as this.It\u2019s this trap though that becomes a blessing and curse, the film so much better than most \u2018tourists find trouble abroad\u2019 horrors yet at times thinner and less believable than a drama in the same setting. It\u2019s everything and nothing at once although for a while, it\u2019s really something.The Royal Hotel is screening at the Toronto film festival and will be out in US cinemas on 6 October","140":"We\u2019re in the middle of this year\u2019s fall festival season which also means that we\u2019re starting this year\u2019s Oscar season which, as ever, then means that we\u2019re in the thick of the dreaded biopic season. Films about Priscilla Presley, Leonard Bernstein, Enzo Ferrari, Nicholas Winton and Lee Miller are all trying to add fresh dynamism to the facts and figures of biographies, a practice that more often than not, feels rather thankless. Or at least it does to us as viewers. Academy members and actors trying to impress Academy members might disagree, the last decade offering up 15 acting Oscars to those playing dress-up as real people.What marks Netflix\u2019s Oscar play Rustin out, at least on initial scan, is its focus on the kind of person who isn\u2019t usually afforded a place in this particular spotlight, a gay Black man whose story hasn\u2019t trickled down to as many of us as it should have. Even at the time, in the fraught early 60s, the life and work of Bayard Rustin was being diminished, his contributions too often outweighed by bigotry over his sexuality. Played by Colman Domingo, an actor finally receiving his leading man due, Rustin is a tireless activist, fighting alongside his close friend Martin Luther King Jr (a note-perfect Aml Ameen). But childish rumours about their relationship, started and maintained by their peers, led to public controversy and a rift in their friendship.Hurt by what he sees as a betrayal by his friend but still plagued by the grim cycle of anti-Black violence of the time, Rustin wanted to make a statement, with or without King\u2019s help, and decided to plan a march, uniting those from across the country who were as tired as he, descending on the Capitol in their thousands. The film follows his dogged journey to make it happen, in the space of mere weeks, as others within the movement continue to undermine him.While an increasing number of writers and film-makers are arming themselves with a hyper-awareness of the biopic\u2019s cliches and pitfalls, trying to upend expectations with unexpected tweaks, the makers of Rustin are content to stay within strict formula. It\u2019s understandable for the most part, given how little many know of Rustin\u2019s work, but at other times it can give the film a parodic quality (not helped by the distracting appearance of Chris Rock as Roy Wilkins). Julian Breece and Dustin Lance Black\u2019s ho-hum screenplay relies a little too heavily on clumsy exposition and there\u2019s an inconsistent and distracting choice to add names and job titles of characters on screen as they\u2019re introduced. It\u2019s also not helped by the static quality of George C Wolfe\u2019s direction and that, coupled with the trademark Netflix cheapness, gives some of it the feeling of a History Channel re-enactment.It\u2019s when the script leans into the story\u2019s specificities that the film is at its most compelling \u2013 when intersectionality causes ruptures within the group, when we see civil rights giants fail to understand the hypocrisy of their homophobic bigotry, how Rustin manages his queerness in public and in private \u2013 and these moments help to provide depth to some of the flatness that\u2019s in the more standard-issue scenes. Even when the film is playing it as safe as can be, the bare bones of the story are so undeniably impressive that it\u2019s hard not to feel moved by what was achieved, a feeling that\u2019s also largely down to Domingo\u2019s all-guns-blazing performance. He nails the charming persuasiveness that would explain how Rustin achieved so much in such a short amount of time and as he slowly starts to experience a level of acceptance for his whole self, rather than handpicked parts, there\u2019s a genuine poignancy to watching him crumble in front of us, a weight we can feel being lifted away.While the scale of the big finale is hampered by budgetary constraints, it\u2019s an effectively stirring endnote regardless, even if it might be Domingo\u2019s hand pulling the strings. Rustin screened at the Toronto film festival; it is released in US and UK cinemas on 3 November, and on Netflix on 17 November.","141":"Inspired by an online challenge that went viral nearly a decade ago, Rebekah McKendry\u2019s second feature feels out of date from start to finish. The central game is simple: one must enter the lift of a 10-floor building and proceed to travel in a specific sequence through a series of floors, the last of which supposedly opens a portal to a dangerous parallel world. The trick here is to close your eyes, or risk being torn to pieces by a mysterious apparition referred to as \u201cthe woman on the fifth floor\u201d.Such a scenario is ripe with potential for world-building details and creative designs, but there is little visual flair on show here. A group of popular vloggers head to a notorious lift where a girl has gone missing after attempting the perilous challenge, but the generic location is as inspiring and memorable as a doctor\u2019s waiting room. Mentions of TikTok accounts suggest that Elevator Game takes place in the present, yet the vloggers are lugging huge shoulder camcorders about as if it\u2019s two decades ago. Plastered with sepia-toned filters and juvenile sound effects, the snippets of these characters\u2019 supposedly popular videos betray a lack of awareness of current online culture. It is no wonder that the dialogue rings so stilted, like a parody of how older writers imagine Gen Z-ers speak.Cardboard characters aside, Elevator Game is also pretty sluggish, despite its relatively short runtime. Plodding through an endless string of dull shot\/reverse shots between the quarrelling vloggers, the film finally reaches the dreaded fifth floor, but the payoff is tame and bloodless. With a bit with red lighting and a few jumpscares, this much-discussed other realm \u2013 and consequently the movie as a whole \u2013 are, ultimately, hardly worth the fuss. Elevator Game is available from 15 September on Shudder.","142":"This Wales, Liverpool and London-set drama is a proper melodrama any way you slice it, but one with strong enough performances and sufficiently good dialogue to keep it from feeling tacky. The first chunk of expository scene-setting shuttles back and forth between the 1970s and the present day, establishing a sunny comic tone that\u2019s suddenly pierced by tragedy. In the 70s, a coachload of kids from a children\u2019s home are travelling to see their favourite band, T Rex, chaperoned by the home\u2019s vicar (Andrew Lancel) and cheery carer Simon (Louis Emerick, forever lovable Mick from Brookside). The vicar\u2019s daughter Penny (Eden Beach), about 10 years old, is close with home-resident Sadie (Amelia Rose Smith) and Sadie\u2019s shy older brother Jimmy (Isaac Lancel-Watkinson), who is bullied by the older boys. The coach ends up crashing, killing several people. Meanwhile, in the present, adult Penny (Leanne Best, so good you wonder why she\u2019s not had more leading roles instead of support turns) is now married to local vicar Geraint (Mark Lewis Jones) and is excitedly preparing to make her annual pilgrimage from Anglesey to London to pay respects at the grave of T Rex\u2019s lead singer, Marc Bolan, whom the kids all met back in the 1970s timeline.However, at the graveside where many T Rex fans have gathered, Penny notices a withdrawn man (Timothy Spall, for it is he) with long hair and a huge beard, blowing massive bubbles for entertainment. He has an epileptic fit; of course, it transpires that this is Jimmy, who years earlier was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and these days lives in a ramshackle mobile home in the woods. He hasn\u2019t been in a good way ever since the aforementioned tragedy back in the 1970s. Once he and Penny are reunited, all that walled-up pain, guilt and shame comes out in a flood of long-kept secrets, most of them revealed in a long, movingly delivered monologue from Penny. So persuasive is Best\u2019s performance that you almost don\u2019t notice writer-director Ian Puleston-Davies stacks the revelation of yet another tragic horror atop the pile \u2013 as if separated siblings, secret identities, bullied children in care, horrible accidents and Bolan\u2019s death weren\u2019t enough.The happy-ish ending doesn\u2019t feel entirely persuasive but it\u2019s just about forgivable, and Spall is every bit as good as Best in a role that many other actors might have hammed up with broader gestures and mannerisms. Instead, Spall keeps the performance tight, projecting not just Jimmy\u2019s damaged psyche but also his wit. You can\u2019t help but chuckle when he mentions he spent a lot of time in Bristol: \u201cLovely city, shame about the slavery.\u201d Bolan\u2019s Shoes is released on 15 September in UK and Irish cinemas.","143":"John Wick has probably created unrealistic expectations for the adrenaline levels to be encountered in luxury hospitality venues, and this low-budget super-soldier thriller, largely narrated over cocktails in a swanky hotel lobby, follows firmly in its gold-card wake. But the generic and strangely pointless tech conspiracy on offer here supplies as memorable an experience as a branch of the average Hilton. And despite its attempts to juice up its cyborg setup with some old-fashioned body heat, Dark Asset ends up more smarmy than sexy.Former special forces soldier (Byron Mann) is fitted out with a cybernetic enhancement chip and a John Doe moniker, the latest recruit in an experimental programme. Once the chip has been activated by boffin Dr Cain (Robert Patrick, who has acquired fiendish eyebrows since his Terminator 2 days), he has access to enhanced cognitive and physiological abilities. But the hardware malfunctions, and John busts out of the secure facility and heads not for the nearest casino (surprisingly given his card-divining capability), but to a hotel where he cracks on to Jane (Helena Mattsson) and insists he has quite the tale to tell.Never mind the bodyhacking, this combination of action thriller and Scheherazade-style raconteuring is an unstable hybrid as John proceeds to recount the stories of the enhanced operatives who came before him. It\u2019s admirably ambitious on the part of writer-director Michael Winnick, but the two approaches are fundamentally at odds with each other; the nested narratives sap the relentless forward momentum needed, and the individual flashbacks are not compelling enough set-pieces on either the action or character front. The tricksy structure needs greater intrigue to justify it, but with the programme apparently being at the behest of a cabal of anonymous businessmen, it\u2019s not even as fleshed-out as Universal Soldier.Mann does look fantastic \u2013 lean and dapper \u2013 but his chip appears to be malfunctioning in his scenes opposite Mattsson; a smug grin is virtually his only facial expression. Both leads also consistently opt for the \u201ccheesy dialogue\u201d option in their head-up displays. Dark Asset finally finds a semi-satisfying groove as John\u2019s grand design is revealed, even if it consists of too many borrowed parts to be a real quantum leap. Dark Asset is available on digital platforms on 18 September.","144":"It seems strange that an actor of Anthony Hopkins\u2019 prestige and acclaim would need a comeback so late in his career but for a few years, the Oscar-winner was stuck in a cycle of thankless sequel paycheques and one-word thrillers where the \u201cand\u201d credit was starting to lose its lustre (Collide! Solace! Misconduct! Blackway!). Within the space of a year he was then Oscar nominated for The Two Popes and won for The Father (his first Academy attention since 1998) and while it didn\u2019t exactly curb his predilection for B-movies completely (in 2021 he started in Zero Contact, the first film to be released by an NFT platform), it did edge him back toward substance, with a subtle yet scene-devouring turn in James Gray\u2019s Armageddon Time and now, another knockout performance in the second world war drama One Life.The film might, at times, feel more like a BBC TV drama (it does come from BBC Films among others) with some pedestrian film-making touches but it builds towards a last act of towering emotion, with few dry eyes at its Toronto film festival premiere. It\u2019s a story of radical bravery, of Nicholas Winton, a stockbroker gripped by a need to do something as Europe neared the start of the second world war. He headed to Prague in 1938, despite the cautions of his well-intentioned mother, and found himself immediately horrified by the situation so many of the young refugees were in, most unlikely to survive the winter. His plan to save them was dismissed as naive by those more hardened by what they had seen and what they had found not to be possible but he returned to London determined to help and with the assistance of his equally dogged mother, he started gathering visas and finding homes.We see his work play out via flashbacks as the elder Winton sorts through files and papers he\u2019s long been hoarding, much to the chagrin of his wife. Played by Johnny Flynn as a youth, he\u2019s a man driven by an unstoppable need to help and as his older self, played by Hopkins, he\u2019s a man haunted by never helping enough. Embarrassed by the idea of demanding attention for what he had done, he learned to almost bury it, telling himself that anyone would have acted in the same way and that thinking too much about it would cause him to focus on those who were left behind.It\u2019s an involving back-and-forth through time but in the scenes from the late 30s, small screen director James Hawes often struggles to visually distinguish his film from so many second world war dramas that have come before, reverting to the safety of his TV roots. Flynn is a convincingly obsessive problem-solver, with help from a steely Romola Garai in Prague (someone please give her a legal procedural already) and a tenacious Helena Bonham-Carter as his mother in London, and there\u2019s an undeniable wrench from the familiar yet poignant images of little hands waving goodbye to parents they\u2019re never going to see again. But it\u2019s in the scenes from the late 80s, which slowly start to take centre stage, that the film finds more original footing, exploring with nuance the realities of living with the weight of doing so much yet thinking of it as so little.Winton\u2019s monumental accomplishment was kept hidden for years, buried away in a leather briefcase in his home, and as he slowly tries to find a way to share the documents that detail what he did (for historical and educational purposes rather than for anything involving his ego), his life and self-perception start to shift. It\u2019s in these latter scenes, as Winton confronts his innate goodness and realises the weight of what he\u2019s done, that the film truly soars. Key moments take place at recordings of BBC\u2019s That\u2019s Life, a show his wife laughs off as tacky, but there\u2019s something about its unashamed sentimentality that starts to have an effect, suddenly hitting us as it does Hopkins, whose display of unearthed emotion is rather shattering, a man never thinking of himself as good enough finally realising he\u2019s better than most of us. It\u2019s a last act that brought down the house here in Toronto and will likely do the same upon release.One Life is screening at the Toronto film festival and will be released in the UK on 5 January with a US release to be announced","145":"A door bursts open, a man hurtles across the screen, overturning a table in pursuit of some vanishing figure. A door bursts open, and a woman slams it hard against whoever is chasing behind her. A door opens more slowly, a face peering anxiously round it, eyes widening with astonishment. Just as you are about to see who or what they saw, the door closes with a click. A key turns sharply in the lock.Swiss-American artist Christian Marclay\u2019s Doors is all revelation and drama. For almost an hour, the viewer sits spellbound in a darkened cinema specially created for the film\u2019s UK premiere at White Cube, watching a nonstop onslaught of entrances and exits. Clip after clip, selected from hundreds of movies, appears on the big screen in an extraordinary feat of choreography and collage. Somehow, it seems as if each is directly connected to the next, no matter that they shift between monochrome and colour, and all the way from silent films to French New Wave and Hollywood blockbuster.Ingrid Bergman, Sidney Poitier, Bette Davis, Bill Murray \u2013 they arrive and they depart, every time through a door. John Wayne saunters in, with a searching look, Robert Mitchum rushes angrily through, John Travolta breaks out into the night through the exit.Each door marks an edit point, and every edit is so deft that the actors always appear to be on their way to the very next scene. One door opens and a new film begins. Mia Farrow looks through a keyhole, in Rosemary\u2019s Baby, and what she sees is a nightmare from a completely different movie. Rita Hayworth, in glamorous gown, goes to answer the door and it opens into another film.A double locking of the door is shown in Hitchcockian closeup. Or a door being slyly locked with the use of a blade, so that it does not appear is if anyone\u2019s broken in. A door swings open to reveal a gift left inside an apartment. It creaks, opens of its own accord, slams alarmingly shut. No actors are needed when the door has become the protagonist.Suddenly you notice the same scene reappearing: perhaps this is where you came in, and Marclay\u2019s film is beginning again? But then the scene turns out to be very slightly longer, offering fractionally more narrative, before it cedes to the next clip. This creates a pleasingly piquant unease for audiences used to watching art films on loop. For this is by no means the end.Marclay (born 1955) is famous for his timing, specifically for 2010\u2019s The Clock, featuring watches, clocks and characters reacting to them in thousands of collaged clips. That 24-hour wonderwork was synchronised to real time in the many museums where it was shown, so that when Robert De Niro checked his Rolex at 2.03pm, it really was 2.03pm. The viewer was outside time, watching the film, and yet positioned within it, always reminded of its ticking reality on the screen.Those refined calculations extend to sound here too; each door opens into a new space and time, but also into a new soundscape. Heavy breathing merges into panting, dramatic music into screaming violins, which cross-fade with storms. You soon realise, too, that film-makers rarely show a door closing when they can imply it through sound instead.Marclay\u2019s film exceeds the encyclopedic labours of its own making in every respect. Even as it crystallises the role of doors in cinema \u2013 all the ways they are used to begin or end a scene, to ratchet suspense, or orchestrate rhythm \u2013 so it builds into its own self-contained movie per se. Ten years in the making, its own rhythm is so subtle it seems to press forwards in perpetuity. The door never shuts, you might say.Marclay is a terrific manipulator of emotion and tension. His film moves through the ominous arrival of the doctor at the bedside or the lawyer at the prison cell, from the awful tension of a gradually opening door to the urgent wait for the lift doors to part with a view of safety (or its opposite) for a fleeing figure. Every clip is perfectly choreographed, and timed, to sustain our never-ending sense of anticipation.This exhibition also includes a series of new sculptures constructed from old doors. A door gnawed away to its frame, without panels or fittings: the ghost of a door, as it seems, or has it now become a window? An infinite column of lock panels that rises to the ceiling. The central architecture of a door, cut to a cross shape, so that it becomes a crucifix, the knocker where a human head might be.Best of all, in these \u201calterations\u201d, as Marclay modestly calls them, is a horizontal stack of doors with fractional gaps between them. The irresistible impulse is to kneel down and peer through, like the child you have just seen in Marclay\u2019s film, trying to understand the world by looking through a letterbox.Which is, in the end, what this marvellous show is about: not just doors in films, or even doors in reality, but the curious role of these curious and intermediary objects in our existence. Doors become newly emblematic in Marclay\u2019s art. They speak of everyone who might come or go through them, every before and after, everything seen and unseen in some scenario or story. Above all, they stand for our constant desire to know what happens next.

Top billing goes to Jho Low, a Great Gatsby figure who, in cahoots with Goldman Sachs bankers and Malaysia\u2019s former PM, is accused of swindling the country\u2019s poorest out of some $1.42bn and is now on the run. He spent the money sucking up to Hollywood A-listers with lavish gifts and funding for the DiCaprio-starring movie The Wolf of Wall Street. Apt, since this documentary shares Scorsese\u2019s theme of obscene greed, while Kuala Lumpur\u2019s neon nightscape gives the feel of a Batman villain\u2019s origin story. The Penguin, probably.","147":"After the ethereal, English-language Spencer, Chilean director Pablo Larra\u00edn returns home with this gothic monochrome alt-history, imagining murderous dictator General Pinochet as a 250-year-old vampire. Having faked his death, Pinochet (Jaime Vadell), AKA El Conde, is hiding out in the crumbling grandeur of his Patagonian lair, hoping for death. This end-of-life ennui is disturbed by his money-grubbing family, not-so-loyal servant (Alfredo Castro) and a comely accountant-nun (Paula Luchsinger).All are entertaining in turn, though none manages to drive a stake through the dark heart of Larra\u00edn\u2019s often enigmatic political point. It\u2019s down to the arch, instantly recognisable narration to really skewer crony-capitalism, while Larra\u00edn\u2019s film demonstrates a palate for mordant humour as refined as the count\u2019s taste for blood.On Netflix","148":"Purported to be the master Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s last movie, maybe, The Boy and the Heron is a gentler and slower though no less soulful addition to his canon. The film, about a young boy slipping like so many Miyazaki protagonists to a world unencumbered by mortality, takes its time to get going. Meanwhile, it\u2019s preoccupied with those who have no time left.It\u2019s a fittingly solemn swan song for the 82-year-old film-maker who \u2013 with films like My Neighbor Totoro and Spirited Away \u2013 has taken us to magical worlds where human and animal anatomies are free to make exchanges while industry and nature become harmonious in ungodly ways. The catbus in Totoro always struck me as a cuddly response to a Cronenberg monster.The Boy and the Heron, the director\u2019s first feature since he last retired with 2013\u2019s The Wind Rises, has all the Miyazaki hallmarks: the anthropomorphic animals, the tiny grannies with disproportionate facial features who can just as easily be magical creatures and a tempting food scene \u2013 animated jam looks ready to drip off the screen. Miyazaki has few surprises left, but in The Boy and the Heron, it\u2019s the familiar that feels like a comforting hug.The film is already a box office hit in Japan, where it was released in July with no advance promotion \u2013 as if in secret. The Japanese title is How Do You Live?, taken from Genzaburo Yoshino\u2019s 1937 novel. Yohino\u2019s book appears in The Boy and The Heron, a text the film\u2019s young protagonist Mahito (Soma Santoki), who is somewhat inspired by Miyazaki himself, picks up and reads during a pivotal moment.The film gets going with an evocative, harrowing and dream-like cold open. Sirens breaking the silence at the dead of night before ashes and embers float into the frame. It\u2019s the second world war. A Tokyo hospital has been firebombed and Mahito realizes his mother is on shift. The frame captures his mad scramble to the hospital \u2013 legs flurrying like a spider\u2019s \u2013 against the chilling stillness of the background. He arrives at a vision perhaps more spiritual than literal, as fire tears at his mother\u2019s flesh, or at least peels at the ink that makes up her animated skin. What could be a horrifying sight is made comforting, as she\u2019s not consumed by the flames so much as she becomes one with them.A few years after the tragedy, Mahito moves to sprawling estate in the country, still crippled by grief. His father, who, like Miyazaki\u2019s own, runs a factory producing aircraft parts, is newly married to his former sister-in-law, who is expecting. Mahito struggles to settle in, not even warming up to the squadron of excitable grannies scurrying around the property, fawning over corned beef and canned salmon imported from the city, or that heron that creates a nuisance by the window.The film lingers aimlessly here, completely unhurried, as if patience building while letting us sit in Mahito\u2019s grief. Miyazaki tends to make movies about strong, fiery female characters, the types who appear in smaller roles in The Boy and the Heron. Mahito, the rare male protagonist, is purposefully lifeless, his glazed-over reserve keeps things emotionally cold. Only the mischievous granny keeping things amusing alongside that pesky heron, with human teeth and gums garishly protruding from its beak as it beckons towards something beyond.Eventually Mahito is tempted to search for his late mother in a tower protruding from the earth, which is a portal to the alternate worlds we sign up for in Miyazaki films. There we find a shipwreck so overgrown with moss and fern it has become an inhabited island that hosts a whole circle of life. A Moby Dick-sized catfish is gutted and consumed by little pillowy white creatures called warawara. They will transcend and become people in another dimension, if they\u2019re not first mauled by starving pelicans. As usual for Miyazaki, the graceful and grotesque are mere brush strokes apart.Miyazaki has explored grief and the afterlife in the past. He\u2019s a film-maker that has been both haunted and at peace with such thoughts throughout his whole career, which is perhaps why every film is positioned as though it\u2019s his last.The Boy and The Heron is no exception. Though this is an uncommonly mature and joyous meditation on death and legacy, one that paints death as a new beginning, a transition to another time and place, where nothing actual seems final. For a film-maker like Miyazaki, that\u2019s the perfect note to go out on.The Boy and the Heron is screening at the Toronto film festival and will be released in the US on 8 December with a UK date to be announced","149":"This year\u2019s unusual fall festival season, almost entirely devoid of stars and missing some notable big titles, continues with a hushed kick-off for Toronto, a red carpet rolled out but left mostly untrodden. It was as muted inside as it was outside for the premiere of North Star, a rather underwhelming family drama that marks the directorial debut of Kristin Scott Thomas, an actor who one can never see enough of in front of the camera but one who hasn\u2019t quite proved her worth behind it just yet, her film never deserving anything more than a shrug.Not that her low-key story of sisters reuniting for their mother\u2019s wedding was ever intended to grab us by the shoulders \u2013 it\u2019s far too gentle for that \u2013 but it should at least carry with it a great deal more charm or character than it does, something that no amount of idyllic English countryside shots can fix. Using a key element of her own family history as well as the tone of her one-time colleague Richard Curtis, Scott Thomas has introduced herself as a mostly competent film-maker but as a screenwriter with important lessons to learn. Co-written with journalist John Micklethwait, North Star is a film that often finds an interesting or challenging idea, only to leave it unexplored or cast aside in the place of something drabber instead. It\u2019s a soft-pedalled soap with stars who know and can do better.Scarlett Johansson plays a recently promoted navy captain, trying to balance a demanding job with her role as mother and partner to Freida Pinto\u2019s frustrated girlfriend, Sienna Miller plays a Hollywood star, unable to maintain a marriage or long-term relationship and Emily Beecham plays a hard-working nurse who suspects her brash, boorish husband is cheating on her. They\u2019re brought together at their family home to celebrate the third wedding of their mother, played by Scott Thomas, a reunion that causes them all to reflect on the hows and whys of where their lives are at. The key detail carried over from Scott Thomas\u2019s life is that she lost both her father and stepfather to combat and in the film this weighs heavy on Johansson\u2019s character especially, the loss haunting her as she both returns to the home and takes on a position that pays tribute to their legacies.But in her one major stylistic flourish as director, Scott Thomas decides to animate Johansson\u2019s memories, a disastrously twee and ineffective decision that sucks any emotive power from her flashbacks. Perhaps the argument would be made that the cutesy Raymond Briggs-esque sojourns are meant to show how one\u2019s memory can be unreliably rose-tinted and unfairly gendered (one of the film\u2019s more alluring half-ideas) but they\u2019re distractingly out-of-place, not helped by Johansson being the weakest link of the three, struggling with an awkward British accent and confusing stiffness for stoicism. Miller and Beecham are both excellent, the former\u2019s comic delivery elevating some of her ho-hum dialogue, and the latter almost convincing us that she\u2019s playing a real person, even when the script forced her into laughably far-fetched diversions.We\u2019re never quite sure how seriously we\u2019re supposed to take North Star, as either grounded family drama or knockabout sitcom, with bursts of cartoonishly absurd comedy (a silly subplot involving a detective trying to ensnare a cheater crescendoes with a bizarrely bawdy reveal) blunting the impact of the graver, talkier scenes surrounding (a tonal balance that Curtis managed so effortlessly). The film never really nails the long, lived-in history of a sibling dynamic with specific detail kept at a minimum, never cutting quite as close to the bone as it should and when shouty conflict does arrive in the last act, it\u2019s triggered by a baffling, so-what revelation that\u2019s too tame to make sense as the gas that finally causes a house fire. There\u2019s a far more persuasive scene after with Scott Thomas giving herself a monologue filled with more nuance and thoughtfulness than the entirety of the film preceding it but it\u2019s too little too late, a frustrating insight into what this could have become had it been made with a clearer idea of what it\u2019s trying to be.In the murky sea of directorial debuts from established actors, there have been far, far worse attempts than North Star but it\u2019s just too insubstantial to register as anything more than a footnote and definitely not enough to justify any drastic career change.North Star is screening at the Toronto film festival with a release date to be announced","150":"Chasing January\u2019s crowdpleasing comeback Pathaan, here\u2019s further confirmation of Shah Rukh Khan\u2019s status as reigning, benevolent King of Bollywood. Where his earlier film expounded on established formula, Khan\u2019s latest stretches its arms wider and demonstrates flickers of idiosyncratic vision. It is properly pan-Indian: the emergent Tamil action stylist Atlee imports South Indian cinema\u2019s characteristic rowdiness and social conscience, alerting the mass audience to pressing regional concerns \u2013 before apparently losing control over his material. A star vehicle that functions like a runaway train, Jawan covers a lot of ground in surprising fashion at full throttle \u2013 but that\u2019s also a polite way of admitting it\u2019s utterly all over the place.Its surest organising principle is its lead actor, shuffling knowingly and wittily through a range of personas. From his opening line (\u201cwho am I?\u201d), Khan draws us into wondering what relation the bandaged warrior liberating a village in a prologue has to the gruff baldie laying siege to Mumbai\u2019s metro, and the prison warden clinging to a second chance at love. A one-man Cloud Atlas, Jawan is a puzzle movie where the star proves the puzzle; it\u2019s a great showcase for Khan to play everything under the sun: godly badass, dandyish army vet, total sweetheart with a prospective stepdaughter. There\u2019s ego involved, undeniably, but few stars in any cinema could model such radically diverse hats with this much flair.Less smooth are the moving parts around him, a whirlwind of ideas good, bad and flagrantly pilfered that suggests this project would have benefited from one script editor for every five Shah Rukhs. Atlee maintains a frenzied momentum, but he has to, lest we pause to consider the preposterous tosh this plot keeps pushing our way. Once our hero\u2019s genesis is resolved, we\u2019re left with another headscratcher: how a movie that features cinema\u2019s lamest Matrix and Christopher Nolan allusions could also generate a tremendous stretch of highway-bound carnage, as thrilling as anything could Hollywood manage. Jawan will prove no more enduring than Pathaan in the Khan pantheon, but it\u2019s a semi-fascinating display of star power, and a rollicking (if bumpy) Friday-night ride. Jawan is released on 7 September in cinemas.","151":"There\u2019s a certain image associated with gonzo journalism \u2013 daring, confessional, subversive, male. For all its successes and groundbreaking candor, it\u2019s a style conflated with male ego and excess, the extremes of drugs, adventure and eccentricity that men could afford to pursue.Gonzo Girl, the directorial debut of the actor Patricia Arquette, seems, at least on the surface, to be interested in complicating that image, or at least adding some footnotes. The 107-minute film, written by Rebecca Thomas and Jessica Caldwell and based on the semi-autobiographical novel by Cheryl Della Pietra, focuses on a young female assistant to a stand-in for Hunter S Thompson in the summer of 1992. Like her real-life counterpart, Alley Russo (Camila Morrone) is a bookish recent grad with literary aspirations who takes a gig assisting a famous writer at his Colorado ranch. Like Thompson, Willem Dafoe\u2019s Walter Reade is a titanic personality, an erratic live wire subsisting on booze, hallucinogens and elephantine amounts of coke (there\u2019s enough bumps in this movie to rival Wolf of Wall Street).Tellingly, the film begins not with Alley but with Walter, as he conducts a typically volatile and combative reading in New York. Spring-loaded movements, rambling monologues, manic energy \u2013 it\u2019s the type of role Dafoe can sink his teeth into, and he eats every scene. Which is a problem for a film that seems interested in the many female figures who support the reputation of singular genius, but has little interest in their lives outside of their relation to him. We get the barest sense of Alley\u2019s personhood before the ranch, other than a clunky mention of needing money and wanting to write; she arrives shy and hesitant, but quickly adapts to the Walter Reade lifestyle \u2013 drugs, chaos, shooting guns and writing while high in an assemblage of poses and situations coded, either under his gaze or ours, as erotic.Alley\u2019s task, as relayed by Walter\u2019s longtime secretary\/fixer Claudia (Arquette) is to keep the party going but steer Walter to the typewriter just enough to get some good pages to his editor in New York, lest the cashflow cease. Given the hangers-on, the coke, the partying (including with Ray Nicholson\u2019s Larry, a Hollywood actor who pops in and out) and Walter\u2019s insecure, equally erratic girlfriend Devaney (You\u2019s Elizabeth Lail), this is more difficult than promised. Alley begins channeling her ambitions by keeping a journal about Walter, then by writing as Walter, doctoring up his pages when his lifestyle far outpaces his former ability.This amounts to a betrayal, though by the time it\u2019s exposed, the relentless debauchery is too tiresome and the characterization too thin to really care, as if the existence of a lot of drugs, or a toxic kind-of mentor, is enough in itself to justify interest. Arquette\u2019s direction outpaces the writing in this regard; the parties and drug trips are at least compellingly styled and shot, but there\u2019s no sense of why Alley participates so willingly, why she\u2019s charmed by Walter, why she continues to stay.There\u2019s an online joke that Morrone, who managed to eke out some space in the messy ensemble that was Daisy Jones & the Six, has a face that\u2019s seen Instagram, and Gonzo Girl does little to dispel that this is not 1992. Her role is, for the most part, more modeling than acting \u2013 a series of ever more sexy outfits that cater to Walter\u2019s taste (maybe?), in various postures of ecstasy, focus or distress. As the film wears on and the walls close in on Walker (at least financially), she fades away from the story, more trope than character.More interesting is Claudia, a woman whose sweet, somewhat wearied affect masks a sinister, ice-cold self-protective streak \u2013 in other words, a typically Arquette creation. Towards the end, as Alley\u2019s tolerance for Walter\u2019s outbursts wanes, Claudia offers what seems to be the justification for all this mess on-screen: that every woman involved, every invisible secretary or assistant or girlfriend, gets some credit for the work, is responsible for some of the magic. It\u2019s a shrug of a thesis on a skin-deep story. I\u2019m certainly not against a movie of imperfect, messy feminism \u2013 women figuring out their own way in a crazy environment. But like Alley\u2019s imitations of Walter\u2019s prose, there\u2019s a performative profundity to this inert tale of crossed boundaries, toxic bosses and dozens of lines.Gonzo Girl is screening at the Toronto film festival","152":"One autumn day in Paris, a struggling writer named Alain buys a lottery ticket for his married lover, Fanny. The purchase is made on impulse; it\u2019s an offhand romantic gesture and a feeble appeal to the fates. The odds are stacked against these ill-starred lovers and their adulterous affair is surely bound for disaster. But the nights are drawing in and the only moment that counts is now. Being a writer, Alain has a tendency to quote poetry. He says, \u201cWe all get frozen in ice if we don\u2019t act before winter comes.\u201dClosing in on his 88th birthday, Woody Allen likewise appears to be running out of time. His creative juices have flatlined, scandal has made him a pariah, and the Venice organisers drew fierce condemnation for even including him on the programme. And yet, undeterred, he\u2019s still rolling the dice on his musing tales about happenstance and happy accidents, relocating to Europe and working with French actors, like a failing gambler who hopes that a new casino might bring a change in his fortunes. Obviously the lotto ticket\u2019s a bust; that was simply too much to ask. The real shock, though, is the film. It turns out to be the best one he\u2019s managed in a decade at least.Fanny (Lou de La\u00e2ge), we\u2019re told, was once a high-school bohemian. Now she\u2019s wed to the odious Jean (Melvil Poupaud), a self-made millionaire whose chief passion is the train-set which occupies an entire room of their palatial home. She spends her time in posh auction rooms, attending cocktail receptions or hunting deer from the couple\u2019s bucolic weekend retreat. Now, thanks to her dalliance with Alain (Niels Schneider), Fanny reconnects with a different (and woozily romanticised) side of Paris and starts browsing in second-hand bookshops and strolling through leaf-blown city parks. \u201cMy life would be so different if I hadn\u2019t bumped into you on the street,\u201d she declares. Inevitably, though, luck is not on their side. Boiling over with suspicion, Jean has already hired a private detective to trail his wife around town and it is at this point that the melancholic Coup de Chance prepares to jump the points and embark on a different, rather darker track.The strong, credible performances oil the wheels during these clattering shifts of gear and serve to distract from its occasional moments of implausibility. Implicitly, they also invite us to turn a blind eye to some minor continuity errors. Coup de Chance\u2019s action spans six months or so and yet the whole production seems to have been shot in the month of October aside from a brief exterior shot of the country house, where we\u2019re suddenly thrown forward to high summer. By this point in the action, a murder plot has been hatched and the shooting party is in full swing. Everybody involved seems to have slightly lost their bearings.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotionHow Allen continues to conduct his career is obviously his business alone. But if he were ever minded to collect his winnings and quit the table, his 50th feature might be a decent film to go out on. Coup de Chance is variously funny and sad, energetic and easygoing; a stumbling but satisfying autumnal drama that wanders amid the fading light and the golden leaves. For good measure, Allen even throws in an ending which stirs the memory of the classic moose-hunting routine from his old 1960s standup days; a rueful, airy aside that serves to bring the man\u2019s career full-circle.","153":"Child bride, infant sacrifice, bobbysoxer concubine: Priscilla Presley, wife of Elvis, is all these in Sofia Coppola\u2019s eerily gripping, queasily claustrophobic portrait of marital loneliness, trapped behind the kitschy prison gates of Graceland while the King is away on tour, or shooting movies with glamorous worldly female co-stars and a creepily subservient male entourage. Priscilla becomes Memphis\u2019s very own Lady Diana, with Ann-Margret or Nancy Sinatra in the Camilla Parker-Bowles role.The film is based on Elvis and Me, Priscilla\u2019s 1985 memoir of the marriage, and demonstrates Coppola\u2019s characteristically sisterly and non-judgmental intimacy with her heroine. The details, the atmosphere of Priscilla\u2019s bizarre married life, its stretches of boredom and silence; all seem very real. As an insider account, this is a welcome corrective to Baz Luhrmann\u2019s outsider fantasy Elvis and it redoubles what I think of as Coppola\u2019s reputation as the Betty Friedan of 21st-century cinema, presenting us with her distinctive take on feminine mystique.Cailee Spaeny plays Priscilla, the 15-year-old schoolgirl living on a 1950s West German military base with her mom and army dad; she gets invited to a party hosted by Elvis Presley doing his military service. Elvis is rather unassumingly played by Jacob Elordi, who is shrewdly directed by Coppola in such a way that there are no Elvis-impersonation pyrotechnics to upstage Spaeny\u2019s Priscilla. Presley is a perfect gentleman and does not press his attentions improperly on Priscilla. Instead, staggeringly, he persuades her parents to let her live at Graceland, with his own cantankerous father, Vernon, legally in loco parentis, so she can attend Catholic high school there. But when will they get married? And when will Elvis want to have sex with her?There is dark comedy in the extraordinary fan-wish-fulfilment life that Priscilla is living \u2013 at first. She gets to make out with Elvis in the evening and then pout over her schoolbooks in class the next morning; while all her schoolmates are dreaming of kissing Elvis, she is living the dream. But then the awful truth emerges. Elvis refrains from sex with Priscilla (while very clearly not refraining elsewhere), fetishising her intact quasi-childlike innocence while subjecting her to a festival of misogyny, coercion and control in parallel to the way he is kept in line by his overbearing manager, Colonel Tom Parker (who, perhaps oddly, doesn\u2019t appear in the film).Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotionThe pure strangeness of Graceland is pungently conveyed: its weirdly modest smallness, the white grand piano, the creamy-oatmeal carpet. Theirs was a co-dependent life, very much centred on drugs, uppers and downers, to which Elvis introduced Priscilla early on; this was followed by an experiment with LSD, part of Presley\u2019s wary and shortlived interest in the counterculture. And Graceland was the incongruously provincial location for it all.Eventually, Priscilla gets a baby, Lisa Marie, and an adult makeover closely policed by Elvis (who turns out to have strident views on women\u2019s fashion); Priscilla\u2019s hair and makeup job, intentionally or not, makes her look like one of the GoodFellas wives. But the movie argues that, as Priscilla grew up, Elvis became more and more infantilised, paranoid and charmless, especially in his endless Vegas residencies.Coppola\u2019s portrait is absorbing, especially in Priscilla\u2019s child phase, and if it is less distinctive in its final section, as Priscilla becomes more briskly disillusioned and realistic about what to expect, then that is to be expected. Her credulous servitude and innocence is more dramatic and more poignant. This film says a great deal about Elvis and the dysfunctional business he was in and Priscilla\u2019s modest integrity and courage. Priscilla screened at the Venice film festival; it is released on 27 October in the US; it is released in UK and Irish cinemas on 26 December.","154":"Ryu Hamaguchi\u2019s quietist, enigmatic eco-parable Evil Does Not Exist refuses easy explanations and perhaps it refuses difficult explanations as well. It\u2019s a complex drama, a realist film teetering on the edge of the uncanny, whose very title points the way towards the idea that there are shades of grey in every judgment we make. It is arguably opaque and contrived, and will possibly exasperate as many as it intrigues, but I found it rippling around in my mind long after the final, extended shot with its two figures receding into the mist.At first glance, this seems a cut-and-dried case of a story about corporate capitalism despoiling the environment: Takumi (played by acting newcomer Hitoshi Omika, a former AD in Hamaguchi\u2019s previous films) lives with his young daughter Hana in a beautifully unspoiled village \u2013 almost like a figure in a folk tale. This idyllic spot, with a deer trail, is a short drive outside Tokyo: Takumi apparently makes a living chopping wood and gathering clear water from a stream in billy cans for a local noodle restaurant for whom this is an essential ingredient, far superior to mere tap water. Inevitably, this paradise can\u2019t last: Takumi is already slightly uneasy at the gunshot-sounds of people hunting nearby, and for all that he is a devoted father, he has a bad habit of forgetting to pick Hana up from school.Things come to a crisis when Takumi and his neighbours learn that a Tokyo company has bought up swathes of land nearby, intending to turn it into a \u201cglamping\u201d site for well-off city tourists. The town meeting that this company perfunctorily sets up, supposedly to listen to residents\u2019 concerns, reveals that the proposed site\u2019s septic tank will poison the water supply, that the company is pushing through this scheme to qualify for post-pandemic government grants, and that it is quite indifferent to locals\u2019 worries in any case. The two blandly smiling functionaries who pretend to listen to the village\u2019s complaints at the meeting are employees of a TV talent agency which has diversified into corporate PR.But Hamaguchi\u2019s narrative direction of travel becomes unclear. These two PRs reveal themselves to be unhappy and guilty at what they are doing, especially at their employers\u2019 crass and clumsy plan to offer Takumi a \u201ccaretaker\u201d job on the glamping site. A long dialogue scene during their car journey reveals that they are vulnerable human beings as much deserving of the audience\u2019s respect as the villagers: and one even appears to have an epiphany or nervous breakdown right then and there in the woodland.And even Takumi\u2019s own attitude to the glampers isn\u2019t clear. At the meeting itself, so far from angrily and straightforwardly denouncing the scheme, he points out that he and all the other residents are themselves incomers, after a fashion, part of a governmental plan that allowed farming in that region after the war, which itself damaged the environment, to a degree.Hamaguchi takes all this at an absolutely unhurried pace, like that of a twig floating downstream. There are long stretches in which his camera will gaze up at the sky while drifting through the forest, and the musical score will sometimes hard-cut to silence at the end of a sequence like this. Weirdly, Hamaguchi\u2019s camera appears to be attached to Takumi\u2019s rear bumper in one scene in which he picks Hana up from school, the shot infinitesimally shudders and then moves along with the car at it leaves.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotionWhy? What is the point of these compositional quirks? What is the point of the story itself? Most cinema signposts everything and \u2013 to quote the phrase apocryphically attributed to Billy Wilder \u2013 makes everything obvious, especially the subtleties. This isn\u2019t what Hamaguchi is doing: his movie is closer to a prose poem, in which the larger building blocks of narrative might not fit together in the expected way but be as mysterious and extraneous as glancingly small details. I\u2019m not sure that Evil Does Not Exist is the very best of his work, but it is presented with such calm assurance and artistry that it compels a kind of wistful, if uncomprehending, assent.","155":"There is a streak of boundary-pushing and wantonness to this Norwegian comedy-horror that bodes well for the career of director Viljar B\u00f8e, even if this, his third feature, is not executed with quite enough finesse to match the rabid premise. It hangs on the quintessential modern dating conundrum: what would you do if you bagged your dream partner, only to find out that they live with someone who dresses and acts like their dog?That\u2019s the dilemma for scatty student Sigrid (Katrine Lovise \u00d8pstad Fredriksen), who, despite turning up to their first date in her gym clothes, seems to have struck on an implausible match of opposites in well-tailored, impeccably mannered, calorie-counting multimillionaire orphan Christian (Gard L\u00f8kke). She lounges in his bachelor mansion, gets crispy bacon on demand at breakfast \u2013 but almost runs away howling when his \u201cpet\u201d, Frank (Nicolai Narvesen Lied), crawls in on all fours during dinner. The impression she has hooked up with a barking-mad Bruce Wayne is compounded by the eerie normality with which Christian treats this arrangement.In the interests of love, Sigrid decides to take the higher path, educating herself about \u201cpuppy play\u201d on the internet. But there appears to be nothing sexual going on between Christian and Frank, who is his childhood friend and fellow loner. As Sigrid habituates herself to a menage \u00e0 trois, B\u00f8e milks this scenario for layers of delightful discomfort. His film isn\u2019t a Nordic S&M comedy of manners like 2019\u2019s Dogs Don\u2019t Wear Pants, nor a liberal probing of delusion like 2007\u2019s Lars and the Real Girl. It also thrives on a spikier paranoia: that all this theatre is really a form of gaslighting, just with doggie treats, and Sigrid is being manipulated or groomed in some way.Both leads are good, but the ultra-controlled L\u00f8kke \u2013 with his poster-boy looks and too-timely smiles \u2013 is pivotal to stringing out the farce. Good Boy darkens in its second half, it goes in a rather conventional horror direction and, sadly, it opts not to get truly weird and tail-chase its more original impulses (like, as Sigrid asks, whether Frank gets to have sex). Still, there is enough meat here \u2013 touching on digital dating etiquette and the underlying emotional viscera \u2013 for a Hollywood remake. Time for Matt Damon to wriggle into that furry outfit. Good Boy is available on digital platforms on 11 September.","156":"The sun-splashed Venice film festival provided an unlikely backdrop for the premiere of Wes Anderson\u2019s The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar, an enjoyable bedtime story of sorts, converted from the 1976 tale by Roald Dahl. The guests sheltered from the heat inside the main cinema while the director moseyed on stage with a diffident shrug. What followed was a cosy, wholesome, purely soothing affair. The only thing missing was a cup of warm cocoa.\u201cI hope that you like it. And if you don\u2019t that\u2019s OK, because it\u2019s very short,\u201d Anderson explained by way of introduction, setting the scene for a droll 40-minute featurette that will duly be heading over to Netflix within the space of a month. The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar marks the director\u2019s second adaptation of Dahl, after his animated take on Fantastic Mr Fox, and recounts the fortunes of a wealthy gambler (played by Benedict Cumberbatch) who masters the ability to read the reverse sides of playing cards. Armed with this superpower, Sugar sets out to fleece his favourite London casino \u2026 only to awake the next morning feeling more morally bankrupt than ever.Close your eyes and imagine a Wes Anderson movie. The odds are that it looks very much like this one: beautifully composed and tailored to within an inch of its life. For better or worse, the director has a house style. For better or worse, he now seems chained to it. In Anderson\u2019s best work (Rushmore, say, or The Royal Tenenbaums), the painstaking design gives the impression of somehow being authored by his protagonists. It\u2019s almost as if the carefully arranged frames are the characters\u2019 immaculate conceptions: an attempt at self-actualisation, or a fireguard against their vulnerabilities. In his lesser work, though, the technique is too much. It sucks oxygen from the films and reduces the people to waxworks. One longs to break open a window and allow in some fresh air.The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar, to its credit, makes a bonus of its artifice. Leaning into his role as Dahl\u2019s translator, seemingly showing his workings every chance that he has, Anderson proceeds to spin a story within a story, deftly augmenting the conceit with sliding stage-sets and frequent nods to the audience.The tale starts out being narrated by Dahl (ably impersonated by Ralph Fiennes) in his writing shed. From there the baton is passed to Dr ZZ Chatterjee (Dev Patel) in Calcutta, then to Imdad Khan (Ben Kingsley), the self-styled \u201cMan Who Could Read Without His Eyes\u201d \u2013 and finally back to feckless Henry Sugar in his London townhouse. These people tell the story while simultaneously performing their roles, turning from the action to address the camera with such gusto that they surely risk whiplash \u2013 but the effect is amusing and invites us in on the joke. At one point Anderson even relaxes enough to poke fun at his own control-freak reputation. He has a stagehand materialise mid-scene in order to move Kingsley from one side of the shot to the other.\u201cThis will change my life!\u201d exclaims vain, pointless Sugar upon gaining his all-seeing magic power \u2013 and so it does, except not quite in the way that he initially thought it might. The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar was widely regarded as one of Dahl\u2019s gentler, happier short stories \u2013 insofar as it didn\u2019t feature a serial killer landlady or an infant Adolf Hitler. It spun a reassuring yarn of redemption and saluted a bad man who made good. Anderson\u2019s short, sweet, neatly managed production follows the original tale pretty much to the letter. The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar screened at the Venice film festival and is released on 27 September on Netflix.","157":"That cooing note of kindness and pity in the title is misleading \u2013 in fact, there is pure vivisectional ruthlessness in this toweringly bizarre epic. Poor Things is a steampunk-retrofuturist Victorian freakout and macabre black-comic horror, adapted by screenwriter Tony McNamara from the 1992 novel by Alasdair Gray and directed by the absurdist virtuoso Yorgos Lanthimos. Lanthimos shows us an extraordinary, artificial, contorted world, partly shot in monochrome, sometimes bulging out at us through a fish-eye lens, elsewhere lit from within in richly saturated tones, like an engraved colour plate.And his leading lady is someone who takes it to the next career level, or the level beyond the next level: Emma Stone. She gives an amazing and hilarious performance as the sexual-innocent primitive Bella Baxter, the secret experimental subject and ward of charismatic, troubled anatomist Dr Godwin Baxter (whom she calls \u201cGod\u201d), played by Willem Dafoe. Bella\u2019s beady gaze under a near-monobrow takes everything in, while she makes what sense she can from the brave new world with which Dr Baxter has surrounded her.Bella is a young woman who had attempted to take her own life by throwing herself from London\u2019s Tower Bridge. Baxter daringly has her body retrieved under cover of darkness from the Thames\u2019s muddy bank and \u2013 like a cross between Mary Shelley\u2019s Victor Frankenstein and Shaw\u2019s Henry Higgins \u2013 reanimates her using methods whose exotic ghastliness is only revealed at the story\u2019s end.Childlike and yet adult-bodied and increasingly excited by her discovery of masturbation \u2013 which in turn stimulates her language skills beyond infantile pidgin English \u2013 Bella is a shocking and beguiling figure. She is tutored and looked after by Dr Baxter, his housekeeper Mrs Prim (a great turn from Vicky Pepperdine) and Baxter\u2019s fresh-faced research assistant Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), who falls deeply in love with Bella. Baxter permits Max to propose to his young pupil on condition that the married couple continue to live with him in his colossally intricate townhouse.But disaster beckons when the solicitor who arrives with the documents formalising this arrangement turns out to be a bounder and a cad; he seduces Bella and takes her away with him on a grand European tour of sensual indulgence and adventure, and Dr Baxter fatalistically concludes he has no choice but to let Bella go. This wicked fellow is one Duncan Wedderburn \u2013 an outrageously funny performance from Mark Ruffalo, whose entire face is transformed into fleshy naughtiness by adding a moustache and, in one scene, a straw boater.Lanthimos draws on Lynch\u2019s The Elephant Man and Franju\u2019s Eyes Without a Face, and Emma Stone\u2019s gloriously artless heroine has something of Herzog\u2019s Kaspar Hauser or Emily Watson\u2019s Bess in Lars von Trier\u2019s Breaking the Waves. Her faintly jerky head movements and unselfconscious gait \u2013 awkward and yet somehow elegant at the same time \u2013 is also rather like Ray Bolger\u2019s Scarecrow from The Wizard of Oz.With the disreputable Wedderburn, Bella visits Lisbon, where she is mesmerised by a beautiful fado song, and Alexandria, where she takes it upon herself to rescue people from poverty using Duncan\u2019s winnings from the casino. In Paris they are to find their nadir and Bella realises that sex work is the key to paying the bills. Bella becomes, in her way, a great Victorian explorer and adventurer and discoverer of the sexual self, like a figure from Steven Marcus\u2019s The Other Victorians or Ronald Pearsall\u2019s The Worm in the Bud. And how amazing that she is entirely convincing by the end as a romantic figure and autodidact who, unlike Frankenstein\u2019s monster, aspires to study medicine herself.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotionThis film comes to us from an elite group of talent, including cinematographer Robbie Ryan and production designers James Price and Shona Heath, with an insinuatingly strange musical score by Jerskin Fendrix.

Ibrahim Nash\u2019at\u2019s documentary is named for its principal location, a former CIA stronghold on the outskirts of Kabul, hastily abandoned and haphazardly vandalised by its previous tenants. The base contains treasures but it has been left in a state. Afghan fighters pick their way through the corridors, weighing up their surroundings, wondering just where to begin. They could be a band of hotel cleaners called in to mop up after a heavy-duty stag weekend.Leading the band is Mawlawi Mansour, a bushy-bearded Taliban commander whose father was killed in a US airstrike. Nash\u2019at shows him doggedly going about his duties. He stretches his legs on the newfangled treadmill in the gym. He checks the expiration date of cough drops and calamine lotion in the medical stockroom. \u201cOur head doctor is lazy,\u201d one of his lieutenants explains, at which point Mansour flashes a pained look at the camera.The commander likes to boast that his own wife was a doctor before giving up work as a condition of marriage. If Mrs Mansour was still free to practise, she might have been able to lick this small hospital into shape.Nash\u2019at \u2013 who was born in Egypt and is based in Berlin \u2013 spent 12 months trailing Mansour and his crew, loitering in the background and shooting from the sidelines. If his finished film is light on probing interviews and rigorous analysis, there\u2019s an obvious reason: his subjects all hate him.The Taliban fighters view every journalist as a foreign spy and have accepted the presence of this one only under duress. \u201cThat little devil is filming again,\u201d one mutters when Nash\u2019at draws too close. If the director misbehaves, says another, he will promptly be taken outside and killed.When US forces quit Afghanistan in the spring of 2021 they left behind an estimated $7bn (\u00a35.5bn) worth of military equipment. Mansour\u2019s main task \u2013 in addition to checking expiration dates \u2013 is to oversee the repair and repainting of the fighter jets and Black Hawk helicopters, officially in advance of a victory parade but also conceivably in preparation for a war against neighbouring Tajikistan.This prospect appears to provide the soldiers with a sense of purpose, something to fill their days and plug the gaps in their hearts. The Taliban are triumphant, but this win feels like a loss. \u201cMy burning wish is to see American troops still here,\u201d one soldier admits. \u201cThat way I could ambush them, kill them, die and become a martyr.\u201dWhile it would have been good to have Nash\u2019at properly cross-examine these men, his film\u2019s careful approach pays handsome dividends. Hollywoodate teases back a corner of the curtain to reveal a Taliban regime stitched awkwardly over the bones of US occupation. It shows us the soldiers pining for the caves where they once hid, and mourning the glorious death that has somehow been snatched from their grasp.The film hits its head-spinning crescendo during the surreal celebrations at Bagram airbase, which feature a motorbike parade by \u201cthe suicide bombing battalion\u201d, a unit that wouldn\u2019t have been out of place in Chris Morris\u2019s Four Lions. The battalion\u2019s members pass through in some haste, trailing their broken dreams and dashed ambitions. For these men in particular, there has been no happy ending. They ride off into an uncertain future; unfulfilled, still alive.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotion Hollywoodgate screened at the Venice film festival","159":"Most children indulge in the occasional revenge fantasy. Imagine if a famous movie star decided to be your best friend \u2013 right after your actual best friend stopped talking to you. Or how about if MI5 got in touch with you because they needed a kid to help out with a top secret mission? Or what if you trained an enormous pack of assorted sizes of dogs to be your best friends, and they did your bidding and took down all your enemies and stole diamonds for you? This latter scenario is essentially the premise of the new film from Luc Besson, and it\u2019s as wacky as it sounds.Caleb Landry Jones plays Doug, our luckless protagonist, whose life is such an unimaginably relentless shitshow that he retreats entirely from humanity and holes up in an abandoned school with a pack of dozens of canine chums. The doggos\u2019 rapport with Doug is so strong that it borders on psychic. They understand English perfectly. They are as happy tiptoeing into a wealthy older woman\u2019s bedroom to silently lift an expensive necklace from her nightstand as they are gripping a local crime lord\u2019s nutsack in their vice-like jaws.But Doug isn\u2019t just the ringleader of a group of miracle pups. A wheelchair user since midway through his wildly violent and dysfunctional childhood, he pivots to performing as a drag artist after an unsuccessful job-hunting montage set to Eurythmics\u2019 Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This). Thereafter he divides his time between crooning \u00c9dith Piaf and Marlene Dietrich numbers and supervising his gang of canine criminals as they commit various jewel heists. He\u2019s a multitasker.Now, if you close your mind to the possibilities of film and write off imaginative gambits as \u201cludicrous\u201d without ever having really given a bold vision a chance, it\u2019s not great; cinema should be an art where the ostensibly ludicrous can take flight and flourish. All that said, and all due respect to the originality and commitment displayed here, but this is as ludicrous a film as you\u2019ll see all year, maybe ever. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a way to make this theoretically fun premise work better, but regrettably Besson hasn\u2019t found it.Besson reached the height of his popularity in the 1990s with films such as L\u00e9on and The Fifth Element, but has since faced rape allegations by an actor who worked with him on Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets, before being cleared of all charges. Dogman is the intended comeback, and it\u2019ll certainly make you sit up and take notice. Unfortunately, once it has your attention, you simply can\u2019t look away \u2013 and not in a good way.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotion Dogman screened at the Venice film festival.","160":"A Scandi entry in the cabin-in-the-woods horror subgenre, Joonas Pajunen and Max Seeck\u2019s feature debut starts out in rather familiar territory. Years after a gruesome tragedy where their father is bludgeoned with an axe and their mother disappears, three siblings return to the site of the crime: their childhood home nestled in the depths of a mysterious forest.For much of its slow-burn running time, The Knocking ploughs the furrow of the reductive trauma plot that has weighed down many contemporary horror films. The tense reunion stirs up past secrets and resentments, and the characters are defined less by memorable traits than merely by revelations of the abuse they endured as children. The visuals are pretty much forgettable also, with overuse of that one stylistic device familiar from a litany of scary movies: an aerial drone shot of a car speeding down a lonely road, flanked by foreboding trees.Though shackled to a lacklustre beginning and middle, the third act proves to be an impressive surprise. In the same way that their dark family history has slowly poisoned the souls of the siblings, a malevolent force is also leaking out of every branch of the eerie forest. This culminates in a nearly wordless and surreal chase sequence bathed in crimson light. Without giving too much away, the earlier mentions of past trauma finally coalesce into a more concrete form of monstrous dread, transforming what could have been a run-of-the-mill flick into a thrilling eco-horror parable. The orchestral, classical-inflected score is another nice touch that further elevates the fatalistic final scenes. The Knocking is ultimately a drive worth taking.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotion The Knocking is released on 4 September on digital platforms.","161":"\u2018Oh and Rhona \u2026 remember, the secret is to never look back,\u201d says sinister hitchhiker Carla (Nicolette McKeown), as she climbs a cliff. \u201cYou mean down,\u201d someone corrects her. Yes, we get the point, given that half the characters in the film are nursing past traumas, from random acts of rural brutality to Middle Eastern combat theatre flashbacks. But such is the unsubtle way of Ryan Hendrick\u2019s overblown Highland horror; it can\u2019t settle for simply being a stripped-down descent into wilderness atavism. It also chucks in an irrepressibly horny crew of hikers, creepy Scottish folktales and gratuitous Homeric quotations for good measure.The real killer is the highly implausible instigating incident. Rhona (Lauren Lyle) and pals set off on to the moors to locate the family cabin she has been bequeathed, despite grim memories of the area. But then tensions, especially simmering sexual jealousy, rise when they lose their bearings and combat veteran Carla takes matters into her own hands. It\u2019s not really clear why she takes such drastic action, other than the need \u2013 with her insistence that they are now bound together by this terrible event \u2013 to get these sorry daytrippers marching even further towards backwoods peril.Mercy Falls makes basic errors of dramatic orientation: mistaking characters\u2019 bedhopping designs for personality traits, letting them act irrationally in service of the plot (solo toilet trips, or example, would seem like a no-no). But Hendrick does undeniably have a feel for the terrain, filming the glens, crags and heaths lovingly in interludes between the bloodletting, occasionally using the illusion of a diorama, making lifesize things look miniature, to queasy effect.It inevitably boils down to what you might call a Scottish version of Predator, only with a woman in Gore-Tex instead of Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Carla\u2019s unhinged, keffiyeh-wearing fugitive instead of old crabface. But at least Carla has the good grace to knock off the ensemble in ascending order of acting ability, leaving this contrived trek resting in the steady hands of Lyle, who always underplays with an intriguing resoluteness. Mercy Falls is released on 1 September in UK cinemas and on 6 November on digital platforms.","162":"An up-close-and-personal portrait of the long-running Brigade Sarbati Orchestra, a titan in the Congolese music scene, this vibrates with the energy that emanates from studio rehearsals and live performances. Juxtaposed with fly-on-the-wall observations of lengthy recording sessions is vibrant footage of the bustling Kinshasa streets, a dynamic flow of imagery that underlines how rumba forms an integral part of the country\u2019s cultural heritage.Congolese rumba might seem purely improvisational on the surface, but in practice it requires immense discipline and professional rapport. When following extended studio sessions, the camera swirls between singers and instrumentalists, the frenetic movements capturing the thrilling magic that sparks when the musicians play off each other. On stage, the cathartic pleasure of these pieces is intensified by the amazing dancers, whose swaying hips and dexterous footwork sends the crowd into ecstatic frenzy.But amid the beautiful music produced by the Brigade Sarbati Orchestra, there are also notes of discord. A young musician called Lumumba speaks candidly about what he considers favouritism inside the Brigade Sarbati, with similar tensions emerging inside the recording studio. In one scene, the musicians argue fiercely over whose names should be included in a song\u2019s lyrics.Rumba Rules grapples with these internal disputes, but neglects to dive deeper into another glaring imbalance: the obvious gender disparity in the orchestra, where there are female dancers yet the musicians on screen are predominantly male. Ending on the melancholic image of Lumumba gently caressing a statue of legendary Congolese musician Franco Luambo, the film evokes the passion as well as the turmoil of a new generation of rumba artists. The last paragraph of this article was amended on 31 August 2023 to clarify that while there are female dancers in the film, the musicians are predominantly male. Rumba Rules is available from 1 September on True Story.","163":"With its deep-fried cinematography, engine oil-colour palette and a score that seems to be composed almost entirely of reverb-heavy blues guitar and cicadas, Mob Land is going all in on the deep southern gothic atmosphere. It\u2019s just a pity that the acting is so conspicuously effortful, the plot is formulaic and the pacing drags like a wounded pig at a hog shoot.Shiloh Fernandez stars as Shelby, a financially struggling dirt track racer; John Travolta is Shelby\u2019s uncle, the jaded sheriff who brings his own brand of justice to the table. Stephen Dorff chews his way through the role of an out-of-town mob enforcer who crosses paths with both.","164":"Here\u2019s a rousing empowerment-anthem of a movie that\u2019s not afraid to paint its romance plotline in big, bold brushstrokes; occasionally it overdoes things but the rush of emotion carries everything along in its path, helped by the deployment of radio-friendly standards by Neil Diamond and the like that turns the film into an impromptu musical and allows writer-director Janis Pugh to stage (relatively) elaborate dance sequences and big emotional scenes.The central figure is put-upon chicken-processing factory worker Helen (played by Louise Brealey) who has a complicated domestic situation: she lives in the same crummy terrace as her oafish husband Gary, from whom she is separated but seemingly not actually divorced, and shares the place with his new, much younger, girlfriend Amy (Emily Fairn) and their newly arrived baby. Also on the premises is Gary\u2019s terminally ill mother Gwen (Sorcha Cusack), for whom Helen acts a carer but is the quasi-maternal figure that Helen appears to long for. There\u2019s also a rowdy Greek chorus of Helen\u2019s fellow factory workers who are perhaps designed as a counterpoint to Helen\u2019s introverted, clenched unhappiness, at least at first.The dam breaks with the arrival next door of glamorous returnee Joanne (Annabel Scholey) who, it turns out, had fascinated Helen right back from their schooldays together, 20 years earlier \u2013 though, we are given to understand, they barely spoke. But it doesn\u2019t take long before Joanne is turning up at the factory with her sports car and ghetto blaster and whisking Helen off for a bit of romancing, in which a detached store-mannequin doll\u2019s head and a pair of stilts play a significant part. Joanne isn\u2019t quite the problem-free zone she initially appears: she has her own backstory of upset and humiliation to cope with, too.Pugh\u2019s film mixes standard-issue Brit-misery realism with elements of whimsy: the opening scene, for example, features a floating dandelion seed-head that is amusingly reminiscent of the drifting tumbleweed in the Coen brother\u2019s Big Lebowski, and one of the musical numbers descends into a massive chicken-carcass fight inside the factory. (You have to hope the poultry weren\u2019t real.) In contrast, Pugh stages a genuinely alarming scene in which Gary \u2013 hitherto a bit of a pantomime villain \u2013 loses it at a funeral with briefly terrifying results. Both leads are very good, with Brealey in particular handling the switch of registers \u2013 from heart-to-hearts with Gwen, bitter disagreements with Gary, and supercharged, over-the-top singalongs \u2013 with aplomb. In the end, Pugh\u2019s film undoubtedly wants to warm hearts, and this it manages to full effect.Chuck Chuck Baby screened at the Edinburgh film festivalAll of our Edinburgh festival reviews","165":"Film scene: a wood-panelled library of some elegance on the Canadian-American border. So precisely on the border, in fact, that a line of black duct tape running across the polished marble floor divides the building between Quebec and Vermont.It was here, explains our soft-spoken narrator, that three men brought a backpack through the US entrance in 2011, depositing it in a lavatory to be collected by a criminal who then left through the Canadian exit. The bag was full of smuggled guns.In 45th Parallel, a film by the Turner prize-winning artist Lawrence Abu Hamdan screening at Edinburgh\u2019s Talbot Rice Gallery, the camera now homes in on the narrator, Mahdi Fleifel. A Danish-Palestinian director, Fleifel knows something about borders himself, having been raised in a refugee camp in Lebanon. In the film, he is sitting in the adjoining opera house of the Haskell Free Library. On stage (technically Quebec; the opera house\u2019s seating is in Vermont) is footage of the fatal spot on the Mexican-American border that featured in the notorious supreme court case of Hern\u00e1ndez v Mesa.Jesus Mesa was a US border patrol agent who came across some Mexican children playing on the border one June evening in 2010. He killed unarmed Mexican teenager Sergio Hern\u00e1ndez with a single gunshot to the head. All that separated them was 18 metres (60ft) and the invisible border \u2013 literally an unmarked line in the sand.Mexico indicted Mesa for murder, but the US refused to extradite him. The US supreme court voted 5-4 that the American constitution terminates at the border and does not extend \u2013 as Mesa\u2019s bullet did \u2013into Mexico. The implications of this verdict (to paraphrase the film\u2019s superb script) are very far-reaching \u2013 like the fatal bullet itself.Drone strikes launched in the US end the lives of Syrian civilians, infants in Afghanistan, a wedding procession in Yemen. Devastating reconnaissance footage is woven into the film\u2019s immensely subtle narrative. Borders prove intangible and absurd, porous in life, and susceptible to the loopholes embodied in the Haskell Library itself, yet also a matter of life and death, according to the law.Abu Hamdan\u2019s work is always a brilliant fusion of moving image, researched fact and theatrical performance (in this case by the captivating Fleifel). Completed last year, 45th Parallel is his best film yet and not to be missed at this somewhat uneven edition of the annual Edinburgh art festival. All its moral and philosophical dilemmas, its visions, tales and sounds (including an eerie music specially scored for the opera house scenes) are as condensed as a sonnet. The whole vast experience is contained in 15 minutes.Also at the Talbot Rice Gallery, Irish artist Jesse Jones has turned the next-door gallery, ordinarily full of light, into a pitch-black multimedia installation, The Tower. Out of the darkness looms a sequence of spotlit vignettes: a circular stone portal in the wall, pierced with holes through which you peer into an anchorite\u2019s cell; a girl crouched at the bottom of a towering ladder; a stone statue of a long-haired woman dressed in nothing but animal skins, rising out of a heap of shattered rocks.On a giant screen, young women sing in ecstatic medieval polyphony. There is a prevailing sense of female community, of the bonds between women, the heights they have to scale, the darkness into which they are pushed, punished, shut away. Bewildering when you first enter, the elements gradually begin to merge into a kind of ancient-modern promenade performance that clearly touches on Hildegard of Bingen and Julian of Norwich. But only the accompanying text, with its references to Ireland\u2019s patriarchal history, and its abortion laws, brings the work into the present or indeed into any kind of meaningful coherence.More concise, and far less elaborate, is a work by Crystal Bennes in Platform: Early Career Artist award at Trinity Apse, a former gothic kirk off the Royal Mile. Bennes\u2019s subject is the 17th-century economist and politician William Petty and his early version of racial eugenics, a proposal to \u201cimprove\u201d Ireland by sending 7,000 English women into forced marriage with Irish men. Their children would all be raised as English Protestants, the girls with a work ethic invoked here in sculptures related to the hard labour of laundry, land and dairy farms. Best of all is a lifesize cameo of the vile Petty, bewigged, impressed into the surface of a basin of what appears to be curdled and solidifying milk.A few steps further down the steep stone alleys off the Mile is the strangest contrast imaginable, between two well-established artists in prominent public galleries.Peter Howson has been awarded a three-floor retrospective at the City Art Centre at the age of 65. Nobody even slightly familiar with the strenuous and tormented expressionism of this Ayrshire-raised, Glasgow-trained painter will be surprised to hear that very little has changed down the years. Where Howson once painted the hell of Glasgow life among drunks, vagrants, the poor and unemployed, so he came to record the hell of the Bosnian war with the same brutal machismo, conflating hints of Michelangelo with a raw and sometimes caricatural muscularity.And so he now paints scenes from the Bible, having a new sense of God\u2019s presence in the world. There are small portrait heads of gnarled saints and apostles and vast martyrdoms and crucifixions. Wall texts declare these works to be \u201ccountercultural to the expectations of a 21st-century artist\u201d but they are entirely expected in other ways. Everything, from the delicate to the numinous, compassionate or redemptive, is sacrificed to the force of Howson\u2019s dark brushwork. We are all still in hell.Directly across the road at the Fruitmarket gallery, Portuguese artist Leonor Antunes has a hanging garden \u2013 or perhaps it is more like a sequence of rooms \u2013 of knotted and woven works suspended from the ceiling. Each is diaphanous and elegant, crafted in all kinds of materials from silk, twine and hemp to copper wire and pineapple leather. Some feel like screened enclosures, others are more vine-like, reminiscent of bridles or rope ladders.The works apparently refer to other artists, including Lena Bergner and Trude Guermonprez, Bauhaus designers forced to flee Germany in the 1940s, and Sadie Speight who worked on the Royal Festival Hall. Their names occasionally appear in Antunes\u2019s titles, as if she were talking to them somewhere offstage. And though there is an almost ethereal serenity to this refined and meticulous art, it is also discreet to the point of reticence, if not withdrawal.The Stills gallery has a magnificent show of monochrome photographs by the veteran Prague-born photographer Mark\u00e9ta Luska\u010dov\u00e1, focused upon her images of children\u2019s lives. Gawping, gazing, curious, rapt, comforting each other in fights, innocently aping the adults, trying to learn how to be grown up, in hardship or poverty, when still young enough to invent hilarious games involving nothing but their own school jumpers.At first, it seems they are all from Soviet bloc countries \u2013 four to a bed, out on their mother\u2019s back during the potato harvest, watching itinerant jugglers in some far-distant market. But then you notice the familiar stripes of a primary school dress in some English playground in summer and the dreich flat sands of Whitley Bay in Tyne and Wear. The street musician performing with a couple of small puppets, poignant counterparts of the human infants in the buggy beside her, was photographed in London in 1990.Luska\u010dov\u00e1\u2019s compositions are as superb as her power of noticing. Girls skip across a playground, linked cardigan to cardigan in a chain of black diamonds. A boy holds his upright dog by the paw, a little friend exactly half his height. A child stands vertical before his grandmother, flat upon the floor, in a configuration like a sign of the cross. It takes a moment before you realise she is dead.Luska\u010dov\u00e1 wheeled her own small son around the London to which she fled, from communist Prague, in 1975. It is almost as if she takes in the world from his height. A photograph shot in Brick Lane in 1977 shows an encounter between a lion cub and a greyhound, barely restrained on its leash. Behind them stand a pair of small children, equally alive to the staggering moment.Lawrence Abu Hamdan: 45th Parallel is at the Talbot Rice Gallery, Edinburgh, until 30 SeptemberThe Tower is at the Talbot Rice Gallery, Edinburgh, until 30 SeptemberPlatform: Early Career Artist award is at Trinity Apse, Edinburgh, until 27 AugustWhen the Apple Ripens: Peter Howson at 65 is at the City Art Centre, Edinburgh, until 1 OctoberLeonor Antunes: The Apparent Length of a Floor Area is at the Fruitmarket, Edinburgh, until 8 OctoberMark\u00e9ta Luska\u010dov\u00e1 is at Stills, Edinburgh, until 7 October.

Prosthetics engineer Abi (Georgina Campbell) takes a new job with fringe benefits \u2013 specifically a passive-aggressive robot butler named TIM (Eamon Farren, suitably creepy). TIM is attentive and solicitous, but the numerous cutaways to knives and waste disposal units leave us with little doubt about the threats that lurk in Abi\u2019s perfect life.","167":"A celebrated middle-aged author returns, for the first time in 35 years, to his home town in the Cognac-producing region in south-western France. St\u00e9phane (Guillaume de Tonqu\u00e9dec) has been asked to give a keynote speech, but his motives for accepting the invitation have more to do with reconnecting with his own romantic past. He bonds with Lucas (Victor Belmondo), a young man who, it turns out, is the son of St\u00e9phane\u2019s long-lost first love.Adapted from an autobiographical novel by Philippe Besson and weaving together two timelines, this is a handsome but ploddingly predictable drama. The striking wide-screen cinematography gives an impression of generous scope and openness. But in fact, like St\u00e9phane himself, the storytelling is oddly insular and fussy. The highlight here is a supporting character: the longsuffering event organiser Ga\u00eblle, played by Guilaine Londez with a huge, over-stretched smile and the kind of clenched-jawed positivity that seems to teeter on the brink of psychosis.","168":"Du\u0161an Makavejev was the Serbian creator of the incendiary 1971 movie WR: Mysteries of the Organism, the final word in that title destined forever to be misread as \u201corgasm\u201d. He was a satirist, political subversive and eroto-evangelist, a performance artist of ex-Yugoslavia\u2019s cinematic Black Wave. Love Affair, or The Case of the Missing Switchboard Operator is an early work from 1967, a brilliant pulp classic which showed that the 1960s could swing behind the iron curtain. I wonder: did anything in the French new wave measure up to this level of nihilist black humour? Godard gave us Breathless; Makavejev gave us an actual breathless corpse.It\u2019s about a bored young woman working for a telephone exchange: she wears an audio headset, pushing plugs into sockets and putting people through. She falls in love with an intense young man employed in plumbing and waterworks, but cheats on him with the sleazy postman to the murderous rage of her new boyfriend \u2013 and vanishes. The result is something insouciantly explicit and disturbing that defies classification. The action is bisected with digressive lectures on sexology and criminology, with slogans flashed up on screen, clips from Soviet propaganda movies, fourth walls broken. You might call it a forensic crime comedy because the love affair is interspersed with autopsy scenes of the young woman\u2019s corpse: a truly chilling juxtaposition.Izabela (Eva Ras) works on the switchboard alongside her friend Ruza (Ruzica Sokic), a job fraught with the symbolism of connection and communication. They are always having to fend off the approaches of Mica (Miodrag Andric), a guy who delivers telegrams on his motorbike. Walking on the streets one day, Izabela and Ruza run into Ahmed (Slobodan Aligrudic), a charmingly shy young man and a Muslim; he drolly refers to himself as a \u201cTurk\u201d. Later when he gets Izabela pregnant, he cheerfully says: \u201cYou\u2019ll bear me a little Turkish janissary!\u201d They begin a fervent affair, and more or less move in together in Izabela\u2019s little flat, but when she is left alone for a month while Ahmed is away, her yearning physical dissatisfactions are exploited by Mica.The film is about politics, sex and death. Or mostly sex and death. Or mostly sex. Sex is the great rebellion in this film, and the great warning. Izabela is killed by a male figure who for all his own unorthodoxy and boozy indiscipline is a submissive follower of the party line. Sex can be an apolitical form of conflict; it does not explicitly exist in opposition to the government, but the erotic mode is revolutionary by its very nature. This film is a short, sharp shock of exhilaration and artistic dissent. Love Affair, or The Case of the Missing Switchboard Operator is available from 17 August on Klassiki.","169":"\u2018Zo reken\u201d means \u201cshark bones\u201d in Haitian Creole, and refers to a traditional cane liquor purported to increase virility. It is also a local nickname for the Toyota Land Cruiser, a high-powered car that can breezily weather the tough road conditions in Port-au-Prince. Largely shot in the back of one of these vehicles, Emanuel Licha\u2019s documentary is structured around a steady flow of conversations on national identity, political conflicts and foreign intervention.Emerging from these discussions is discontent at the government of Jovenel Mo\u00efse \u2013 the country\u2019s former president who was assassinated in 2021 \u2013 as well as a distrust of international humanitarian aid. One passenger, for example, laments on the irony of how support from NGOs has had the negative effect of increasing Haiti\u2019s dependence on wealthier countries. Once the funding dries up and the medical volunteers depart, existing healthcare infrastructure is left worse for wear. And while the interior of the \u201czo reken\u201d feels like a safe space for spirited debate, the camera also peeks through the windows to observe the tumultuous reality outside. Traffic stops are crowded with vagrants, and talk of young men being gunned down emerges from the winding streets.Used by NGOs as well as the Haitian police, the Toyota Land Cruiser is itself a thorny symbol of power \u2013 even oppression. Zo Reken succeeds in dissecting this paradox, though the fly-on-the-wall style evidences a lack of self-interrogation on the film-makers\u2019 part. Like the aid workers, Licha and many of the crew are outsiders, and Zo Reken was also produced with international funding. In other words, the film\u2019s very existence is entangled within the same problematic structures criticised by its Haitian interviewees. If this complex position had been touched upon, this portrait of Haiti might have stretched beyond what is immediately visible in front of the camera. Zo Reken is available from 18 August on True Story.","170":"The much-loved animation series from Ireland\u2019s Cartoon Saloon (Wolfwalkers, Song of the Sea) gets a big-screen spinoff, which will be welcome news for preschool puffin fans and for parents who fancy losing themselves in a gentle, gorgeously animated balm of a film. Minor peril comes in the form of seagulls eyeing an unprotected little egg. But the real threat is climate change in this entry-level eco-parable: Puffin Rock welcomes a community of refugee puffins whose habitats have been ravaged by storms. And, after a few misunderstandings and some egg-based jeopardy, Oona the puffin and her little brother Baba find some new buddies.","171":"The very public ill will between Alex (Taylor Zakhar Perez), the son of the president of the US, and Britain\u2019s Prince Henry (Nicholas Galitzine), second in line to the throne, threatens to cause an international incident. But the urgent public relations damage control exercise has unforeseen consequences: the two become firm friends, and then much more.This adaptation of a bestselling novel by Casey McQuiston is so slick and polished, it feels obsessively micro-managed rather than directed. It\u2019s an approach that makes for a glossily accessible piece of YA fluff, at the expense of much in the way of personality. Fortunately, the twin charisma assault of the two leads adds considerably to the film\u2019s appeal. It turns out that watching two impossibly beautiful boys making cow eyes at each other might be just the escapist pulp we need right now.On Amazon Prime Video","172":"The 1983 indie-underground New York movie Variety, directed by Bette Gordon and scripted by Kathy Acker, is re-released for its 40-year anniversary. It is a flawed but fascinating critique of the male gaze, the porn gaze, and the luxurious ordeal of guilty voyeurism. Gordon casts a female lead, flipping gender assumptions and turning the tables on the underworld quest-torments of Paul Schrader\u2019s male heroes in the likes of Taxi Driver and Hardcore. Perhaps she was inspired by the mysterious inner life of the listless young woman played by Diahnne Abbott in Taxi Driver, working behind the porn-cinema concessions counter, irritated by Travis Bickle\u2019s inquiries about what candy she has: \u201cWhat you see is what we got.\u201dActor and film-maker Sandy McLeod plays Christine, a demure young middle-class woman from Michigan who is desperate for money after failing to get into media or publishing in Manhattan and falling behind on her rent. Prompted by her friend Nan (played by the artist and future photography star Nan Goldin), she takes a job tearing tickets in a scuzzy adult movie theatre near Times Square, ironically called Variety though it offers an unvarying bill of pornography. She finds herself strangely unsettled by the movies on offer, and by the attentions of Louie (Richard M Davidson), a wealthy older man she sees there \u2013 a rather classic porn-narrative situation, in fact. Luis Guzm\u00e1n plays Jose, an amiable guy who works at the cinema; Spalding Gray is the voice of a creep who leaves pervy messages on Christine\u2019s answering machine.Louie doesn\u2019t appear to be a creep in the normal run of things. He takes Christine on a date to a baseball game at Yankee Stadium (of all the old-fashioned things), where he seems to have a private box, taking her there in his own chauffeured car, making flirty conversation but basically behaving like a gentleman. Christine is piqued and slightly hurt when he says he has to leave and that his driver will take her home. She then becomes obsessed with Louie and what she thinks are his mafia connections to porn, and starts following him everywhere.The extended tailing and surveillance scenes I think are the weakest part of the film; we drift into some slightly hackneyed and derivative Coppola\/Conversation territory and \u2026 well, yes \u2026 Louie is probably a mobster or crook, but so what? Did we think anything else? The strongest scenes are the weirdest: Christine keeps confiding about this awful new job she has to her male friend Mark (Will Patton), with horribly vivid descriptions of how the auditorium reeks of Lysol disinfectant when it opens for business first thing in the morning. Then she disgusts and scares him by zoning out into a reverie mid-conversation, speaking aloud her weird porn fantasies as if in a trance. It is genuinely really strange, one of those extended dialogue scenes and two-shot scenes that indie movies did in those days, with semi-improv dialogue that could ramble on for ever and yet keep your attention.There are also of course the archival scenes of New York, with the ambient sound recording of the era giving us a ghostly honking in the distance. A single static shot of Times Square traffic with nothing happening had me on the edge of my seat. Part of what is so strange about the \u201cporn theatre\u201d genre is its comment on city design; in those days, in New York or indeed London, porn theatres (on sites now occupied by Starbucks outlets and Gap stores) just stood there, in or near the respectable commercial centre in all their unacknowledged squalor.Variety is a sharp, fierce, engaged piece of work.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotion Variety is released on 11 August in UK cinemas","173":"I tend to wince whenever I hear a film introduced as a blend of comedy and tragedy \u2013 not because it\u2019s a bad combination, but because it\u2019s one of the hardest to get right. So many artists attempt to tickle our funny bones while hitting us where it hurts, and so many come up short. Actor turned film-maker Mark Leonard Winter gives it a noble crack in his directorial debut The Rooster, a bumpy outdoorsy drama about two broken men \u2013 a cop and a hermit \u2013 connecting and potentially healing through the deployment of pensive stares and introspective dialogue, performed in Australian bush settings.The film\u2019s core dynamic works in contrasts, pairing Phoenix Raei\u2019s sullen cop Dan with a violently loud recluse played by Hugo Weaving. The latter\u2019s grubby look and sheer hermitness reminded me of Paul Dano in Swiss Army Man, the so-called \u201cboner corpse movie\u201d starring Daniel Radcliffe as the corpse and Dano as a filthy outcast who lugs it around. I\u2019m not sure whether that rather idiosyncratic picture (from the directors of Everything Everywhere All at Once) ruined my appetite for off-the-grid films about men bonding, or whether it renewed my appreciation of ones that don\u2019t follow its lead (no corpses, no boners).Winter\u2019s production does include a dead body: one of Dan\u2019s childhood friends. In an early scene, Dan tenderly cups the dead man\u2019s face with his hands and gets in close, pressing his nose against the corpse\u2019s. Circumstances around the death cause Dan great guilt and anguish, so he acts on a desire all of us have had at some point in our lives: he runs off into the woods and says arrivederci to civilised society.In the middle of nowhere, he bumps into Weaving\u2019s slobbering fiend, who tells him to bugger off because \u201cthis is my forest\u201d. But Dan has booze. The hermit likes booze. So the pair sit and talk. Their relationship is fractious and their friendship hard-earned. Several times the hermit pushes Dan away, but you know this isn\u2019t going to stick because you can feel the film bringing them together. Everything is predicated on their union. When Dan asks the hermit what line of work he\u2019s in \u2013 as if he\u2019s speaking to some guy on LinkedIn \u2013 the hermit responds: \u201cContemplation.\u201d This is a good example of how Winter (who also wrote the screenplay) segues into comedy: with moments that are slightly coy and knowing, but never enough to undercut the characters\u2019 emotions.Contemplation also describes the tone of Winter\u2019s direction. The Rooster is nothing if not ponderous and doesn\u2019t hurry towards anything \u2013 including introducing Weaving. When his character arrives we\u2019re grateful, because Weaving provides the kick the film needs. Winter, no doubt influenced by his work in front of the camera, is generous to his cast, affording them meaty monologues and airy sequences, although not always to the film\u2019s benefit.Raei\u2019s leading performance is admirably subtle in some respects, but his presence isn\u2019t quite enough to carry the film through its many quiet moments. We spend lots of time alone with Dan, yet his story still feels only partially told. None of the scenes that focus on Dan alone slip, but they get long and windy, with too much oxygen in the frame.Weaving is the film\u2019s sledgehammer, smashing the quietude to bits. He\u2019s the chalk to Raei\u2019s cheese. The veteran performer gets the colourful part and it\u2019s his grimy, grizzled face that will come to mind after the credits roll. The Rooster is not top tier in the actor\u2019s oeuvre, but watching him experiment and push the drama into more dynamic directions provides the film\u2019s key appeal. As a \u201cHugo Weaving goes feral in the bush\u201d movie, The Rooster delivers. As an exploration of masculinity and a drama about two men connecting, it\u2019s decent but unexceptional.The Rooster is currently screening as part of Melbourne international film festival. A general release date is yet to be announced.","174":"Here is another sociologically buttressed Spanish-language gothic horror to file alongside The Devil\u2019s Backbone and The Orphanage. With this film set near 1980s Tarragona, director V\u00edctor Garc\u00eda (who has the ninth Hellraiser film, from 2011, on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9) draws on a convincing period setting to nourish his scare story \u2013 even if the shocks aren\u2019t especially chilling, and the sense of claustrophobic entrapment in the milieu is undermined by a cop-out open ending.Teenager Sara (Carla Campra) is newly arrived in town, and struggling to adjust to this backwater with its stifling piety and social snobbery. After letting off some steam at a club with her hothead pal Rebe (Aina Qui\u00f1ones) and hitching a lift back with a pair of local bad boys, they almost crash when a spectral girl in a communion dress runs in front of their car. Obviously Chucky hadn\u2019t come out in Spain at this point, because they walk away with her creepy, pucker-faced communion doll. A mottled infection begins spreading up Sara\u2019s arm, and she begins experiencing appalling visions in broad daylight.In truth, these flashbacks \u2013 of being drowned in a well by a hideous putrefying revenant \u2013 prod us with the horror stick somewhat unsubtly. Much more intriguing is the social context supplied by Garc\u00eda and fellow writers Guillem Clua and Alberto Marini, as Sara learns she is not the first person in the town to be afflicted. This malaise seems to run historically through the teenage population \u2013 like the classic Charles Burns comic Black Hole \u2013 but its source, and the illness\u2019s metaphorical meaning, is not obvious.It could be social conformity, and as Sara, Rebe and hunky greaser Pedro (Marc Soler) track down what happened to the original communion girl, all roads seem to be leading towards the Catholic church. But Garc\u00eda, perhaps hoping to start a franchise, is strangely reluctant to fully nail the story shut. It feels like a compromise that squanders the carefully layered social dynamics and uniformly strong acting, full of hormonal Sturm und Drang. The Communion Girl is available on Shudder on 11 August","175":"This is frankly a shonky bit of exploitative nonsense that, in a way, recalls the classic horror films that feminist film theorist Carol J Clover wrote about so perceptively in her foundational tome Men, Women and Chainsaws. Such films \u2013 in this case, on an island where vile rich men espousing misogynist views hunt down and kill the women they\u2019ve trafficked there \u2013 only to turn the tables in the last act when the \u201cfinal girls\u201d triumph so that female viewers might experience a cathartic thrill of vengeance.That said, one gets the impression that the film-makers on Hunt Club, starting with screenwriters David Lipper (who has a supporting role here) and John Saunders, and director Elizabeth Blake-Thomas, aren\u2019t taking any of this that seriously. The film seems to revel in the low-budget tackiness of it all, caking the underwear-clad extras in fake blood, and casting icons of schlock cinema (Mickey Rourke, Casper Van Dien) in key villainous roles.Former Starship Trooper of yore, Van Dien plays the big boss here, a character called Carter who sports cowboy hats and western-style shirts with complicated details; he hopes to raise his son Jackson (Will Peltz) to be a real man like him who will despise cis women, trans people, and anyone gay or even remotely gay adjacent. In a roadside diner, they meet Cassandra (Mena Suvari, who seems to have barely aged a day since the late 1990s when she starred opposite Kevin Spacey in American Beauty), who has just had a fight with her girlfriend Tessa (Maya Stojan).Lured by Carter\u2019s promise that she can take home $100k if she wins the hunt, Cassandra goes with the father and son to the island, along with a younger woman called Lexi (Jessica Belkin) who answered an online ad placed by Conrad (Lipper) and Teddy (Jason London) in order to earn tuition money as an escort. See, girls? No good can come from wanting to get an education. Suvari gives her character\u2019s displays of despair, fury and determination a bit of welly, especially when the time comes to fight Rourke, whose face looks more like a tenderised side of beef every year. Hopefully, casting agents may see this and offer Suvari a chance to do something more upmarket in the future. Hunt Club is released on 14 August on digital platforms","176":"This sweet, good-natured kids animation from Norway has impeccable Scandi values. It\u2019s a superhero cartoon with the egalitarian message that maybe superheroes aren\u2019t all they\u2019re cracked up to be: all me-me-me and obsessed with their own awesomeness. Wouldn\u2019t it be better if everyone pulled together as a community?Just Super is set in a small town, home to an 11-year-old girl called Hedvig (voiced by Reilley Ott). The big secret in Hedvig\u2019s family is that for generations the eldest child becomes the town\u2019s superhero, Super Lion. Hedvig\u2019s dad, a strapping specimen of Viking manliness (Jean Luc Julien), is the current incarnation. All the Super Lions wear the same costume that has been handed down since the year dot, a ribbed wool onesie in beige that magnifies the wearer\u2019s natural skills into superpowers.The trouble for little Hedvig is that she doesn\u2019t appear to have any skills to magnify. She\u2019s not strong or clever, and she trips over her own feet. Hedvig\u2019s dad wonders if the woolly costume should instead go to her show-offy cousin. The good news is that Norway being one of the safest countries in the world, most of the town\u2019s emergencies seem lemur-related (one of the little critters has escaped from the zoo). The low-level stakes make Just Super a gentle watch for little kids.And there\u2019s a lot to like. Perhaps owing to the fact that Norway \u2013 that gleaming northern utopia \u2013 is one of the world\u2019s most equal as well as safest countries, it feels feminist by instinct; no annoyingly laboured girl power on show here. Less original is the \u201cbe yourself\u201d message, which even five-year-olds kids may groan at. And at points I did wonder if it\u2019s a teeny bit lacking in fun. Like a week of eating lentils, you know it\u2019s good for you, but a little bit of dullness creeps in. Just Super is released on 4 August in UK cinemas.","177":"With the iconic 1995 Ghost in the Shell in their locker, Japan\u2019s Production IG studio has been a long way ahead of the curve on the now-inescapable AI and cybernetics front. This high-minded, operatic conspiracy-thriller anime, released for the Psycho-Pass franchise\u2019s 10th anniversary, won\u2019t do their reputation any harm. Often insightful about the dark impulses behind humankind\u2019s need to delegate and cede to technology, it does a better job than most concept-drunk anime of parsing these philosophical musings into something semi-intelligible.In the dystopia of 2118, the Psycho-Pass is a Chinese-style social-credit chit given to every Japanese citizen assessing their psychological state and likelihood of breaking bad, all overseen for the good of social order by a benign AI called the Sibyl System. Inspector Tsunemori (voiced by Kana Hanazawa) is called in after the murder at sea of a researcher who is developing datasets related to ethnic conflicts abroad. With technologically quelled Japan debating how much it should intervene in chaotic countries outside its borders \u2013 hence the data\u2019s value \u2013 a host of other government departments want to weigh in on the incident. Especially when the finger for the killing points to the Peacebreakers, a rogue covert ops unit led by a Kurtz-style fanatic.As Tsunemori and her partner Kogami (Tomokazu Seki) juggle these competing interests, director Naoyoshi Shiotani \u2013 a Psycho-Pass stalwart \u2013 ensures this noirish affair resonates with a packed zeitgeist tick-list: Japan\u2019s historical isolation, current rearmament discussions, the interplay of determinism and free will in choosing how much tech should be incorporated into daily life. It is thought-provoking, but, to be honest, never deeply engaging as the hastily characterised central duo are subsumed into a horde of powerbrokers and apparatchiks.Whether 22nd-century gumshoe, sinister G-man or renegade cyborg, everyone in Psycho-Pass Providence looks noble, pallid and fabulous \u2013 and the action, mixing in CGI elements, has self-assurance. But, amid all the long gun battles in institutional hallways, there is no really outstanding set piece, and Shiotani turns in circles a bit too much around his obvious influence, Blade Runner (and, to a lesser extent, Minority Report). One highlight though is how his team draw hand-to-hand combat: precise, methodical and bristling, as if supporting the film\u2019s message that the human touch is still worth something. Psycho-Pass Providence is released on 2 August in UK and Irish cinemas.","178":"Sometimes a hat festooned with plastic straws, Christmas tree baubles and random trash is more than just a hat festooned with plastic straws, Christmas tree baubles and random trash: it\u2019s a political statement \u2013 well, sort of. This vivid, effervescent and often moving documentary revolves around David Faulk and Michael Johnstone, two artists who found each other in the middle of the Aids pandemic, fell in love and ended up building not just a life together but a wider community around the drag persona Mrs Vera.The latter is incarnated by Faulk, clad like a psychedelic Joan of Arc in an armour of upcycled polyester and tchotchkes, under a thick impasto of makeup \u2013 not unlike the inch-thick layers of paint he used to apply on canvases back in his days as a New York-based artist. But once he moved to San Francisco and started making art with life partner Johnstone, the expanding Verasphere became about so much more than just performance. It\u2019s a whole multimedia construction, involving Johnstone\u2019s luminous photographs, film-making, collaborations with friends and allies and, most endearing of all, craft workshops where Faulk and Johnstone teach people how to wield glue guns like real pros as prep for the city\u2019s annual Pride march. The couple\u2019s innate kindness and generosity shines bright, while the miracle of their survival (both have been HIV positive for years and Johnstone almost died) allowed them time to become local legends and fairy godmothers for the community.The entwined subjects are so lovable it\u2019s hard not to warm to the film, even if the direction (by Robert James) is very linear and conventional. Nevertheless, it modulates elegantly as it swerves between the story of Faulk and Johnstone as individuals and a condensed history of the post-Stonewall era, stitching together the rise of HIV and Aids, the Names Project Aids Memorial Quilt, and the queer scenes of New York\u2019s East Village and San Francisco\u2019s Castro Street. There\u2019s plenty of pithy input from Verasphere friends, including performance artist Annie Sprinkle and singer-actor Mark Trevorrow AKA Bob Downe. The Unabridged Mrs Vera\u2019s Daybook is released on 1 August on digital platforms.","179":"With its piles of white sheets and whirring machines, the inside of a hospital room can feel oddly impersonal under the cold fluorescent light. Giving a poignant warmth to this sterile environment, this compelling documentary from Lebanese director Corine Shawi intimately captures how her family comes together during a time of tragedy. Struck by sudden paralysis, her father, Andre, is confined to bed and Shawi\u2019s film grapples with this state of reduced mobility as well as her own emotional stasis, caught between the past, the present and the future.As it examines Andre\u2019s hospital room, the camera tenderly observes how the space is transformed into a second home. Containers of food lovingly prepared by Shawi\u2019s mother are stacked by the bed, while the radio hums his favourite songs. The film does not shy away from moments of uncomfortable friction, either, as Andre\u2019s frustration and Shawi\u2019s helplessness erupt in arguments and sudden emotional outbursts. However, as Andre braves lengthy sessions of physical therapy with a smiling resilience, it is Shawi, not her father, who needs more courage to deal with this difficult new reality.This brings us back to the film\u2019s beautifully enigmatic title, which gets at the heart of Shawi\u2019s crisis. During one particularly momentous conversation, Shawi\u2019s sister advises that she should also follow her own dreams, instead of being tethered to the needs of their admirably self-sufficient parents. Like the film\u2019s recurring images of a hand peeling off dried tree-bark to reveal a fresh surface underneath, the film appears to seek the same kind of renewal. Perhaps What I Fear Does Not Exist is available from 4 August on True Story.","180":"Parisian film-maker and illustrator C\u00e9line Devaux, whose award-winning shorts have been shown at Cannes and Venice, now makes her feature debut with a salty romcom character study; it is deceptively slight, though leaning heavily on a certain kind of quirkiness, and undoubtedly intriguing.Jeanne is an entrepreneur who has fallen into a depression caused by the death of her mother and the recent bizarre collapse of her business; she has an inner anxiety-voice represented by Devaux\u2019s own sketches of the cartoon-ghost in her head, always nagging at her. An undersea device for hoovering up microplastics, into which Jeanne invested every cent of her own money, became unmoored and Jeanne was humiliatingly shown on the TV news as she desperately dived fully clothed into the sea in a doomed attempt to save it. She is played by Blanche Gardin \u2013 who was L\u00e9a Seydoux\u2019s producer and best friend in Bruno Dumont\u2019s media satire France \u2013 and brings a certain kind of not-yet-irretrievable jadedness to the role.Jeanne can now rescue herself from bankruptcy by selling her late mother\u2019s Lisbon flat, a place with so many painful memories \u2013 but in journeying to Portugal she has to deal with her slightly louche ex-boyfriend Vitor (Nino Lopes). At the airport she meets a very strange guy called Jean (Laurent Lafitte) \u2013 apparently a school contemporary \u2013 who says some bold, odd, and yet weirdly seductive things to her.At first, it seems that this is going to be extremely ironic comedy about a creepy acquaintance from schooldays, or even a psychological thriller in the vein of Dominik Moll\u2019s Harry, He\u2019s Here to Help. But in his unfiltered, unguarded way, Jean opens up about mental health issues that seem far from resolved (he actually steals a motorbike in the course of the action without getting into trouble, an interestingly transgressive scene).The movie just rolls along, with entertaining setpiece scenes about Jean, Vitor and Jeanne\u2019s amiable brother Simon (Maxence Tual). The film also uses children \u2013 Simon\u2019s son, and Jean\u2019s niece \u2013 with great charm and Jeanne\u2019s vulnerabilities are tenderly portrayed. Everybody Loves Jeanne is released on 27 July on Mubi in the UK and on 7 September in Australian cinemas.","181":"Baato \u2013 \u201cthe path\u201d in Nepali \u2013 is the extraordinary journey taken annually by villagers living in rural Nepal, as they transport huge bundles of medicinal herbs to the city of Dharan for sale. Following a tradition that has existed for more than a century, Mikma and her family cover a distance of 300 miles by foot over five arduous days. Wrapped around steep and rocky mountains, the trails are treacherous and gruelling, while the obstacles they face are more than physical: they have to deal with administrative hassle, corruption and infrastructure development.Closely following this resilient group of travellers \u2013 which largely consists of women carrying enormous loads on their shoulders with astonishing ease \u2013 the film draws a striking contrast between the scenery of Nepali highlands and the intimate dynamics of Mikma\u2019s family. As they take the occasional breaks for food and rest, their spirited conversations attest to the growing tension between tradition and modernity. The absence of young men on these annual treks is a prime example of this tug-and-pull; many have left the village for a brighter economic future elsewhere.More than a family portrait, Lucas Millard and Kate Stryker\u2019s film also widens its scope to take in the complex geopolitics of Nepal. The generational shifts are not only felt within the community, but also embedded in the changing landscapes that surround the villagers. The (very) slow construction of a new highway promises greater accessibility to metropolitan areas and new employment opportunities, but the project comes with the threat of displacement and inadequate compensation for rural dwellers. Baato is released on 28 July in UK cinemas.","182":"The biggest question I had going into director Poppy Stockell\u2019s documentary about the beloved Australian singer John Farnham is: how many times will it deploy that song? You know, the one reminding us that we\u2019re all someone\u2019s daughter, we\u2019re all someone\u2019s son. The song that arrived in 1986 and became seared on to the national psyche, to be played and replayed ad infinitum, and may God curse the swinish face of any so-called \u2019Strayan who doesn\u2019t like it.Will You\u2019re the Voice be played once? Twice? Will it be reserved for the last act? How long can we look at each other keep watching a Farnesy doco without hearing this amazingly catchy tune about standing up to injustice? The answer is: about halfway through the runtime. But even then we hear the song in pieces, as the story around it is recounted.The tone of Finding the Voice is fawning: this is one of those gushy accounts of music history in which almost everybody has the Midas touch, and almost everybody is a legend and\/or talking about a legend. It\u2019s also one in which any serious exploration of the subject\u2019s vices or moral failings are no-fly zones. The film is an authorised work with Farnham\u2019s blessing \u2013 though he did not participate in an on-screen interview and is only occasionally heard, via audio that combines an interview conducted for the film with archival material.Stockell opens with vision of Australian society from the 1960s, accompanied by Olivia Newton-John describing the country at this time as \u201csheltered\u201d and \u201cvery isolated from the rest of the world\u201d. The film quickly segues into discussing music, with images of bars, clubs and nightlife chased by Jimmy Barnes asking: \u201cWho was gonna be our big star? Who were we gonna worship?\u201dThe singer Bev Harrell describes Farnham as a \u201cstar in the making\u201d. This kind of language is often used when discussing famous musicians, as if their success was preordained and not \u2013 as is most often the case \u2013 a combination of talent, luck and opportunity. Music producer David Mackay discusses how he convinced a young Farnham to record Sadie (The Cleaning Lady) because Mackay \u201cknew it\u2019d be No 1\u201d. And voil\u00e0! This sad song, incongruously performed in a jovial spirit, became the biggest hit from an Australian recording artist in the 1960s.The ghost of poor ol\u2018 Sadie returned to haunt Farnham; she made him a star but not a respectable artist. Finding the Voice includes a section that recounts how Farnham was dropped by his record company and bottomed out doing crummy gigs with a band that couldn\u2019t even keep time (when the inevitable biopic or miniseries arrives, this will be perfect for the dramatic curve downwards). But Farnham had the chance to turn the pages over (thank you, thank you) and took it when he discovered You\u2019re the Voice, written by Chris Thompson, Andy Qunta, Keith Reid and Maggie Ryder.Thompson says he got the idea for the song when he overslept and missed a big march against nuclear disarmament (classic muso behaviour). He KBed Farnham\u2019s request to record it, saying: \u201cI said no, no! The only thing I knew about John Farnham was a song about Sadie the Cleaning Lady.\u201d But Farnham and his team went ahead and recorded it anyway, among other things becoming the first time in human history that bagpipes have sounded almost tolerable. Here the story\u2019s dramatic arc tilts up, up and up, towards massive crowds and superstardom.Finding the Voice has a very good energy and flow: editors Scott Gray and Steven Robinson make it fast and jumpy, like someone bouncing around at a concert. But it also keeps tumbling past bits that might\u2019ve added more meat to the bone, reducing potentially interesting tangents to quick soundbites. Lines such as \u201cJohn doesn\u2019t like parties or gatherings\u201d beg to be further explored, as does his depression, which is alluded to a few times but never properly addressed.Interviewees talk on behalf of Farnham, with commentary like \u201che was for the first time in control of his career and really he couldn\u2019t be happier\u201d. The vibes are a bit weird, as if the subject is no longer with us. While an authorised production, this film imparts an impression that Farnham contributed little to it. By the end we have a good overview of his career but not the man himself. Who is he? What are his values, insecurities, weaknesses, strengths? Farnham found his voice, but it\u2019s not really in this film.John Farnham: Finding The Voice airs at 7.30pm on Monday 24 July on Channel 7 and will be available to stream on 7plus, and is released on 1 August on digital platforms in the UK","183":"Pop\u2019s perpetual Peter Pan Mark Ronson has assembled this glitzy doll\u2019s house of pop royalty to soundtrack this summer\u2019s biggest movie blockbuster, co-writing five tracks himself and producing a handful more. Viewed simply as an ensemble mixtape, it shines like a kaleidoscope in 20 shades of coral. But the accompanying film feels as though it\u2019s straining to live its truth as a fully fledged musical, and as a result a few of the soundtrack\u2019s starry contributors \u2013 Sam Smith, Tame Impala, Haim \u2013 can\u2019t seem to decide whether they\u2019re serving the gods of pop or narrative. Still, Ronson touches glory with the 11 o\u2019clock number I\u2019m Just Ken, launching Ryan Gosling\u2019s pitch-corrected himbo into full masculine meltdown.For all the Midas touch he exhibits on Dua Lipa\u2019s Dance the Night, Ronson the songwriter lacks a requisite sprinkling of saccharine camp for a job like this. Fortunately, this ingredient is amply lavished elsewhere: in the beeping BPMs of PinkPantheress and Ava Max, the gloriously artificial K-pop regiment Fifty Fifty, and the merciless hit merchant Charli XCX belting her irresistibly idiotic bop Speed Drive.Then just when it starts to feel like an orgy in a sweetshop, Billie Eilish arrives with some much-needed tragic relief. What Was I Made For? lends hushed sincerity to Barbie\u2019s plight, and it\u2019s this melody that Greta Gerwig repeatedly relies on to give her synthetic film a heart.Like the movie it decorates, the album strives for a fine balance of girlish innocence and knowing irony. Nicki Minaj long ago mastered this contradiction: half hyper-feminine babydoll, half foul-mouthed man-eater. So it\u2019s no surprise that Barbie World, the song she shares with her protege Ice Spice, is 109 seconds of pure plastic bliss. Like much of the soundtrack, it fizzes with moreish, sugary filth, simultaneously R-rated and child-friendly.","184":"The sequel to Bird Box, Susanne Bier\u2019s hit 2018 Netflix sci-fi starring Sandra Bullock, Bird Box: Barcelona transposes pretty much the same premise \u2013 parent and child must seek out a safe haven from mysterious entities that cause overwhelming suicidal urges if you lay eyes on them \u2013 to a post-apocalyptic version of Barcelona. Mario Casas plays Sebasti\u00e1n, a doting father who is driven to desperate acts out of love for his daughter, Anna (Alejandra Howard).This instalment is co-written and directed by Spain\u2019s Pastor brothers, who are old hands when it comes to dystopian science-fiction scenarios triggered by preposterous events. Their 2013 feature The Last Days hinged on a viral epidemic that caused a paralysing fear of open spaces; Carriers (2009) followed four friends seeking refuge from an airborne plague. With Bird Box: Barcelona, as with any film of this outlandish ilk, suspension of disbelief and an appreciation of propulsively destructive action sequences is key. Just don\u2019t expect too many fresh ideas.On Netflix","185":"Prime minister Narendra Modi\u2019s India is a country that is both fiercely patriotic and increasingly divided. Stirred up by wasps\u2019 nest rhetoric and stoked by a news media that regurgitates the Modi position wholesale, it is not a country that takes kindly to anyone who dares hold the ruling party to account.But a few courageous journalists persist in asking questions. Ravish Kumar, at the time of filming a television anchor and reporter for the station NDTV and the subject of this nerve-jangling documentary, is one. Captured by a jittery camera, the measured, eloquent Kumar calls out the propaganda that passes for news. He resists militaristic cheerleading to focus instead on the human stories \u2013 the job losses, the lack of basic infrastructure, the rubbish that piles up in the streets. Meanwhile, moments of peace with his young daughter are interrupted by his phone, delivering a torrent of death threats and accusations of \u201canti-nationalism\u201d. And his underfunded newsroom haemorrhages staff members.This is tense, essential film-making that argues for the importance of serious, balanced journalism in today\u2019s world of factional infotainment, while also showing the cost to those who stand against the tide.","186":"With its squishy synth soundtrack, candy-coloured teen environs and role-playing girl-gang violence, this second feature from Brazilian writer-director Anita Rocha da Silveira feels like a time-warped precursor to Heathers, Clueless and The Neon Demon. It\u2019s a satirical nightmare inspired by the giallo of Dario Argento, fired by the rise of former president Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s reactionary populism and campily refracted through the televangelising aesthetic of The Eyes of Tammy Faye. Having racked up a string of international festival prizes (Miami, Troms\u00f8, Sitges, San Sebasti\u00e1n) since premiering at Cannes in 2021, Medusa builds on the promise of Da Silveira\u2019s genre-subverting 2015 feature debut, Kill Me Please, confirming its creator as a killer talent to watch.We open with a video of spider-walking strangeness; a writhing dance watched on a phone by a black-fingernailed figure who is promptly set upon by masked female assailants. \u201cJezebel! We\u2019ll nail you to the cross,\u201d they cry, before beating their victim into promising to \u201caccept Jesus\u2026 [and] become a devoted, virtuous woman\u201d, then posting her bloodied submission online. These are the \u201cTreasures\u201d, a cheesy evangelical vocal group with a sideline in biblical violence, whose male counterparts the \u201cWatchmen\u201d train for morality-police duties with peacocking capoeira routines. While news reports about blackouts and rationing burble away in the background, these soldiers of God (who echo real-life Brazilian vigilantes, male and female) fight the good fight against progressive society with a twisted fervour reminiscent of the frothing QAnon insurrectionists who stormed the US Capitol on 6 January in 2021.Behind the Treasures\u2019 assaults is the quasi-mythical story of Melissa, a free spirit who \u201ctainted our town\u201d by doing a nude scene in a movie, and whose face was subsequently set on fire by an anonymous avenging angel. Permanently scarred, Melissa disappeared from view. Now Mariana (Mari Oliveira) vows to track her down \u2013 an endeavour in which she is encouraged by queen bee Michele (Lara Tremouroux), who posts online tutorials on burning issues such as \u201chow to take a perfect Christian selfie\u201d. Agreeing that a snapshot of Melissa\u2019s melted face would be a warning to sinners everywhere, Mariana goes undercover, infiltrating a home for coma patients. But once inside the institution\u2019s cloistered corridors, she discovers (like the heroine of Suspiria before her) more than she bargained for.Da Silveira has described the body-fascist protagonists of her film, one of whom loses her beauty-industry job because \u201clooks are everything\u201d, as having been indoctrinated with \u201ca form of control\u201d \u2013 a desperate attempt to master their desires that \u201cstarts through their own bodies and extends to the bodies of others\u201d. It\u2019s a neat metaphor for the suffocating zealousness that orders these disordered lives \u2013 an obsessive need to smother carnal urges and temptations beneath a veneer of steely sanctity. No wonder everyone\u2019s smile teeters on the brink of a scream, just as horror skirts the edges of satire.From the masks of Georges Franju\u2019s Les yeux sans visage (Eyes Without a Face) to the mass hysteria of Ken Russell\u2019s The Devils and the strutting street violence of Stanley Kubrick\u2019s A Clockwork Orange, Da Silveira fills the screen with nods to a cine-literate heritage of cult classics, updated for the Instagram age. Demonstrating a keen ear for a twisted pop tune (Wishing on a Star is weirdly weaponised; Baby It\u2019s You is painted black) and a sharp eye for piercingly orchestrated visuals (plaudits to director of photography Jo\u00e3o Atala), she deftly conjures a 21st-century parable about misogyny, hypocrisy and political chicanery, all dressed in the enjoyably outre clothing of Lynchian dream-logic horror.Yet for all its multitudinous reference points, this remains very much Da Silveira\u2019s movie \u2013 as distinct and pointed as Ana Lily Amirpour\u2019s A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night or Julia Ducournau\u2019s Raw\u00ad \u2013 a genre film with something to say, and a unique voice with which to say it.","187":"A pair of Japanese teenagers are flung together thanks to a metaphysical glitch that bends the rules of space and time in this sumptuously romantic YA anime. And if this all sounds suspiciously close to the premise of Makoto Shinkai\u2019s box-office phenomenon Your Name, that\u2019s unlikely to be a coincidence. The success of that film \u2013 Your Name was the third highest-grossing Japanese film of all time \u2013 led to a rash of similarly high concept sci-fi romance animations (most recently Shinkai\u2019s own esoteric fantasy Suzume) hoping to repeat the magic. But of all the movies that followed, Tomohisa Taguchi\u2019s The Tunnel to Summer, the Exit of Goodbyes is the one that comes closest to recreating the glistening perfection of Your Name.Based on a novel and subsequent manga by Mei Hachimoku, the film follows Kaoru (voiced by Oji Suzuka), a reserved high school student who discovers a mysterious tunnel that, according to local folklore, can grant your dearest wishes, albeit at a considerable cost. Around the same time, a friendship sparks with the new girl at school, Anzu (Marie Iitoyo), who shares his fascination with the tunnel. Anzu is an unrepentant badass, an aspiring manga artist who floors the school mean girl with a punch on her first day in class, and accuses the flustered Kaoru of being a creep.This elegant romance anchors its more far-fetched plot points with delicately observed details and grounding moments: a battered, borrowed umbrella that becomes a motif in the story; shy, stolen glances exchanged through floppy fringes; fingers tentatively entwined as the sky explodes with fireworks and longing.","188":"The latest animation from Pixar takes a high-concept setup \u2013 a sprawling metropolis, Element City, in which the residents, all made of either fire, water, air or earth, live in strictly segregated neighbourhoods \u2013 to explore a universal theme: the need for cultural acceptance and harmony. At the heart of the story is a star-crossed romance between hot-headed fire girl Ember (voiced by Leah Lewis) and sappy, sweet-natured water guy Wade (Mamoudou Athie). And perhaps it\u2019s ludicrous to complain about the authenticity of a relationship between a woman made of flame and an entirely liquid man, but there\u2019s little persuasive chemistry between them. There are tonal parallels with Pixar\u2019s Inside Out and Zootropolis, but while it has a peppy visual energy, Elemental lacks the wildly inventive storytelling of the former and the laughs of the latter.","189":"Born profoundly deaf in Iraqi Kurdistan, Lawand had little hope of a fulfilling life if he stayed in the country of his birth. His disability was stigmatised, and there was no infrastructure in place to support him. With their son\u2019s wellbeing in mind, his parents made the wrenching decision to make the perilous journey to the UK with the then five-year-old Lawand and his older brother Rawa. There, Lawand was enrolled at the Royal School for the Deaf in Derby, and he thrived, achieving fluency in British Sign Language, making friends. Then the unthinkable happened: Lawand and his family were threatened with deportation.Even without documentary director Edward Lovelace\u2019s inventive approach, this would be a potent and powerful story. But what\u2019s particularly impressive is the way that, through immersive techniques involving sound, and skittish editing that evokes fractured, traumatic memory snippets, the film tries to capture Lawand\u2019s lived experience. It\u2019s a remarkable achievement, a film that, with its poetic sensitivity and creativity, has a strong kinship with Peter Middleton and James Spinney\u2019s Notes on Blindness.","190":"There\u2019s a claustrophobic, smothering love between sex worker Fatimah-Zahra (Aicha Tebbae) and her teenage son Selim (Abdellah El Hajjouji), both forced to live on the unforgiving periphery of Morocco\u2019s conservative society. It\u2019s the kind of close but fractious relationship that comes from being a self-contained, self-sufficient family unit \u2013 mother and son are constantly on the move, fleeing debts, disgrace or the scandal that seems to trail after Fatimah-Zahra like a cheap perfume. But now they are out of options, and, after a stormy reunion with Fatimah-Zahra\u2019s estranged family, Selim learns the uncomfortable truth about his paternity. His anger at his mother is scalding and destructive; it is, we sense, partly driven by the fact that Selim and Fatimah-Zahra are more alike than he would ever admit.Fyzal Boulifa\u2019s follow-up to his acclaimed debut Lynn + Lucy, The Damned Don\u2019t Cry is impressive on every level. The performances are full-blooded and lived in; the camera finds a painterly beauty even in moments of despair and squalor. And the score, a discordant duel between cello and harp, cleverly evokes the disharmony between mother and son.In cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema","191":"MI goes AI in this seventh outing for the TV-series-turned-action-cinema-franchise, a genuinely breathtaking romp that tops the previous Christopher McQuarrie-directed episodes (2015\u2019s Rogue Nation, 2018\u2019s Fallout) for sheer nailbiting spectacle and pulse-racing tension. The zeitgeisty plot may have holes through which you could drive the Orient Express, but for pure adrenaline rush entertainment this will leave you exhilarated and eager for more.Three decades ago, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) sold his soul to the IMF (\u201cno, the other IMF \u2013 the Impossible Mission Force\u201d), a covert organisation whose oath demands that its members \u201clive and die in the shadows for those we hold close and those we never meet\u201d. Since then, Hunt has saved the world more than once (his last mission involved neutralising nuclear bombs). But now he\u2019s up against everyone\u2019s favourite enemy de nos jours \u2013 a fiendish artificial intelligence known as \u201cthe Entity\u201d, a name that will sound sillier every time it is spoken out loud (and it is spoken out loud a lot).It\u2019s hardly a new idea. Jack Paglen\u2019s script for 2014\u2019s 70s-influenced Transcendence dramatised the \u201csingularity\u201d (the point at which technology out-thinks humankind) a decade ago, paving the way for MI7\u2019s sentient viral intelligence (\u201cthis thing has a mind of its own?!\u201d), which is \u201ceverywhere and nowhere\u2026 godless, stateless, amoral\u201d, controlling and manipulating information so that \u201ctruth as we know it is in peril\u201d.Somehow, this very modern threat has a very old-fashioned key \u2013 a weird, crucifix-shaped dongle that (like Archimedes\u2019s Antikythera in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny) has been split into two pieces that must be reunited to unlock its secrets. \u201cYour mission, should you choose to accept it, is to bring us the key,\u201d declares the familiar self-destructing tape, the IMF having apparently shunned new-fangled voicemail or encrypted WhatsApp messages. Later, they will retreat to the safety of an offline analogue room \u2013 the one place the Entity can\u2019t get to them.Warring forces wish to own the Entity, to control and weaponise it. Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) apparently holds part of the puzzle \u2013 which puts a price on her head, because \u201cthe fate of the world depends on finding whatever it unlocks\u201d \u2013 thus sending Hunt off in globetrotting pursuit. The pre-credits sequence alone takes us from a submarine in the Bering Strait to a horseback chase through the desert, en route to a sandstorm shootout with brief stopovers in Amsterdam and elsewhere. We also get an early reminder that we\u2019re back in a world in which rubbery masks are realistic enough to get Jason Statham believing in the Face\/Off machine again.There\u2019s plenty of caperish comedy afoot, particularly after Hunt teams up with Hayley Atwell\u2019s light-fingered Grace. A handcuffed car-chase featuring a Fiat 500 careening down Rome\u2019s Spanish Steps recalls the Mini-fuelled fun of The Italian Job (with a cheeky nod towards Battleship Potemkin), while the wisecracking interaction between Cruise and Atwell has a nice, old-school screwball flavour.Elsewhere, the join-the-dots plot includes a James Bond-style mission to a lavish party where a scene-stealingly cracked Vanessa Kirby warns that \u201ctruth is vanishing \u2013 war is coming\u201d, a prologue to a Don\u2019t Look Now-style chase through the alleyways of Venice. Esai Morales, who proved so chilling in Ozark, nails another villainous role as Gabriel, a \u201cdark messiah\u201d who is \u201cthe Entity\u2019s chosen messenger\u201d. As for Cruise, he may still have the physical fitness of a less-than-40-year-old, but he\u2019s also developed a Richard Gere-style blinky squint of late, which adds a touch of melancholy maturity to his otherwise boyish charm.The action is impressively gender neutral, with men and women killing and dying with equal relish (plaudits to Pom Klementieff, whose relentless \u2013 and largely silent \u2013 assassin, Paris, could give Grace Jones in A View to a Kill a run for her money). It all builds to a frankly jaw-dropping train-bound finale in which the heavily trailered sight of the real Tom Cruise really driving a real motorbike off a real mountaintop is only an appetiser for what is to come \u2013 one of the most audaciously extended action set pieces I have ever seen, which left my nails not so much bitten as gnawed to the bone. The fact that this is \u201conly the beginning\u201d is cause for celebration. Roll on Dead Reckoning Part Two.In cinemas from 10 July","192":"Subdued, low-key and unassuming, this Japanese film about a young deaf woman who becomes a professional boxer firmly eschews the traditional sports movie tropes. Based on a true story, it is resolutely unsentimental, taking a meditative and naturalistic approach to the tale of Keiko (Yukino Kishii). She isn\u2019t an obvious fighter. \u201cShe\u2019s small, she has no reach, she\u2019s not fast enough,\u201d says the owner of her gym, her biggest supporter, \u201cbut she\u2019s got heart.\u201d Even heart and dogged determination, however, might not be enough to keep Keiko going once the pandemic shuts the gym and self-doubt shakes her focus.In cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema","193":"Does the inside of a bookshop take on the personality of its owner? Or does a bookseller inevitably become a storyteller by a process of osmosis over the decades spent surrounded by the printed word? In the case of Matthew Tannenbaum, the subject of this quietly life-affirming documentary, it\u2019s almost impossible to pinpoint the place where the man ends and his treasure trove of a shop begins. The Bookstore in Lenox, Massachusetts, is a beloved local institution. Tannenbaum knows most of his customers by name. Those he doesn\u2019t recognise are treated like friends yet to be made. The decor is eclectic (there\u2019s a roll of Donald Trump toilet paper displayed); the shop\u2019s finances run on a wing and a prayer. Then comes the pandemic. The community support for the embattled shop surprises nobody, except, perhaps Tannenbaum, the ageing hippy whose love of literature is evident on every groaning shelf.In cinemas and on Apple TV+","194":"American high school is a shark pit at the best of times. But it\u2019s particularly tough if, like Ruby Gillman (voiced by Lana Condor), you are a member of a family of krakens \u2013 blue-skinned, tentacled, invertebrate sea creatures \u2013 who have been passing as human for the past 15 years. And while Ruby thought that negotiating prom was her main challenge, it turns out that her mother (Toni Collette) hasn\u2019t been entirely straight with her. Ruby has a monster-size problem.Key to understanding it all is the grandmother she never knew she had, a warrior queen of the ocean, voiced with relish by Jane Fonda. The latest picture from DreamWorks Animation is a likable if slight story of teen crises, which combines the adolescent body-morphing themes of Turning Red with the fish-out-of-water story of Luca, plus an amusing pot shot at mermaids, little and otherwise (take that, Disney!).","195":"Based on a true story, this slippery and rather disingenuous French-language thriller explores the case of Maureen Kearney (Isabelle Huppert, a little too impassive and icy), a high-powered union official for a major player in France\u2019s nuclear power industry. When Maureen gets wind of a deal that could lead to massive job losses in the sector, she unilaterally declares war on the powers that be, petitioning politicians and making some very powerful enemies in the process. But when Maureen is violently sexually assaulted in her own home, the initial sympathy and shock within the industry turns to suspicion when the police accuse her of faking the attack.It\u2019s not unusual, unfortunately, for the victims of sexual attacks to find themselves distrusted and even accused. What rankles in the film\u2019s approach is that the audience is also encouraged to question her story, with director Jean-Paul Salom\u00e9 seeding the picture with doubts about the veracity of Maureen\u2019s initial version of the events, even as it shows her vindicated in the end. It feels crass and manipulative to cast aspersions on the tale of a real-life rape victim in service of a narrative twist in a movie.","196":"Tracking down various segments of the Berlin Wall scattered all over the US, this eccentric yet down-to-earth documentary from Courtney Stephens and Pacho Velez traces how a historic artefact can mutate and splinter into myriad meanings. Transformed by their surroundings as well as the film-makers\u2019 gaze, these concrete slabs are more than a symbol of the cold war; they have come to represent something quintessentially American.From the midwest to California, state department halls to roadside restaurants, chunks of the wall can be found in the most unlikely of places. Most often positioned as a commemoration of history \u2013 and that loaded concept of \u201cfreedom\u201d \u2013 the fragments are occasionally entirely untethered from their context, re-erected decoratively inside a Microsoft office or in the home of a private collector.Using 16mm film stock, the documentary has the feel of William Eggleston\u2019s studies of mundane Americana. As the camera lingers on ordinary spaces such as a hotel lobby, the presence of a section of the wall is simultaneously bizarre and unremarkable. After all, there is nothing more American than the commodification of history.In addition to its offbeat locations, this cinematic road trip offers the film-makers\u2019 interactions with those who live or work around the edifices. One particularly revelatory sequence centres on a phone call between Stephens and the CIA; while denying the crew permission to film inside their headquarters in Langley, Virginia, the CIA representative segues unexpectedly into a candid suggestion that the end of the cold war left the organisation in existential limbo. Such conversations bring a human unpredictability to the solemn wreckage of history. The American Sector is available from 30 June on True Story.","197":"Sarvnik Kaur\u2019s patient, plangent documentary follows two fishers and friends from Mumbai\u2019s Koli community pursuing their livelihoods by different means. Ganesh is a likable grafter who commands a large crew and the latest technology for expeditions far out at sea. He lives in a modern apartment with his wife, Manali, and zooms around town in a van that has his Instagram handle \u2013 The Last Fisherman of Bombay \u2013 emblazoned on the side.In contrast, the humble Rakesh, who lives with his wife, Devyani, their baby son and his mother-in-law, adheres to traditional Koli methods, trusting in his ancestors and restricting himself to shallow waters and a modest boat. In nocturnal chats that punctuate the film, the cultural and economic chasm between the two men is exposed. Ganesh encourages his friend to broaden his horizons, but Rakesh\u2019s ambitions are limited to the dream of having a toilet at home.Kaur has said that, during production, one of her editors wanted to know who was the villain of the film. The strength of Against the Tide, though, lies in its even-handedness, its insistence that both men are at the mercy of the same capitalist and ecological catastrophes. Despite his poverty and his son\u2019s poor health, it is Rakesh who emerges as the more resolute of the two, finding succour in his spirituality. The blingy Ganesh, meanwhile, is drowning in debt and considering downsizing his operations. He is going to need a smaller boat.Kaur and her cinematographer, Ashok Meena, are alert to every possible tension and nuance, although it would have been nice to see some interaction, however brief, between Manali and Devyani. An especially poetic image early in the film appears to show Rakesh walking on water, but it is only a trick of the light; the dawn is glistening on the rippled wet sand as he strides across it while the tide is out, leaving beached boats far behind him. Even after our eyes adjust to reality, though, the aura of the miraculous lingers on. Against the Tide is released on 30 June at Bertha DocHouse, London, with an Australian release date to be confirmed.","198":"A decade\u2019s worth of the 8mm home videos of the French author and Nobel laureate Annie Ernaux forms the basis of this delicate and very personal documentary. Co-directed by Ernaux and her son, David Ernaux-Briot, it\u2019s a wisp of a thing, little more than an hour long. But Ernaux\u2019s lucid, perceptive narration brings a more profound significance to the scrappy, amateurish reels shot by her late ex-husband, Philippe Ernaux. The slow-motion breakdown of a family is tracked by a lens that initially sought out intimacy and celebration, but finds itself, as the years pass, increasingly distanced from figures caught in its time capsule of a frame.","199":"Two key elements are required if a sports documentary is to connect with audiences beyond the existing fans: a likable central character who has battled seemingly insurmountable odds to achieve success and a nail-biting final act. The Last Rider, Alex Holmes\u2019s account of American cyclist Greg LeMond\u2019s incredible triumph in the 1989 Tour de France, contains both. LeMond had previously won the gruelling race, in 1986, so he wasn\u2019t a complete outsider. However, he had nearly lost his life in a shooting accident in 1987 and been written off as a serious contender in the race. It\u2019s a conventional documentary, but a quality one. Spectacular archive footage from the event captures an inescapable sense of excitement \u2013 infectious, even to cycling agnostics in the audience \u2013 and interviews with LeMond and his wife, Kathy, are unexpectedly affecting.","200":"This silly but pleasingly jolly horror film offers an update on that perennial staple of the genre: the summer camp beset by a supernatural malignancy. And much like a campfire tale tailor-made to terrify impressionable listeners, this has a streak of self-referentiality that makes it feel ludic as well as lurid. After a 1940s-set prologue that\u2019s explained later, the story settles into the 1980s, a time when this sort of summer-fun-and-slashing package with a large ensemble cast was all the rage (see Sleepaway Camp, The Burning, and of course the Friday the 13th series).It\u2019s the last day of the season at Camp Briarbrook, and the assorted kids get ready to head home after one last performance-assembly in the mess hall. The camp counsellors, who predictably span the spectrum from theatre nerds and dweebs to glossy teen beauties ripe for terrorising, are also psyched to spend the night partying once the kids are gone. The camp\u2019s owners \u2013 paterfamilias Gilbert McCalister (William Sadler), his daughter (Cara Buono, Dr Miller in Mad Men), and her two sons Shawn (Tyler Elliot Burker) and Peter (Spencer List) \u2013 look on indulgently, little realising that by the end half of them will be murdered or at least traumatised one way or another. Is the mayhem caused by the undead spirit of camp nurse Agatha (Madeleine Dauer), who bears a grudge for things Gilbert did in the 1940s? Or is there a more quotidian explanation like bears, a hornets\u2019 nest or UFOs?Writer-director-editor Erik Bloomquist gamely takes the role of Danny, a lovelorn counsellor besotted with Kellie (Emily Keefe), and as anyone who\u2019s ever seen a summer camp horror movie knows desire is always a deadly emotion in these films. Bloomquist gets great performances from the younger element of the cast, who are clearly having the most fun ever marauding wantonly in the third act as if someone spiked the lemonade with every E number and sugar product known to humanity. But finger snaps are especially due to Dan Leahy who plays counsellor Ben, an out-and-proud theatre geek who can both quip like a queen and scream with terror convincingly, the full thespian range required by the material. She Came from the Woods is released on 26 June on digital platforms.","201":"This low-key, low-budget portrait of an odd-couple friendship takes a while to get going, and never fully hits its stride \u2013 though it has its moments. Director Hugo Andre\u0301 plays chef turned food blogger Sacha, a fastidious Frenchman living in London who rents a room in a house. His new landlord and flatmate is city banker Dan (Will Masheter), who seems to slot neatly into the stereotype of macho finance bro. But Dan turns out to have a secret life, dressing up in glittery glam frocks and feather boas, transforming into alter ego Danielle.A friendship of sorts develops between the two men, throwing up a couple of nice scenes. When Dan cooks soup, picky gourmand Sacha looks appalled in the way that only a Frenchman can at the claggy dollop of peanut butter slopped into his bowl. There\u2019s a real sweetness, too, in Masheter\u2019s performance as Dan begins to live more openly, tiptoeing into the world of cabaret \u2013 and, if nothing else, watching his self-expression blossom is a reminder of how sinister the anti-drag laws are that are currently sweeping the US.Elsewhere, some of the acting feels a bit broad and the film has some clumsy moments. The movie deals unconvincingly with a disciplinary procedure at Dan\u2019s banking firm, where his line manager takes action that I\u2019m certain no city boss would dare to, fearing an expensive lawsuit or bad publicity. Like a lot here, it feels distractingly a bit off and not quite real \u2013 or maybe just not thought through properly. Makeup is released on 26 June on digital platforms.","202":"Here is a perfectly decent, personable family entertainment from Pixar, based around another of this studio\u2019s oddly pedantic and algorithmically developed abstract high concepts: what if fire and water fell in love? It is also a star-crossed love story based on that most traditional of American themes: melting-pot diversity in the big city.The scene is another fabular alt-reality: Element City, a place of vivid colours and shapes like a toy held up in front of a newborn. Here, the creatures of the four elements \u2013 fire, water, earth and air \u2013 have come together to live, if not in harmony exactly, then a kind of boisterous acceptance. There is, however, a bigoted caste system that means that fire creatures are looked down on, maybe in the way the US\u2019s northern European identities look down on people from hotter countries.Each of them comes from an old country where they were members of the only element-ethnicity. Bernie and Cindy Lumen (voiced by Ronnie Del Carmen and Shila Ommi) are hardworking first-generation fire immigrants who set up a store in the city\u2019s Fire Town district. They have a smart, fiery-tempered teen daughter Ember (Leah Lewis), whom they hope will take over the business when they are gone.But left alone to mind the shop one day, Ember\u2019s explosively combustible temper cracks the pipes, which have been amateurishly installed by her dad, and this brings a certain watery young man through the cracks. This is Wade Ripple (Mamoudou Athie), a government building inspector who really ought to penalise the Lumen family. But he\u2019s a goofy, soppy romantic whose watery identity is represented chiefly by his tear ducts. There\u2019s a funny scene showing his family playing what they call \u201cthe crying game\u201d (nothing to do with Neil Jordan\u2019s film of that name), in which they challenge each other to listen to a poignant story without bursting into tears.Wade falls in love with Ember, whose incendiary talent for turning sand into glass might yet prove to be the making of them both. To find happiness, Wade has to prove himself to Ember and also to her suspicious parents.It\u2019s a bit silly, a bit surreal, a bit simplistic, and lands itself with the problem of how to show Ember being sad (which she sometimes is) and Wade being passionate (which he also sometimes is). But this film is surely pitched at much younger kids than a comparable Pixar film such as Inside Out, in which the separate moods inside us all were represented by different characters.The question of whether Pixar\u2019s golden age is irrevocably behind us is now well-established and perhaps also misleading. In fact, Pixar has given us some outstanding films recently in Soul and Coco, and I am admittedly in a minority in thinking the Toy Story spin-off Lightyear is much better than it\u2019s given credit for. But undoubtedly Elemental is another step away from the sophisticated brilliance of this studio\u2019s glory days.Perhaps these multicoloured abstracts make the films sell better in international territories, but there is a worrying hint of PixarGPT about all this. Elemental seems to have been formulated with slightly chilling accuracy and the look of the movie is less interesting than it could have been. But having said that, a certain sweet, unworldly idealism in Elemental survives, the keynote of optimism \u2013 and this is the flame that Pixar has to keep alive. Elemental is out now in Australia and the US, and on 7 July in the UK","203":"Nearly 50 years ago, a young artist called John Smith took his camera to a street in Dalston, London, to film people going about their lives. Except that he pretended to construct and author this raw slice of reality. Over the black and white footage you hear Smith barking out commands like a director. \u201cI want the man in the white boiler suit to come in from the left!\u201d It\u2019s funny and thought-provoking: what is is art, if not a moment in which we frame all the stuff going on in the world, and see it as if we were part of a vast fiction?Smith\u2019s work forms part of the first exhibition at the Whitechapel Gallery in London under its new director, Gilane Tawadros. It\u2019s a promisingly quirky, adventurous start by her, that challenges you to wonder what the difference between art and life is, if any. This is not exactly a new question. But it is asked here in a daring way that risks utter banality to unlock poetry.Smith\u2019s 1976 conceptual art masterpiece The Girl Chewing Gum is its keynote, a British punk version of French New Wave cinema that suggests art is life, and life only. The parody directorial voice becomes increasingly deranged: a young man walking by in a rain coat has just robbed a bank and has a gun in his pocket. Then the kids in the cinema queue notice the camera and start looking at it, curious, amused and self-conscious. A moment of truth that transcends invention. It\u2019s lovely.Much in the exhibition turns a direct mirror to the streets outside, in almost unmediated images of British urban life right now. Playing a similar game to Smith, Mitra Tabrizian\u2019s Film Stills invite you to find a narrative in apparently chaotic, random photos of lockups and parked cars. Yet the depth of this show lies in seeing inwards, understanding that as we pass by each other, our memories and desires brush the air like ghostly shadows. Alia Syed crosses that border between outer existence and inner consciousness in her film Fatima\u2019s Letter: against fleeting monochrome images of platforms and trains, we hear fragmented memories of migration and lost worlds, lost connections.That same sense of the infinite mystery hidden in the daily grind is given transcendent form by the classic of contemporary art that concludes this exhibition. Mark Wallinger\u2019s Threshold to the Kingdom may be familiar to some but seeing it again makes you startled at how such a simple idea can be so profound. Wallinger fixes his camera on people coming out of the arrivals gate at an airport. Their smiles and the hugs of waiting friends, or their anxious, isolated faces, or confident strides, are shown in slow motion, lifesize, approaching you directly. Allegri\u2019s Miserere plays majestically. And it is like seeing people enter heaven, a scene from a Last Judgment altarpiece, a canto written by Dante: so much poetry, taken from completely real, ordinary moments in modern lives. It makes the exhibition\u2019s point perfectly: art is just looking, in a certain way, at life.There are good works aplenty, but the discovery here is the radical veteran John Smith. In 2020 Smith started filming over the rooftops from his window in the London borough of Hackney. There\u2019s so much mist and snow in the opening shot that you can only see a white blankness above the houses. When that clears, the glass towers of the City loom and we hear Boris Johnson in the early weeks of 2020 talking dismissively about coronavirus. As the days pass his pronouncements get more alarmed. Smith carries on filming, spying on his neighbours as they move around their homes in lockdown. While Downing Street partied.It\u2019s almost too real. Often, art is an escape \u2013 or at least a way of sublimating the mess of life, like Smith pretending to \u201cdirect\u201d it in his early film. This exhibition wonders what it would be like if art was as true, as unvarnished, as a piece of chewing gum on asphalt. Refreshing, is the answer.Life Is More Important Than Art is at the Whitechapel Gallery, London, until 17 September","204":"There is an august tradition in the African American community of talking back to the film screen loud enough to jolt the characters on screen. The Blackening doesn\u2019t just hear those cries; it needles its crowd for more reactions, bigger this time.From Tim Story, the director of Fantastic Four and Ride Along, the film starts with a group of college friends reuniting at a creaky woodland cabin \u2013 replete with drinks, drugs and marathon games of Spades. Premiering at last year\u2019s Toronto film festival, Story\u2019s feature releases this weekend pegged to Juneteenth \u2013 the emancipation holiday marking its second year in federal observance.Just when the love triangle between strait-laced Lisa (Dear White People\u2019s Antoinette Robinson), fuckboy Nnamdi (House Party\u2019s Sinqua Walls) and gay bestie Dewayne (the Emmy nominee Dewayne Perkins, who produced and co-wrote the film with Girls Trip\u2019s Tracy Oliver) threatens to kill the vibe, half of the couple hosting the gala turns up dead (SNL\u2019s Jay Pharoah); the fate of the other mate (Insecure\u2019s Yvonne Orji) still hangs in the balance.The only way the friends can save her is by playing the Blackening, like Life meets Saw but with the most racist Monopoly man you\u2019ve ever seen \u2013 a talking sambo doll face. Trivia categories run the gamut from basic TV (How many seasons did \u201cDark Aunt Viv\u201d get on the Fresh Prince?) to advanced hip-hop math (How many blunts are there on Nas\u2019s One Mic?) When the contest turns on a trick question the friends become fair game for the slaughter.The film\u2019s fighting spirit is born from a recognizable brand of consciousness. Which is to say there is never a time when these Black people aren\u2019t fully aware that they are in exactly the kind of situation that other Black people will scold them for getting into. Getting out of it means getting the small details right \u2013 down to turning a friend\u2019s pistol grip from sideways to upright so the bullets actually hit the big bad. Having all Black characters just complicates the age-old genre problem of whom to kill off first, an idea Perkins first wrestled with in a 2018 sketch. Even Officer White (The Drew Carey Show\u2019s Diedrich Bader) is hip to his particular dubiousness.The friends still make plenty of mortal mistakes \u2013 splitting up, going to a second location and turning on one another even as the audience urges them otherwise. But the blunders are easily excused because the characters making them are smartly drawn. King (House Party\u2019s Melvin Gregg) is the thug turned peacemaker \u201cballs deep in the sunken place\u201d (his partner is white, you see) who nonetheless came on this trip packing heat. Allison (Empire\u2019s Grace Byers) is the biracial militant whose beef with The Man traces to the suspicions she harbors toward her actual white father. Shanika (The Farewell\u2019s X Mayo) oscillates from turn-up queen to voice of reason and back again.But the clear standout in this group is Clifton, the bespectacled two-time Trump voter some will strain to recognize as Jermaine Fowler \u2013 Coming 2 America\u2019s heir aberrant. The time working with Eddie Murphy rubbed off on this character, a chip off the ol\u2019 Jiff Ramsey. He stands in for the sheepish minority who have no idea how to play Spades, and no hope of learning from peers who treat the game as a cultural heirloom passed down only to the truly Black. Clifton\u2019s response to that rejection is a strike for those at the cookout (ahem) who still don\u2019t know how to play Spades \u2013 less a game of chance than of ESP, as The Blackening rightly makes clear. Never mind that most of us would be happy to exact revenge over a table of dominoes, still one of the easiest and most accessible games in the world.As a horror The Blackening isn\u2019t the scariest. But that\u2019s not the point of this film \u2013 a Fubu satire smack in the sweet spot between Get Out and Scary Movie. Explicitly comic while stopping just short of slapstick, it\u2019s a film best seen in a theater with a Black audience that will sing along with Allison as she struggles through the second verse of Lift Every Voice (AKA the Black national anthem). The filmgoers at my Atlanta screening were never howling more than when Dewayne randomly dropped into the jingle for O\u2019Reilly Auto Parts, the most surprising entry on the universal Black factboard by far.Where Michael Jackson\u2019s Thriller and the Fugees\u2019 Killing Me Softly With His Song winked at the very audience embracing them, The Blackening throws its arms around its crowd and squeezes hard. If you\u2019re feeling at all frightened, it\u2019s because you\u2019re just not feeling the love.The Blackening is out in US cinemas on 16 June and in the UK on 25 August.","205":"There are lots of literal grey areas in the Australian film-maker Amiel Courtin-Wilson\u2019s very compelling and heart-rending documentary about the final week of Bob Rosenzweig, a 65-year-old Jewish man living in Washington who has Parkinson\u2019s disease and decides to end his life through assisted dying. From the opening shot Courtin-Wilson draws a stony overcast aesthetic, beginning with an ambiguous image of what seems to resemble a foggy, ashen skyline before a vague human outline emerges. Later there are shots of misty skylines and bodies of water more cement-coloured than blue; it\u2019s as if the world around Rosenzweig is greying before his eyes, easing him through his last days.Courtin-Wilson and the cinematographer, Jac Fitzgerald, impressively texture the film in ways that make it feel stylish \u2013 but not so stylish as to detract from its impact. Man on Earth is an observational documentary that prioritises, above everything else, the subject and his circumstances. It\u2019s pitched at just the right level of immersion: a soft, spectral glow veneering more conventional fly-on-the-wall elements such as handheld camerawork. The director has said in an interview that inspirations for the film\u2019s palette include The Magpie by Monet, who was once described by John Berger in ways that perhaps also apply to Courtin-Wilson: an artist who \u201cwanted to paint not things in themselves but the air that touched things\u201d.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningWhat can\u2019t be observed in Man on Earth in direct visual terms is the relationship between the director and his subject. The former bore a huge responsibility to the latter to tell his story responsibly and powerfully. And the latter was wise to entrust him: presumably Rosenzweig watched Courtin-Wilson\u2019s other films, several of which are also built on striking collaborations with intriguing people from various walks of life. For instance the Australian-born Tibetan Buddhist nun Robina Courtin, who was the subject of 2000\u2019s Chasing Buddha; the great Indigenous entertainer Jack Charles, who was the subject of 2008\u2019s Bastardy; and Daniel P Jones, an ex-convict who plays a fictionalised version of himself in the strikingly gritty, yet intensely poetic, 2011 drama Hail.Courtin-Wilson introduces us to Rosenzweig in an odd way, showing him mid-sentence or mid-statement, saying: \u201cAnd that\u2019s what my new philosophy in life is \u2013 ah, fuck it.\u201d There\u2019s a feeling we might have arrived a smidge too late to fully appreciate what he\u2019s saying. Which might be true in a broader sense too, in that it\u2019s obvious the best days for this sharp and quick-witted individual, worn down by time and sickness, are far behind him. Rosenzweig \u2013 who designed bathrooms for the likes of Elton John and Janet Jackson, and hung out with celebrities including the Sex Pistols and Blondie \u2013 has been given six months to live.Sign up to Saved for LaterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsafter newsletter promotionThe rakishly thin Rosenzweig reflects on the intense chronic pain he experiences, and how \u201cyou really don\u2019t have any concept of time when you have Parkinson\u2019s\u201d because \u201cthere\u2019s no need to know what day it is\u201d. One of his sons, Jessie, who is his carer, also comments on his condition, observing for instance how Parkinson\u2019s \u201cconstantly forces your body to move\u201d and thus constantly makes it burn energy. \u201cImagine swimming a hundred laps every hour,\u201d he says. Rosenzweig is resolute that it is \u201cabsolutely the right time\u201d to say goodbye, and he\u2019s \u201cready to go\u201d.Assisted dying allows the subject to make preparations and bid farewell to loved ones: a task Rosenzweig undertakes with bravery, introspection and a wee bit of cheeky humour. The cameras are there until the very end: in his home, perched by his deathbed. The film\u2019s last 40 or so minutes in particular are \u2013 in a melancholic way \u2013 beautifully humane, but gosh it\u2019s heartbreaking: tears were rolling down my face and I have no doubt many viewers will respond similarly. We all arrive at the same destination as Rosenzweig in the end, but not all of us shuffle off the mortal coil exhibiting such strength of character. Films like Man on Earth are tough to watch but we emerge from them deeper and richer.Man on Earth is screening as part of Sydney film festival. It will be released in cinemas from October, with worldwide community screenings available now; to register for or organise an advance screening go to floodprojects.com\/man-on-earth","206":"A jukebox musical featuring the works of Take That might not ever be one for the cool kids; undoubtedly this is a bit broad, but it\u2019s a splurge of feelgood from director Coky Giedroyc and screenwriter Tim Firth, adapting his own stage show, and it\u2019s at least as enjoyable as the much-hyped Mamma Mia! movies.Aisling Bea gives it loads as Rachel, a hardworking NHS nurse who in her teen years was a massive Take That stan (as no one used to say in 1993) along with her four best mates from school. She is astonished one day to be phoned up by the local radio station and told she\u2019s won a luxury all-inclusive deal for her and some guests to fly to Athens and see Take That on a reunion tour. This brings Rachel to a state of orgasmic excitement combined with a nervous breakdown as she realises she must round up the now middle-aged women she hasn\u2019t seen for 25 years and they\u2019ll all have to measure the joys and bittersweet disappointments of their lives against a Take That soundtrack. And she has to confront a painful memory connected to the last time they saw the band live in Manchester.There are laughs here: young Rachel turns on the TV in the 90s to see something on Ceefax about Britain\u2019s bright future in the EU, the girls talk about how Take That\u2019s \u201cbeach\u201d video for Pray looks weirdly like a version of Lord of the Flies, and they bunk off school to see their mate take part in a high-diving competition holding up a massive inspirational banner in the spectators\u2019 gallery, reading: \u201cDON\u2019T F*CK IT UP\u201d. And we get a witty jump cut from the shot of Rachel\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s beaming face when he thinks that her \u201cbig news\u201d is that she wants to get married, to his later face, realising this is about a Take That reunion concert, to which he is not in fact invited. Greatest Days screens in a one-night premiere on 15 June in UK and Irish cinemas, and goes on general release on 16 June.","207":"Juliette Binoche is incapable of giving a bad performance, but here she is, probably as close as she\u2019ll ever get to a stinker, playing a long-distance lorry driver on the wrong side of the law in Mississippi. For about five minutes there\u2019s novelty watching La Binoche in trucker mode, wearing a bandana and filthy jeans, stomping around yelling \u201cmotherfucker\u201d at anyone who messes with her. But, her acting, like everything else in this sluggish crime drama written and directed by Norwegian film-maker Anna Gutto, feels implausible; more like tourism than anything in the real world.Binoche plays Sally, a French Canadian we meet on the highway, shooting the breeze over the radio with her friends on the female trucker scene. A film about this community of ballsy women in the male world of trucking, dealing with the seedy truck stops and misogyny, might have gone the distance. Instead the movie shifts to Sally and her brother Dennis (Frank Grillo), who is about to be released from prison.It turns out that Sally is being blackmailed by a crime gang, forced to smuggle drugs in her lorry, or Dennis gets it. Her latest package is human \u2013 a 12-year-old girl called Leila (Hala Finley) \u2013 and the delivery is across the state lines into the hands of a paedophile ring. When things go seriously wrong at the drop-off Sally and Leila hit the road.Fair play to the script, which delays the inevitable bonding between Sally and Leila until later on. Sally is no bleeding heart; her first thought is to return the girl to the gang. Enter retired FBI agent Gerick (Morgan Freeman), now working as a consultant for the Bureau. He forms a ridiculously cliched double act with Yale-educated suit-and-tie-wearing desk agent Sterling (Cameron Monaghan). The script does almost nothing to build up to the revelation at the end \u2013 and the human trafficking angle feels icky. You might want to give it a swerve, Binoche or not. Paradise Highway is available from 17 June on Sky Cinema, and is streaming on Netflix in Australia.","208":"Motherhood is mayhem. Just ask any woebegone mama of film history: Mia Farrow\u2019s wide-eyed Rosemary Woodhouse, beset with paranoia; Margaret White, the religious zealot of Carrie who mistakes punishment for protection; the bloodthirsty Pamela Voorhees; the abusive Norma Bates.Nowhere, though, is home to more mummy issues than Australia, a country that has hosted some of recent cinema\u2019s stickiest forays into miserable mothers. See: The Babadook\u2019s young widow defending her precocious son against a spindly storybook beast. Or 2020\u2019s Relic, where three generations of women confront their relationships with one another while also confronting some sort of annoying demon disrupting their family reunion.

The cliches fly thick and fast: a squall of wind in the distance, a barren landscape striated by naked branches, ghoulish dreams awash with eldritch images. And that\u2019s just the first five minutes. Before long, we meet that most crucial of tropes: a mother, Sarah (Sarah Snook), and her creepy daughter Mia (Lily LaTorre).It\u2019s Mia\u2019s seventh birthday, but everything feels grim. Mia\u2019s grandfather has recently died, and mother and daughter are still riding the aftershocks of his death. The sky is pallid, and the house \u2013 a chilly place somewhere in the city \u2013 easily dwarfs its two inhabitants. Sarah trudges through melancholia to put on a birthday celebration: a quiet affair with her ex-husband, Pete (Damon Herriman), and his new partner, Denise (Naomi Rukavina).A white bunny has somehow entered the house, to Mia\u2019s delight and Sarah\u2019s consternation. It takes to hiding under tables and in eerie corridors: an unwelcome guest whose presence is less adorable than alarming. We return to the rabbit throughout the night, sometimes in spine-tingling closeup, its eyes gleaming devilishly in the blue-dark. Not since Monty Python has a rabbit looked so bloodthirsty; it\u2019s no wonder Sarah tries \u2013 and fails \u2013 to exile the feral creature when she thinks no one\u2019s watching. \u201cPiss off,\u201d she chides the bunny, who promptly bites her.The bunny becomes one of Run Rabbit Run\u2019s most tantalising elements. Its arrival might be a Lewis Carroll reference, especially given the name of Sarah\u2019s sister \u2013 Alice \u2013 who went missing as a child. But the film quickly does away with the bunny\u2019s mystery (supernatural, or merely strange?) to focus on Mia\u2019s increasingly hostile demeanour. Something\u2019s been off-kilter since her birthday: she\u2019s suddenly demanding to visit Joan (Greta Scacchi), Sarah\u2019s long-estranged mother whom Mia has never met. Before long, Mia is insisting that she is Alice reincarnate.These are certainly intriguing threads, but they can\u2019t help but feel recycled. Mia\u2019s uncanny, sinister quirks are pulled straight from The Babadook; Sarah\u2019s strained relationship with her ailing mother hews a little too close to Relic, with which this film shares two producers. Snook, of course, is typically excellent, fresh from her turn as Succession\u2019s petulant, scheming Shiv Roy in another spiky role here \u2013 but even her performance, as it heightens towards a crazed delirium, recalls Toni Collette\u2019s in Hereditary.Sign up to Saved for LaterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsafter newsletter promotionRun Rabbit Run pulls from each of these entries without ever quite congealing into its own work. At its worst, it replicates the most overplayed tendencies of so-called elevated horror, the subset of the genre which rejects outright thrills and chills in favour of a more subdued, and often duller, gloominess. Screenwriter Hannah Kent \u2013 better known for her novels \u2013 has a knack for morbid, moody portraits of women in isolated communities, but Run Rabbit Run leans on its atmosphere as a crutch, turning to an abstraction that feels increasingly limp. Something here is weird, we\u2019re told for the fourth, fifth, sixth time.Against all reasonable logic, Sarah returns to her late father\u2019s country house with Mia in tow, where the film continuously hints at a darker current of dread eddying just beneath the surface: patches of blood that mysteriously appear on Mia\u2019s forehead, or a back yard shed full of sharp tools. But these hints never erupt into something greater, and it begins to grow tiresome. Taken together, they play less like a film and more like a moodboard of scares. Motherhood, for all its mayhem, looks a little mundane.Run Rabbit Run is being shown as part of Sydney film festival, on 10 and 15 June. It will premiere on Netflix worldwide on 28 June","209":"It\u2019s the early 1990s. A new subspecies of Transformer \u2013 the part-animal, part-robot Maximals \u2013 joins forces with Optimus Prime and his Autobots to fight against a ruthless foe, the Terrorcons, who are in the service of Unicron, a planet-munching monster deity. We know all this because every 10 minutes or so, the imbecilic bombast of Transformers: Rise of the Beasts grinds to a halt so that one or more of the characters can explain the story to us.You could argue that any film that requires this much leaden exposition to nail down its plot points really shouldn\u2019t be trusted with heavy machinery. But then, smashing stuff up was always the point of the metal-for-brains Transformers series, the dumbest and noisiest of all the billion-dollar movie franchises. And the latest instalment certainly delivers on needless destruction and world-class stupidity. Plus points include a punchy soundtrack of 90s hip-hop, and Anthony Ramos and Dominique Fishback, heroically holding their own as the hapless humans roped into the Transformers\u2019 thunderous mess.","210":"A film telling the story of a Mexican American janitor who went on to create a $1bn snack brand fits into Hollywood\u2019s current cultural and creative moment rather perfectly. It\u2019s been a time both of exploring the dramatic origins of everyday products and services (from Nike\u2019s Air Jordans to BlackBerry to Tetris to Uber) and of finding more ways to tell diverse stories outside of a prohibitively limited lens, a lens that\u2019s been particularly limited for Latino characters.Despite Latino audiences over-indexing at cinemas in the US (in 2021, they had the highest per-capita attendance, averaging 1.7 visits a year compared with 1.3 for white audiences), there remains a disappointing dearth of big-screen representation (a report last year showed that just 5.2% of leads in film were Latino or Hispanic). Ahead of this summer\u2019s landmark DC adventure Blue Beetle, centering a rare Latino superhero, Eva Longoria has found an unlikely success story to propel her to the title of film-maker, having cut her teeth on television. Her small-screen tutelage is hard to shake in this earnest and at times efficiently entertaining, yet also rather plodding rags-to-riches tale that aside from the odd flourish, feels very much like a TV movie.It\u2019s hard not to get at least mildly involved though in the story of Richard Monta\u00f1ez, as he grows up as a kid balancing his Mexican-American identity in 60s California while being targeted at school and physically abused at home. Longoria, and the screenwriters Linda Yvette Ch\u00e1vez and Lewis Colick, keep things light even as Monta\u00f1ez (now played by Jesse Garcia) falls into a life of crime with his partner Judy (Annie Gonzalez) by his side. The arrival of a baby forces them to reconsider but an unwelcoming job market, one especially unwelcoming for someone who looks like Richard, makes life a constant struggle. When he gets a job as a janitor at the local Frito-Lay factory, he takes the opportunity with all the enthusiasm he can muster, smiling through various indignities and grateful to be providing for his family.Mopping floors and cleaning equipment isn\u2019t quite enough, though, and when business starts to crumble with a recession-impacted market and a string of layoffs, Richard comes up with an idea, a way to cater to the underserved Latino market, to make the Cheeto \u2026 Flamin\u2019 Hot.There\u2019s some obvious mirroring here, the adaptation of a story of someone striving to appeal to a growing yet underappreciated demographic attempting to do the exact same thing, and while the recent trend of business origin stories has been hit and miss to say the least, it\u2019s at least refreshing to see someone who isn\u2019t a straight white man progress within industry (2020\u2019s Madam CJ Walker series Self Made felt similarly vital, if ultimately superior). The film neatly recognises the importance of food as cultural identity and the authenticity that should come with parlaying this into a just business proposition \u2013 but while there\u2019s an easy underdog tale here to cheer on, it\u2019s not quite as compelling as the makers seem to believe. Similar to Ben Affleck\u2019s Air (a film that would have worked far better had Viola Davis\u2019s force-of-nature mother been the lead), it all feels a little too minor, a Wikipedia page writ medium.Because even the most magnetic moments (a montage of Monta\u00f1ez and family crafting the perfect chilli sauce, a late-stage grassroots marketing campaign) become dubious with even the lightest bit of research. These films, when done even half-correct, compel one to dig further into the facts, to learn more about the reality of the situation and it doesn\u2019t take long to discover that Flamin\u2019 Hot became the centre of controversy as soon as it was announced. The Los Angeles Times ran an investigation that found that Monta\u00f1ez\u2019s involvement with the creation of the Flamin\u2019 Hot Cheeto has not just been overstated but has been fully fabricated. Since then, a he said, they said back-and-forth has left the situation even foggier (the script was slightly tweaked to recognise the work of a separate team working on a similar project with one of the writers saying \u201cenough\u201d was true for it to work and it shouldn\u2019t be seen as a documentary) and so the facts remain a mystery.One accepts a certain amount of creative license with \u201ctrue stories\u201d and Monta\u00f1ez\u2019s rise from the bottom to the top is undeniable regardless of his level of involvement with the snack in question, but taken as fact or fiction, the film just isn\u2019t enough of a meal. It\u2019s cheerily done and competently made but broadly sentimental to a fault, the strings being pulled too visible for the film\u2019s many coerced moments of emotion to really work. For a film all about the importance of heat, it\u2019s frankly lukewarm.Flamin\u2019 Hot is now available on Hulu in the US and Disney+ elsewhere","211":"This slight, scrappy documentary follows an all-female crew of downhill skateboarders on a road trip to northern Turkey. To the risk-averse, their sport looks suicidally dangerous, like snowboarding on concrete: riders on longboards cutting down steep roads at speeds up to 140kph, leaving cars for dust. The risk of mangled limbs becomes clear five minutes into the film when skater Jennifer Schauerte hits a patch of gravel, comes off her board and slams into a road barrier. The X-ray of the snapped bone in her leg is the most horrific thing I\u2019ve seen in a cinema so far this year.Three operations later, Schauerte is impatient \u2013 maybe even reckless \u2013 in her determination to get back on her board. She\u2019s planning a trip to the mountains of north Turkey in her camper with four friends from the skating scene. Together they are the WoolfWomen. (Disappointingly, they are not named in honour of Virginia \u00ad\u2013 the extra \u201co\u201d seems to be a typo that stuck.) It is by no means an essential skateboarding documentary; we don\u2019t learn much about the sport, its history or this group\u2019s place in skateboard culture. Instead, it\u2019s more about chronicling a tribe: cool women travelling wild and free, skinny-dipping in Bulgaria, sitting around the campfire. Schauerte is the star and co-directs with Marchella De Angelis.There are glimpses of a more interesting film at points. Schauerte is clearly a big personality, with charisma and possibly the ego to match. When it\u2019s time to skate in Turkey, the rest of her pack are not convinced she\u2019s recovered sufficiently. \u201cYou don\u2019t care about your body, but we do,\u201d says one, exasperatedly. A sharper, more detached film might have focused more on this. In all honesty, much of Woolf Women feels like watching a fly-on-the-wall of someone\u2019s else\u2019s holiday. WoolfWomen: Now or Never is released on 8 June in UK cinemas.","212":"Legal transcripts have long provided rich source material for authentically gripping movies. Last year, the Tribeca festival showcased The Courtroom, a well-received deportation drama featuring \u201cdialogue taken directly from court transcripts\u201d. But it\u2019s not just courtrooms that provide such inspiration. Think back to the \u201cverbatim theatre\u201d of Clio Barnard\u2019s 2010 feature debut The Arbor, in which actors lip-synced recorded interviews about the troubled life of the playwright Andrea Dunbar. In the 2013 TV show Nixon\u2019s the One, Harry Shearer reimagined Tricky Dicky\u2019s secret audio tapes as video recordings, creating an absurdist black comedy from word-for-word Oval Office transcripts. More recently, James Spinney and Peter Middleton\u2019s documentary The Real Charlie Chaplin (2021) added dramatised visuals to archived audio to bring the controversial cinema pioneer\u2019s legend to life.In 2019, playwright Tina Satter used the FBI transcript of an interview with NSA-contracted translator and US Air Force veteran Reality Leigh Winner as the basis of her verbatim play Is This a Room. On 3 June 2017, Winner had been accosted by two FBI agents, Justin C Garrick and R Wallace Taylor, outside her home in Augusta, Georgia. The agents, who recorded the encounter, told Winner they had a warrant to search her home arising from \u201cthe possible mishandling of classified information\u201d \u2013 a violation of the 1917 Espionage Act. That same act would later be cited in an August 2022 warrant for Mar-a-Lago, the Florida residence of the former president for whom Russian military intelligence (according to a report leaked by Winner) had attempted to secure election victory in 2016. Yet while Teflon Don\u2019s own classified documents scandal is still ongoing, it\u2019s inconceivable that Trump will face anything like the harsh sanctions handed down to Winner in 2018.Satter\u2019s feature film debut, which she has adapted for the screen with co-writer James Paul Dallas, opens with the declaration that \u201cthe dialogue in this movie is taken entirely from the transcript of that [FBI] recording\u201d. Sydney Sweeney, who excelled as the stroppy, manipulative Olivia Mossbacher in the first series of HBO\u2019s black comedy White Lotus, is in altogether more vulnerable mode as Winner, who returns home to find Garrick (Josh Hamilton) and Taylor (March\u00e1nt Davis) in her driveway. The agents\u2019 manner is passive-aggressive, all fixed smiles and quietly threatening body language. They stress repeatedly that Winner\u2019s cooperation is \u201ccompletely voluntary\u201d while also making it clear that she has little agency in the unfolding drama.As for Winner, whose demeanour is a strange blend of amiable and unsettled, her primary concern is her pets: the cat who has hidden under the bed but may run out though an open door on to the road; the dog who will need to be penned before the agents can search the house. When Garrick quietly tells his partner that \u201cshe doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on\u201d, it\u2019s unclear whether he\u2019s talking about the dog or their suspect.There\u2019s a palm-sweating tension between the veneer of geniality (small talk about rescue animals chewing furniture and groceries going into the refrigerator) and the escalation of the search procedure, ramped up by flash-frame images of the actual raid and surreal Twin Peaks-style visual ellipses during redacted portions of the transcript. When Winner, whose interstitial social media posts paint an unremarkable background picture, admits that the only private place in the house is a \u201cweird\u201d and \u201ccreepy\u201d room behind the kitchen (she\u2019s embarrassed because it\u2019s dirty and unused), her descriptive terms seem entirely in keeping with the tenor of their conversation, as if the film was balancing precariously on the cusp of quotidian procedural, black comedy and shrieking horror.Nathan Micay, series composer for BBC\/HBO\u2019s Industry, provides a pulsing score that lends a throb of impending disaster to even the most innocuous exchanges, fluttering between Brian Eno-esque ambience and the skin-crawling atonalities of Mica Levi\u2019s sci-fi soundtrack for Under the Skin. At times, the air of awkwardness becomes almost unbearable, the artifice of the dramatic conceit (Pinteresque pauses, coughs and stutters; cinematographer Paul Yee\u2019s unforgiving strip-lit interiors) highlighting the gap between civility and catastrophe, climaxing in Winner\u2019s almost oddly matter-of-fact question: \u201cAm I going to jail tonight?\u201dBookended by the vile blather of Fox News, in response to which Winner was pushed to act, Reality is a stranger-than-fiction reminder of the precarious times in which we live, and of what happens when individuals challenge authorities less troubled by truth than retribution.","213":"Is it possible to equal a film as boundlessly inventive, stylistically bold and effortlessly cool as Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse? Could a sequel ever match that film\u2019s freshness, energy and visual verve? The answer, it seems, is an emphatic yes. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is sublime. There\u2019s not a frame of this rich, kaleidoscopically detailed animation that isn\u2019t dazzling. It takes the basic themes of the first film \u2013 adolescent isolation, communication breakdown, the messy, stressful business of growing, of finding your people \u2013 and builds whole worlds with them. It\u2019s a dizzying onslaught of ideas and graphic references. It has heart. It even has a font gag.In the film-making team and in the story there\u2019s a pleasing combination of original talent and fresh blood. Phil Lord and Christopher Miller return as writers and producers, but there\u2019s a new directing team that includes Kemp Powers (Pixar\u2019s Soul). Once again, the story focuses on the bond between fellow Spider-people Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) and Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld). But there is a host of new characters, each with their own distinctive look, including Hobie (Daniel Kaluuya), a spider-punk anarchist, drawn with a graphic style that borrows from Jamie Reid\u2019s Sex Pistols aesthetic and Jamie Hewlett\u2019s Gorillaz.It\u2019s densely plotted, almost overwhelming at times; Daniel Pemberton\u2019s score is an Escher staircase of anxiety. But the soul of the film lies in the tiny human details: like the way Miles, about to gain access to an inner Spider-circle, bounces lightly on his toes \u2013 still, at heart, an excited kid waiting for a treat.","214":"There is little to no nature in German artist and film-maker Julian Rosefeldt\u2019s newest work, Euphoria, although there are plenty of animals. Sheep, white stallions, a moose, a camel and finally, voiced seductively by Cate Blanchett, a massive tiger stalking the aisles of an abandoned supermarket. Are they talismans or mute witnesses; mocking us or looking on with horror as we destroy the world?Unlike Godfrey Reggio\u2019s experimental documentary film Koyaanisqatsi, which pitted humanity\u2019s ever increasing growth against the monumental power of nature, Rosefeldt depicts a world already unhinged from the natural, already in its death spiral to oblivion. And where Reggio allowed his images \u2013 tied unforgettably to Philip Glass\u2019s pixellated tonal soundscapes \u2013 to do the work, Rosefeldt leans heavily, often exhaustingly, on the spoken word.Characters proselytise and lecture, pontificate and philosophise, berate, cajole, expostulate and theorise, all on the subject of money \u2013 humankind\u2019s avaricious need for it, its dehumanising effect on communities, the corrupting viral tendency of our financial systems to swallow the world.Cobbled from various sources, from Shakespeare to Warren Buffett, Ayn Rand to Snoop Dogg, the script has the epigrammatic feel of a book of quotes, aphorisms for getting through the death of capitalism. At its best, as with a group of young adults grappling with potentiality and the future of work, it can be bracing and inspired. At its worst, it can be banal and reductive.Sign up to Saved for LaterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsafter newsletter promotionThe piece is at least physically impressive, with a giant screen at one end of the Melbourne town hall where most of the action takes place, and five smaller screens depicting solo drummers at their kits, providing Euphoria\u2019s driving, pulsating beat. Beneath these screens runs the work\u2019s Greek chorus, a choir of young people (the Brooklyn Youth Chorus) lined up like a living skirting board, facing us with hope and sometimes what feels suspiciously like derision. Aurally, it\u2019s magnificent.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningVisually, it\u2019s often beautiful too, without ever quite reaching the heights of euphoria promised by that title. Christoph Krauss\u2019s cinematography is captivating, the intense clarity of the image never at the sacrifice of texture and tone. There are neat little nods to cinematic visionaries from Fellini to Busby Berkeley, and tracking shots for days \u2013 although drones have quickly diminished the technical prestige of those admittedly majestic aerial shots. Rosefeldt seems to make a joke of this at one point, as a woman gathers drones around her like birds.There\u2019s a jokiness to much of Euphoria, most notably in a sequence inside a bank where tellers and customers alike wax lyrical on the power of money, its seductiveness and sensuality \u2013 before launching themselves into aerial acrobatics and full-blown Broadway choreography. But cutesy dance routines and winking cultural references don\u2019t just undercut the work\u2019s serious intent, something Rosefeldt clearly wants; they also undermine his central argument, something he presumably doesn\u2019t.Euphoria is grappling with a key tension in modern western democracies: how can we stop desiring the thing that will bring about our own destruction, namely endless economic growth in an increasingly automated world? One character, working in a factory that deliberately evokes Amazon, calls for rebellion, and the homeless men who gather around a bin seem to be sniffing at the edges of actual revolution. But Rosefeldt constantly reverts to evasive surrealist flourishes, or painfully obvious visual metaphors, just as his work threatens to become truly angry, truly about something.Elements of the work suggest a quasi-religious, ritualistic purpose \u2013 and whenever the music is allowed to swell, we get tantalising hints of it \u2013 but Euphoria never quite succumbs to its own impulses. Rosefeldt is influenced by the ancient Greeks, but maybe he should have taken a closer look at Ovid and his retelling of the myth of Phaeton.The son of Helios (the actual sun), Phaeton steals his dad\u2019s chariot and crashes it, obliterating the Earth in the process. Ovid\u2019s account is rapturous with destruction\u2019s power and beauty, an ecstasy in Armageddon Shakespeare would also channel in his \u201cforgeries of jealousy\u201d speech from A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream. Hubris, overreach, ego and desire, and an earth screaming for it all to stop. It\u2019s the euphoria of end days that Rosefeldt\u2019s fascinating and visually beautiful work can\u2019t quite bring itself to imagine.Euphoria will be shown in Melbourne town hall until 18 June, as part of Rising festival. Free tickets are available on Fridays until allocation exhausted","215":"In 2018, writers Phil Lord and Rodney Rothman gave us a delirious and utterly unexpected new web-spin on the infinite self-replication of Marvel Comics IP and its most reliable hero, Spider-Man. Instead of yet another MCU live action version, directed and produced in that hard, depthless CGI light, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse was a brilliantly inventive animated fantasia about the Spidey mythology, riffing on movies and comic books. The Spider-Verse was a cosmos in which different Spider-folk existed in parallel: a multiverse at least as interesting as that of Dr Strange, and more interesting than the solemn awards-prestige of Everything Everywhere All at Once. Everyone who saw it wondered how this kaleidoscopic new take could be applied elsewhere: James Bond: Across the James-Bond-Verse, or Bilbo Baggins: Beyond the Bilbo-Baggins-Verse.Now we have a sequel subtitled Across the Spider-Verse \u2013 could it be that they wanted a certain Beatles track and Apple wouldn\u2019t let them? \u2013 with a threequel (Beyond the Spider-Verse) in the pipeline. This second instalment features a plethora of Spideys and the result is as crazily frantic and eyeball-frazzling as ever, but with something exhausting about it now. Its funny jokes \u2013 including a gag about the \u201cSpider-Men pointing at each other\u201d meme \u2013 and poignant touches get obscured in the endless maelstrom. But there\u2019s no doubting the full-tilt energy, the pure blizzard of narrative data and the twists and turns that it would be unsporting to reveal.Miles Morales (voiced by Shameik Moore) is a Spider-Man whose parents are naturally exasperated by his unreliability; Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld) is a super arachnid in her own universe and, like Miles, has a parent in law enforcement. (This is her dad, although it isn\u2019t immediately clear why her gender-flipped status doesn\u2019t entitle her to a cop mom.) There\u2019s also a Spider-Man India (Karan Soni) and a grown-up Peter Parker (Jake Johnson). Miles is threatened by an enemy connected to his original calamitous spider bite and an existential crisis looms.These Spider-Man movies supercharge and hyperamplify the existing potent teen metaphor of identity in Stan Lee\u2019s great creation. Peter Parker was unable to \u201ccome out\u201d as Spider-Man to his parents or his friends; his Spidey-ness was a core part of his bodily being, a superpower and yet a burden, introduced into his bloodstream from that spider bite. Now this secret is upgraded to a cosmic range of possibilities; to be Spider-Man is no longer to be alone, rather, it is to be part of a global range of Spider-people who are different. Viewers have been invited to identify with Spider-Man since the first adaptations of the comic book in the 60s, and are now given a choice of how to identify. It\u2019s dynamic and intriguing, though the detail and the emotion can get lost in the splurge. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is released on 1 June in Australia, and 2 June in the US and UK.","216":"Ever wondered what would happen if someone stole a bunch of head-scratching mystery riffs from Now You See Me, The Adjustment Bureau, Memento and The Matrix, stuck them in a blender with an assortment of late-80s straight-to-video neo-noirs, and then pressed go without closing the lid, thereby causing the resultant volcanic eruption to merrily redecorate the world? Well, wonder no more, because here\u2019s co-writer\/director Robert Rodriguez with one he prepared earlier \u2013 splattering the cinema screen with all the colours of the daft, courtesy of an A-list star, a B-movie aesthetic, a C-minus musical score, and a D\/E audience rating (Hypnotic has already failed to mesmerise in the US). Rejoice, fans of big-screen trash, as Oscar-winner Ben Affleck invites you to join him on a journey that will test your head, and your mind, and your brain\u2026Affleck is in maximum frowny mode as Daniel Rourke, a detective haunted by memories of his young daughter\u2019s abduction. The culprit pleaded \u201cnot guilty due to mental incapacity\u201d after claiming to have no memory of the kidnapping, or of the child\u2019s whereabouts. It sounds like a ruse, until Rourke finds himself playing cat-and-mouse with a criminal mastermind (William Fichtner) blessed with unholy powers of persuasion. \u201cAre you familiar with the concept of hypnotic constructs?\u201d asks Diana Cruz (Alice Braga), a \u201cdime-store psychic\u201d who delivers Basil Exposition-style speeches about \u201chypnotics\u201d \u2013 people with \u201cthe ability to actually influence the brain over a psychic bandwidth. Telepaths just read the mind; hypnotics reshape its reality.\u201dMuch of this dialogue, including the immortal line \u201cHe erased his own mind?!\u201d, is at once overripe yet still oddly soft-boiled. As for the mise-en-sc\u00e8ne, the early movements are all baked exteriors and strip-club-lighting interiors, with heavily coded reds, blues and greens. Later, when the big reveal happens, everything goes white, signalling that a light has been shone on all these mysteries \u2013 although it all continues to make no sense.Rodriguez and co-scripter Max Borenstein, who wrote the 2014 Godzilla reboot and created the Minority Report TV series, go on a thematic shoplifting spree, snatching psychic pushes from Stephen King\u2019s Firestarter, dozy psycho-crime plot twists from Primal Fear, and Philip K Dick false memories from Blade Runner, Total Recall et al. At times I was reminded of the 2015 thriller Solace, in which Anthony Hopkins helped the FBI by functioning as a sort of psychic satnav. Somehow, this is even sillier.One minute Rodriguez is churning out sub-Inception world-bending hallucination scenes, the next he\u2019s nodding his head toward Hitchcock as someone creeps towards a shower room brandishing a large pair of scissors (Herrmannesque strings ahoy!). Affleck does a lot of eyes-closed, big-face acting to indicate just how conflicted his character feels, while Braga does an impressive job of not laughing while delivering lines such as \u201cPain can keep the mind awake\u201d, or \u201cHe was already dead; I set him free\u201d.Sunglasses are worn indoors, scenery is chewed through sucked teeth (hats off to a scene-stealing Jackie Earle Haley for adding a fleeting note of uncharacteristic understatement) and a chase scene climaxes with a white van banging into a golf cart as everything implodes in a sub-Truman Show mess. Meanwhile composer Rebel Rodriguez leads the audience by the hand, with tinkly keyboard cues telling us when things are supposed to be sad, thumpy bash-bash noises pumping up the action scenes, and big quasi-Zimmer honks reminding us that his dad is essentially doing Christopher Nolan on the cheap.While the result may be preposterous tosh from start to finish (a nippy 94 minutes \u2013 hooray!), there\u2019s fun to be had in scenes of a man attempting to pull his own hand off while under the influence, and in gunfights that turn into staring competitions and then end with everyone simply shooting themselves in the foot. Since Rodriguez\u2019s back catalogue contains such knowing pulp as the vampire actioner From Dusk Till Dawn and the grindhouse pastiche Planet Terror, one presumes that he knows exactly how ridiculous this all is, and has his tongue planted firmly in his cheek throughout. Or maybe not. The fact that I\u2019m not entirely sure simply adds to the guilty pleasure.","217":"Due to a combination of climate change and state neglect, giant wildfires raged through millions of hectares of land in northeastern Siberia in the summer of 2021. Classified as \u201ccontrol zones\u201d by the Russian government, the region gets little aid from officials; the cost of combating fires is considered to be excessive compared to the damage done. Focusing on the rural village of Shologon, Alexander Abaturov\u2019s evocative documentary chronicles the heroic efforts of the indigenous community to protect their homes.Largely populated by elderly people, women and children, Shologon has little equipment to slow the deadly spread of \u201cthe Dragon\u201d, the locals\u2019 nickname for the powerful forest fires. What they possess in spades, however, is astonishing resilience and camaraderie in the face of unprecedented calamity. Images of the villagers swathed in clouds of black smoke are accompanied by a child\u2019s reading of an ancient folk tale, which speaks of a mighty and toxic wind \u2013 a profound juxtaposition that connotes how their fight for survival has existed for generations.Languidly oscillating between a wintry snow-white landscape, the orange hue of the fires and the blue of the villagers\u2019 traditional clothing, the astonishing cinematography (by Paul Guilhaume) evokes the hand-tinted, expressionistic visuals of nature documentaries from the silent era. Visually gorgeous as it is, the film\u2019s deliberately laconic style occasionally runs the risk of reducing a pressing issue into abstraction. Considering how remote Shologon is, more contextual information on the area\u2019s society and politics would have made Paradise an even more substantial work of nonfiction. Paradise is released on 26 May at Bertha DocHouse, London.","218":"The ninth feature in a hugely popular Chinese animated series directed by Lin Yongchang and Shao Heqi, Boonie Bears: Guardian Code is also the franchise\u2019s highest-grossing film, second behind The Wandering Earth 2 as the biggest Chinese film of 2023 so far. With its two main characters Bramble and Briar, adorable bears who were abandoned by their mother in a forest fire, this environmentally conscious adventure is an entertaining, if rather formulaic, ride.For lovers of cute animals, the CGI designs of the brothers are quite lovely and detailed, though not exactly distinctive. Goofy and optimistic Bramble believes that their mother is out there searching for them, but Briar holds no such hope. However, a chance encounter with Charlotte, an aspiring scientist, promises a new clue that would lead the pair to their long-lost mummy. What follows is an extravaganza of good versus evil, bears versus bots.There\u2019s a curious paradox here: while Boonie Bears: Guardian Code\u2019s plot points are absolutely generic, their execution remains rather well done. Fashioned with metallic tentacles for arms, the menacing and gigantic robot used by the villain looks suspiciously similar to the killing droid that terrorises Pixar\u2019s The Incredibles, while a number of twists seem borrowed from older classics. Still, the animation is lively enough that these face-off sequences can still deliver a dose of thrills.In the English-language dub, some of the voice talents are occasionally wooden, but the film compensates for this lack with a nice central song. Boonie Bears: Guardian Code is not going to blow the minds of the adults \u2013 or the more discerning little ones \u2013 but this can make for a fun, though possibly not very memorable, cinema outing. Boonie Bears: Guardian Code is released on 26 May in UK and Irish cinemas.","219":"News that Disney\u2019s live-action(ish) remake of its 1989 animated hit The Little Mermaid would star African American musician and actor Halle Bailey provoked the racist #NotMyAriel hashtag, with Fox News-fed \u201creplacement theory\u201d wingnuts philosophically frottering themselves into a frenzy of fear and loathing.Yet now that the film is finally upon us, it\u2019s hard to imagine how something so utterly innocuous \u2013 not to say bland \u2013 could have caused such upset. OK, so this doesn\u2019t have the timeless cartoon magic of the original (be honest, what \u201clive-action\u201d Disney remake does?), and the two-and-a-quarter hour running time is stretching a point. It\u2019s functionally good-natured rehash fare, bogged down by some watery CG and a few uncomfortable dips into \u201cuncanny valley\u201d, yet buoyed up by Bailey\u2019s winning titular performance.Director Rob Marshall reunites with Mary Poppins Returns screenwriter David Magee, while musicals man-of-the-moment Lin-Manuel Miranda serves as co-producer and songwriter alongside the original film\u2019s composer, Alan Menken. Daveed Diggs and Awkwafina inject a little comic oomph into their weirdly photorealist characters (a crab and a bird respectively), Javier Bardem oozes parental protectiveness as King Triton, and Melissa McCarthy channels the drag-queen spirit of Divine as the Sea Witch Ursula, centrepiece of an impressively spectacular FX finale.","220":"Cannes is this year becoming a counterblast to ageism. Italian director Marco Bellocchio, at the age of 83 \u2013 and almost 60 years after he first came to prominence with his 1965 movie Fists in the Pocket \u2013 has created a gripping, heartbreaking true-political crime story from the pages of history. It is a full-tilt melodrama with the passionate vehemence of Victor Hugo or Charles Dickens, which lays bare an ugly formative episode of Europe\u2019s Catholic church: an affair of antisemitism and child abuse.It is based on the true story of Edgardo Mortara, a young Jewish child in Bologna who, in 1858, when he was six, was taken away from his family by the papal authorities. This was done because Edgardo\u2019s doting Catholic nursemaid had claimed that when Edgardo was a baby, and apparently in dire sickness, she had presumed to carry out an emergency baptism, because she feared Edgardo would die and go to limbo. The fanatical Inquisition authorities affected to believe that the Jewish family would therefore \u201csacrifice\u201d the now-Catholic child, and jumped at the chance to punish the Jewish community and inflate their own missionary self-importance. Edgardo, extensively brainwashed, grew up to be a priest and vehement partisan of the church.Enea Sala and Leonardo Maltese play Edgardo as a child and then an adult, and Fausto Russi Alesi and Barbara Ronchi play the boy\u2019s stricken, desperate parents. Fabrizio Gifuni is the ice-cold Bologna inquisitor Father Feletti, and Paolo Pierobon is Pope Pius IX who makes Edgardo his pet and turns the case into a trial of strength between the church and anti-papal nationalists, foreign journalists and of course the Jews, expressing his antisemitism partly though his paranoid distaste for his Rothschild creditor.Bellocchio shows us a brutal convulsion of tyranny, power and bigotry with echoes of the Dreyfus affair in France, and later, horrific events. When the chilling Feletti finally tells a judge that in taking the Jewish child he was merely executing a command from the Vatican, that is a familiar courtroom defence. The kidnapping of young Edgardo is a round-up in miniature, and the pope\u2019s heartlessness a forerunner of Pius XII\u2019s apparent wartime indifference to Nazi atrocities.I thrilled to this movie: the moment when the pope playfully hides Edgardo in his cloak while he plays hide-and-seek is an extraordinary parallel to when he first hid in his mother\u2019s skirts. My heart was in my mouth when Edgardo is carried off by the brutal authorities. And at the end, when the older, agonised Edgardo comes to see his mother on her deathbed, Bellocchio creates a denouement that made me gasp. This already looks like a classic. Kidnapped screened at the Cannes film festival","221":"To say that he\u2019s done it again \u2013 yet again \u2013 is going to mean something different to fans and non-fans. But I have to say the first category is the only place to be for what is simply a terrifically entertaining and lightly sophisticated new comedy from Wes Anderson, in his signature rectilinear, deadpan style, with primary-pastel colours and his all-star repertory ensemble cast. Regulars including Jason Schwartzman and Tilda Swinton are now joined by Scarlett Johansson and Tom Hanks, who have been welcomed into the droll Anderson fold. And the director emphatically proves that the YouTube pasticheurs are like Butlin\u2019s Elvis impersonators: they\u2019re not quite doing it.Asteroid City\u2019s eccentricity, its elegance, its gaiety, and its sheer profusion of detail within the tableau frame make it such a pleasure. So, too, does its dapper styling of classic American pop culture. With every new shot, your eyes dart around the screen, grabbing at all the painterly little jokes and embellishments, each getting a micro-laugh.It is set sometime in the mid-1950s in a US desert town called Asteroid City, named so because 3,000 years ago this was the site of a meteorite landing (\u201casteroid\u201d is not in fact quite accurate, as a meteorite is part of an asteroid). It is now the location for a US government observatory, but it is also where an annual convention takes place honouring the teen inventors of the best high-school science projects; these are of course hilariously scary and advanced, such as a fully functioning death ray. Amusingly, the town has a sign welcoming the nation\u2019s \u201cjunior stargazers and space cadets\u201d, playfully inviting you to assume that the phrase \u201cspace cadet\u201d really did once exist in this non-abusive form. (It didn\u2019t.)Just as the kids and their parents assemble for the proceedings in the hot, dry desert with its fierce, blue sky and yellowish terrain, a staggering event happens \u2013 which is to say, more staggering than the periodic atom bomb tests whose mushroom clouds appear on the horizon. The president decrees that that no one is allowed in or out of town, a strict lockdown will be enforced until the danger is deemed to have passed and these people will just have to live together for a little. Schwartzman plays a widowed war photographer who gets his cranky, grieving father-in-law (Hanks) to come and help look after the kids; he falls for a nearby inventor-kid mom, a movie star played by Johansson. Jeffrey Wright plays the general in charge, Steve Carell is the motel owner, Matt Dillon the town\u2019s mechanic, Rupert Friend is the local singing cowpoke. Hope Davis and Liev Schreiber are among the parents, and everyone is delivering the lines with absolute seriousness.But there is also a framing device that actually acknowledges the artificiality and two-dimensionality of Anderson\u2019s familiar mise-en-sc\u00e8ne, and the invisible proscenium arch within which his dramas appear to be happening. What we are seeing is supposed to be a stage play, though miraculously brought into an approximation of the real world, written by an emotionally fragile dramatist (Edward Norton) who is in a relationship with one of the cast. You can imagine the distant mountains and sandy ground as a stage set, although they might not necessarily be CGI illusions; Asteroid City was shot on location in Spain.As ever, there is little or no emotional content, despite the ostensible subject of grief. The movie rattles cleverly and exhilaratingly along, adroitly absorbing the implications of pathos and loneliness without allowing itself to slow down. It is tempting to consider this savant blankness as some kind of symptom, but I really don\u2019t think so: it is the expression of style. And what style it is. Asteroid City screened at the Cannes film festival and is released on 23 June in UK and Irish cinemas.","222":"Having achieved impressive box office results with its Vermeer film, the Exhibition on Screen strand makes bit of a detour from its comfort zone with its latest film: an overview of artistic takes on Japan\u2019s megalopolis and capital city, ranging from Edo-era paintings to street performance events. Having established itself by largely focusing on the golden eras of art history, dominated by the big names of the Renaissance and the late 19th century, here the net is spread to include contemporary artists who will be (mostly) not especially familiar to non-devotees. And while the conduit for the film is the Tokyo: Art & Photography exhibition staged by Oxford\u2019s Ashmolean museum in 2021, this is far from a standard gallery tour: the approach is near-total immersion in Tokyo itself, along with a series of interviews with a string of practitioners including \u201cgirly photographer\u201d Mika Ninagawa, veteran pop-era painter Keiichi Tanaami, and representatives of a wacky collective called Chim-Pom.The results are as handsome as ever, with the film dominated by spectacular photography of Tokyo\u2019s urban landscape in all its glory. For rather obvious reasons, not much of the city survives from before the second world war, but there are traces of ancient Japan to be seen, and accounts \u2013 through 17th-century depictions of the marshy, sparsely populated locale \u2013 of the embryonic Edo before it became the fortress of the Tokugawa shogunate. These days we are of course much more familiar with the Blade Runner-esque city of glowing neon and retrofitted chaos, but Tokyo as shown here seems to have moved on again, with plenty of pristine new-builds and fancy monuments.How much you respond to this film will, no doubt, depend on your response to the artists involved; they all come across as approachable, enthusiastic and articulate. You can see, though, that this is a riskier film for Exhibition on Screen than, say, Leonardo: The Works or Van Gogh\u2019s Sunflowers \u2013 or even those on more shadowy figures such as Mary Cassatt or Edward Hopper. Even so, there\u2019s a lot to hold the interest here, with the overarching sense of a city of boundless creative energy. Tokyo Stories is released on 23 May in UK and Irish cinemas.","223":"\u201cThere was quite a substantial breeze coming out. A substantial breeze normally would signify a substantial cave.\u201d A nice piece of Brit understatement about what is a late-breaking entry for a wonder of the world: Vietnam\u2019s Hang Son Doong, the largest cave system on the planet by volume, stumbled upon by jungle logger Ho Kh\u1ea3nh in 1991 and only surveyed in 2009. The stupefying shots here of towering limestone buttes, skylight dolines and sodden subterranean rainforest look computer-generated, like something from Avatar.Another visitor points out that where other caves echo each other, Hang Son Doong feels like nothing else on Earth. Predictably, this exceptionalism has dollar signs spinning in the eyes of the Vietnamese government and big business, who are sizing up the grotto for a cable car transit system. Alastair Evans\u2019s slightly ungainly documentary (we only get the history of the cave\u2019s discovery 20 minutes from the end) very thoroughly details the campaign to preserve Hang Son Doong in its natural state in the context of Vietnam\u2019s breakneck economic boom in the period since it was discovered.There\u2019s a noticeable colonial gulf in the gap between tourists, researchers enjoying the cave and the local porters \u2013 which Evans, devoting a section to the latter, is evidently aware of. But a second kind of colonialism isn\u2019t so easily dismissed: that of ecologically minded westerners and urban Vietnamese telling rural people who have only just emerged from penury to go easy on the development. Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh province, where Hang Son Doong is situated, was Vietnam\u2019s poorest, levelled by American bombing and barely redeveloped until the 1990s.Campaigners \u2013 often targets for violent repression by the government \u2013 are pinning their hopes on the so-far responsible urbanisation of Phong Nha, the hub for visits to Hang Son Doong. But more than one person in this scrupulous but depressing film concludes that high-density planning and mass tourism in the region are inevitable, the flows of capital as mighty and unstoppable as the water that gouged out the cave. The sublime views feel a bit consolatory after that. A Crack in the Mountain is released in cinemas on 26 May.","224":"Natalie Portman and Julianne Moore play actor and subject in May December, the enjoyable tale of a fraught creative collaboration that finally promises more than it delivers. Director Todd Haynes adores playing with the pieces of traditional Hollywood cinema, like a kid with a train set, or his mum\u2019s makeup box, to the point where the artifice becomes the main thrust of his story. If May December is guilty of making hysterical mountains out of molehills, then, this is partly the point. That\u2019s Hollywood movies for you. They turn every crisis into a pre-packaged drama.Moore co-stars as Gracie Atherton, a 60-year-old southern belle with a sun-bright smile and a brittle coating of frost. More than two decades ago she fell in love with Joe Yoo, a 13-year-old schoolboy, sparking a nationwide scandal that people remember to this day. Portman is Elizabeth, the actor set to play Gracie in the big-budget film of her life. \u201cYou look taller on television, but we\u2019re basically the same size,\u201d Gracie marvels, welcoming the star to her seafront Georgia home. Elizabeth agrees: \u201cWe\u2019re basically the same.\u201dNaturally Elizabeth\u2019s job is impersonating other people, but you soon start to wonder if she\u2019s going too method this time. Gracie is now (seemingly happily) married to Joe (Charles Melton), who has grown up to become a handsome, round-shouldered 30-something family man. Elizabeth duly sits Joe down for an interview, but she appears to be channelling the younger version of Gracie. Back in the day, we are told, the lovers were exposed when they were caught in-flagrante in the back of a pet shop \u2013 of all the undignified places to be found. Elizabeth visits the spot and prostrates herself in the doorway, simulating sex with a ghost in the name of research.Haynes\u2019s film \u2013 which competes for the Cannes Palme d\u2019Or \u2013 sets itself up as a tense chamber piece, a study of merging identities and shifting power dynamics in the manner of Joseph Losey\u2019s The Servant or Ingmar Bergman\u2019s Persona. But May December also comes coloured by the lurid downlight of tabloid culture. It could be a pastiche of a psychological thriller, or a playfully misdirected daytime afternoon soap. Much of the action, for instance, is accompanied by a crashing four-note piano refrain that surely signals imminent disaster were it not for the fact that it\u2019s deployed at the most ostensibly humdrum moments. It lands like a bomb as Elizabeth crosses the street to the community centre. It explodes once again when Gracie pulls open the door to her fridge. \u201cI don\u2019t think we have any hot dogs,\u201d she says.Inevitably Elizabeth\u2019s research trip stirs up buried resentments, past traumas. It\u2019s possible that Gracie and Joe have spun a self-serving story of their life together \u2013 and told it louder and louder so as to drown out the chorus of disapprovaling voices outside. But even self-actualisation has limits. These two could have been creating a fiction all along.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotionWhen shooting her film roles, Elizabeth prefers lots of takes. She insists each take carries her that bit closer to the truth. The evidence, though, suggests the majority of movies are themselves like hot dogs: processed, synthetic and garnished with tasty sauce. Haynes\u2019s drama, to its credit, is aware of the issue and shows its repercussions \u2013 the way it reduces the performers and the people they portray \u2013 but it\u2019s too knowing and glossy to drive this message home. Elizabeth\u2019s ridiculous film-within-a-film is surely bound to miss its mark. For all its relish and abandon, I fear that May December does too.","225":"Martin Scorsese\u2019s western true-crime thriller is about the US\u2019s Osage murders of the early 1920s, based on the nonfiction bestseller by David Grann. With co-writer Eric Roth, Scorsese crafts an epic of creeping, existential horror about the birth of the American century, a macabre tale of quasi-genocidal serial killings which mimic the larger erasure of Native Americans from the US. It places in the drama\u2019s foreground a gaslit marriage of lies and poisoned love. It echoes Scorsese\u2019s earlier work about mob violence, mob loyalty and the final, inevitable sellout to the federal authorities, whose own bad faith gradually emerges. But in the end, this film is about what all westerns are about, and perhaps all history: the brutal grab for land, resources and power.Lily Gladstone gives a performance of tragic force as Mollie Burkhart, a Native American woman from the Osage tribe who, like all her people, has become unexpectedly wealthy because the apparently stony and unpromising land in Oklahoma on which the authorities allowed the Osage to settle turned out to have huge reserves of oil. But they are still subject to a racist and infantilising condition of \u201cguardianship\u201d: to claim the income and spend it, Osage individuals need a white co-signatory. And there is something else: Mollie and her family are deeply disturbed by mysterious illnesses which have been killing off Osage people, one by one. Later the bodies of Osage murder-victims are found, including Mollie\u2019s wayward sister Anna (Cara Jade Myers), whose autopsy is bizarrely carried out in the open air, at the crime scene itself.Into this situation arrives a slippery, venal individual called Ernest, played by Leonardo DiCaprio; an ambitious but also submissive and fundamentally inadequate man: greedy, stupid and biddable. He has returned to the US after service in the first world war, and comes to the vast estate of his wealthy uncle, who has offered him a job working alongside his hardfaced brother Byron, played by Scott Shepherd, who has clearly been extensively normalised in the violence and corruption over which the uncle presides.This cattleman-plutocrat is William Hale, played by Robert De Niro, a man of calcified resentment and self-importance who preens himself on his good relations with the Osage people. Hale hires Ernest for a position as his vague underling, courtier and dirty-work factotum, and encourages him to date and also marry Mollie, whom Ernest has already met, which would give him (and therefore Hale) a legal claim on Mollie\u2019s \u201cheadrights\u201d, as her oil entitlements are known. And so Ernest and Mollie\u2019s doomed marriage commences, complicated by the terrible fears of Mollie\u2019s ailing mother, Lizzie Q (Tantoo Cardinal), who has a quietly beautiful death scene. Mollie\u2019s diabetes is also a factor; it is made strangely worse by the medicine Hale has procured for her, and which Ernest administers while always simpering and blubbing his concern for her declining health.When the situation becomes too bad for the federal authorities to ignore, Washington DC sends an officer of its fledgling Bureau of Investigations (later to be the FBI). This is Tom White, played by Jesse Plemons. But Scorsese shows us the politics: the bureau\u2019s belated appearance appears to be, at least partly, a matter of containing the difficult situation involving the white people and the inescapably wealthy Osage peoples, and reinforcing federal control over the new state of Oklahoma.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotionAs performed by Gladstone and DiCaprio, the relationship between Mollie and Ernest has a kind of spiritual nausea; Ernest is sincere about his feelings for his wife, in his way, but they are part of a context of bad faith and violence. His real relationship is of course with his uncle, he is the beta to the older man\u2019s alpha. Weirdly, DiCaprio starts to look like DeNiro, like a dog resembling its master: a younger, victim-villain version with the same gimlet-eyed fear and hostility and the same rat-trap mouth with the corners turned down. His uncle has inducted him into the Masons, and it is into the local masonic hall, with all its regalia, that Hale leads the wretched Ernest for a corporal punishment scene when the young man lets him down \u2013 the most extraordinary corporal punishment I have seen since Lindsay Anderson\u2019s If\u2026.Hale\u2019s rule, so avowedly caring and sensitive to the Osage, is in fact creating a vast dysfunction of depression, alcoholism, lawlessness, fatal illness and murder. Gladstone creates a persona for Mollie that is flawed and self-reproachful, with some shame at having collaborated with her persecutor. She has dignity and calm and rises above the squalor all around her, but that calm is also the stricken immobility of illness. And she knows that Ernest was never any good but she was charmed and seduced by him all the same.Scorsese presents a remarkable story, with an audacious framing device of a briskly insensitive \u201ctrue crime\u201d radio show featuring Osage characters crassly played by white actors. This is an utterly absorbing film, a story that Scorsese sees as a secret history of American power, a hidden violence epidemic polluting the water table of humanity. Killers of the Flower Moon screened at the Cannes film festival, and is released on 20 October in cinemas.","226":"There is real emotional warmth and human sympathy in this otherwise somewhat flawed film, a docudrama experiment in getting actors to play some of the real people in a tragic news story from Tunisia. Olfa Hamrouni, a divorced woman from the coastal town of Sousse, made the headlines seven years ago when two of her four daughters, Rahma and Ghofrane, broke her and their sisters\u2019 hearts by vanishing from the country to become fighters and wives for Islamic State in Syria. Now director Kaouther Ben Hania re-enacts key parts of Olfa\u2019s family life, featuring the remaining sisters Eya and Tayssir playing themselves, but performers playing the vanished fugitives: Ichraq Matar is Ghofrane and Nour Karoui is Rahma.Despite the fact that she hasn\u2019t vanished, and is in fact a vivid and formidable onscreen figure, Olfa is also played by an actor, Hend Sabri, so the procedure is already in fact slightly muddled, though no less intriguing. The performers and real figures are interviewed together, and then scenes are played out, with Olfa coming on to say where they\u2019re going wrong. The actor Majd Mastoura plays Olfa\u2019s distant and abusive father, and the film shows how weirdly upset he becomes to embody a vicious character from the real world.Ben Hania seems to have embarked on this process with an open mind, having no clear idea what light this approach would shed on the case. In fact, I\u2019m not sure how much light is shed on it, and in fact this technique might even be entirely wrong for finding out how and when exactly the two young women became radicalised. Imagining what was going on inside their heads using actorly intuition might not get us very far. In fact, a TV discussion panel clip showing Olfa furiously denouncing the politicians, and saying that their tolerance of jihadist imams after the Arab Spring was what turned her daughters, is a rather shrewd insight of the sort that docudrama does not yield.However, these women have such a presence on screen that their sympathy drives the movie. There is something mysteriously moving about the real Eya and Tayssir being introduced to the actresses playing their sisters, and being awestruck and moved by how similar they are \u2013 and how strange it is to feel the four-way dynamic of their sisterly relationship being restored in this semi-fictionalised form. Four Daughters screened at the Cannes film festival and is in UK and Irish cinemas from 1 March.","227":"Turkish auteur Nuri Bilge Ceylan has delivered another of his expansive, ruminative and distinctly Chekhovian character-driven dramas. Again it is spread out across the landscape of Anatolia, and again there is Ceylan\u2019s emphasis on still photography and portraiture. This film does however have one very atypical touch: a very startling and Brechtian meta-moment when we are reminded this is a film we\u2019re watching, and the tiny and flickeringly firelit interiors are created on a soundstage.It certainly does however have a very typical title: that is, forbidding and slightly disconcerting. In About Dry Grasses\u2019s final section, its lead character is to ponder the fact that the gauntly beautiful terrain of Anatolia seems to have only two seasons. The first is the snow-covered winter in which we get Ceylan\u2019s signature shot of a lonely figure plodding towards the camera in the snow. This suddenly gives way to bright summer, ahe ground will reveal itself to be covered in a featureless dry grass, which has a mysterious fascination in its austere beauty.On the face of it, the film is (yet another) school drama about a teacher whose career is imperilled by a sexual abuse charge from a pupil. Samet (Deniz Celiloglu) is a balding teacher at a state school in the remote region who is very candidly bored with everything \u2013 or almost everything \u2013 and longs for a posting to Istanbul. He is a teacher who prides himself, a bit smugly, on how friendly and approachable he is with the pupils, but is capable of bad-tempered outbursts in which Ceilioglu is very convincing. He shares lodgings with a fellow teacher, the younger and more personable Kenan (Musab Ekici).Samet has a favourite pupil: Sevim (Ece Bagci) a 14-year-old with whom he has flirtatious banter and sometimes puts his arm round. When a heart-bedecked love letter addressed to Samet is found in Sevim\u2019s exercise book by a member of staff, Sevim is humiliated and tearful and Samet is coldly embarrassed: his warm affection to her is replaced by a wary sense that this is going to get him into trouble.And so it proves. Sevim comes to his office, the scene of so many inappropriate chats in the past and begs Samet to give the letter back to her; she instantly senses that his patronising claim to have destroyed it is a lie. In that moment, all her feelings for her teacher are transformed into rage, and this is to result in an abuse claim levelled against both Samet and Kenan. The insecure and prickly Samet suspects that it is the more attractive Kenan who is the prime object of these allegations (left unspecified by the school authorities), and this preposterous competitive streak has implications for his budding relationship with Nuray (Merve Dizdar), a woman who appears to prefer Kenan.Life goes on in this place; the investigation into Samet goes on, his tricky and duplicitious friendship with Kenan goes on and so does his chatty, sarky friendship with other people in the village. It all continues without reaching any very sensational endpoint, yet without feeling anticlimactic either. This film, so apparently forbidding and opaque the way many Ceylan films initially are, has in fact something engrossing in its garrulous and wide-ranging quality: a literary quality in fact. Ceylan endows Samet with the qualities of a wryly observant narrator, disillusioned and unsatisfied and yet generous enough in his way.This is another very absorbing movie from this unique director \u2014 a Cannes Palme winner for his film Winter Sleep \u2014 who thoroughly deserves his continuing A-list status.","228":"Wim Wenders brings a certain awe, or even shock, or even a kind of reverently docu-dramatised PTSD to his film about the German artist Anselm Kiefer. The creator of paintings, photographs, colossal installations and illustrated book artefacts is celebrated but in some quarters criticised for his engagement with German fascism and the Holocaust, mediated through his lifelong love for the poetry of Paul Celan. The film shows us his work in all its giganticism, with minimal archival interview material, though there are some fancifully conceived but successfully executed fantasy scenes of the artist in boyhood and young adulthood. The title perhaps intends the use of his first name not in any relaxed way, but in a style comparable to Leonardo or Michelangelo.This is a film which Wenders presents in 3D, just as he did with his study of Pina Bausch in 2011 \u2013 the effect of the three dimensions there was to accentuate the physicality of the dancers. Here it has a more architectural effect, especially when we are in Kiefer\u2019s studio areas, such as his huge 40-hectare atelier site La Ribaute in Barjac, near N\u00eemes in the south of France, which, with all its huge exhibition spaces and sculpture gardens is virtually this creator\u2019s own city state. The 3D delineates the vast forms and monumental structures that loom up and out of the screen: we are immersed in this place in the way visitors would be, maybe even more so, as the camera is mounted on drones and platforms, and the film always encourages you go into cathedral-rubbernecker mode.There is fascination \u2013 and trepidation \u2013 in watching the master at work, strolling or cycling around his vast warehouse, with creations piled or stacked in every corner. Does he employ assistants? The film doesn\u2019t really show any, but there are some people doing the humbler tasks of helping him with the machinery he needs, especially when he is creating vast moodscape canvases in which the materials are charred and burned. This is a film of great seriousness and severity, although there are laughs of a gobsmacked nature to be had when you see Kiefer with an actual flamethrower, incinerating the straw-matted surface of a painting, to get that texture of devastation, though he is accompanied by someone whose job it is to spray water on the surface immediately afterwards to make sure things don\u2019t get out of control. Kiefer appears in this film to be a dedicated cigar smoker: fortunately, he doesn\u2019t have one lit while he\u2019s doing this, but the insurance bills must be sky-high.Kiefer\u2019s angry, passionate, haunted images are driven, of course, by Germany\u2019s dark past, and Wenders\u2019s film persuasively suggests that it is in the ruins of 1945, the year of the artist\u2019s birth, that the seed of inspiration is to be found. The unforgettable images of shattered Berlin give us the dark uproar from which Kiefer\u2019s work is thrown out. In a confrontationally transgressive and satirical spirit, Kiefer created work derived from fascist or Nazi iconology, or the 19th-century German mythic tropes that the Nazis manipulated. But Wenders\u2019s film gives some space to Kiefer\u2019s detractors, who suggest that he is riding an updraft of demonic inspiration and his work is having its anti-fascist cake and eating it. Kiefer himself is shown in old footage repudiating these suggestions although the issue is not raised in the present tense. It is possible still to be agnostic about the macho grandeur of Kiefer\u2019s work and the \u201cheadless women\u201d ball dresses that occupy the film\u2019s opening section. Yet this is a superbly controlled and expressed film and its high seriousness about the nature and purpose of art really is invigorating. Anselm screened at the Cannes film festival; it is released on 8 December in UK cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema.","229":"After making last year\u2019s Loveland, a heavily ponderous and unsubtle sci-fi film set in Hong Kong, the Indigenous auteur Ivan Sen \u2013 most famous for directing the Mystery Road movies \u2013 has returned to crime in the sun-scorched desert. And damn it\u2019s great to have him back doing outback noir, because Sen is so bloody good at it. His latest work, Limbo, is an eerily meditative production with top-notch performances and a harshly beautiful monochrome veneer.Simon Baker leads the cast as Travis Hurley, a tough, sorrowful, heroin-injecting detective with a buzzcut and a downbeat, Walter White-ish demeanour. At one point a child accurately observes that he looks more like a drug dealer than a member of the force.The film is set in the titular \u2013 fictitious \u2013 opal mining town, where Hurley arrives to ask questions about the unsolved murder case of an Indigenous girl, Charlotte Hayes, 20 years before.The addled cop is a bit of a trope: they may wrestle with the demon drink (like Aaron Pedersen in Goldstone), be afflicted by physical ailments (Brendan Cowell\u2019s tinnitus-suffering constable in Noise) or have a traumatic, personal connection to the scene of the crime (Eric Bana in The Dry). But Baker transcends stereotype, bringing sleepy-eyed and sorrowful gravitas, with lots of thousand-yard stares and a slow way of speaking, as if Hurley is aware that time moves differently in this part of the world.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningIn reality the central location is Coober Pedy \u2013 the bizarre South Australian town where citizens live in underground dugouts to escape the blistering heat. Is it possible to maintain a circadian rhythm down there? Or is time itself stuck in limbo: never really day and never really night?This striking location, captured in Warwick Thornton\u2019s vampire series Firebite, is presented by the multi-hyphenate Sen (also Limbo\u2019s cinematographer, writer, editor and composer) in the aforementioned spartan-looking monochrome, which adds an extra layer of spareness to environments that already have a vast and empty feeling. The film looks better the closer Sen\u2019s cameras get to the ground \u2013 birds-eye drone shots, which the director has deployed before, losing their earthy lustre and becoming oddly mechanical-looking in black and white.Sign up to Saved for LaterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsafter newsletter promotionThe monochrome aesthetic is also a bit of a pathos-o-matic, helping the cast hit their plaintive notes. Sometimes characters converse as if there\u2019s vast valleys between them; sometimes they cut right to the bone. When Hurley informs the victim\u2019s brother Charlie (Rob Collins) that he\u2019s revisiting the case with \u201cfresh eyes\u201d, Charlie responds: \u201cWe needed fresh eyes 20 fuckin\u2019 years ago.\u201dPart of the film\u2019s lingering sadness comes from the knowledge that Hurley, and the police force he represents, is doing far too little, far too late. We know that authorities would have handled the case very differently had the murdered girl been white.An ageing white man, Joseph (a very scabby-looking Nicholas Hope), might know something about what happened: he certainly seems to have regrets, though here they\u2019re not in short supply. The victim\u2019s sister Emma (Natasha Wanganeen) is a little more welcoming than Charlie, though everybody in this film has a lost, faded look in their eyes. These are people who don\u2019t seem to hope for much, other than perhaps to be left alone. The cast, in weather-beaten and woebegone mode, are uniformly excellent, directed by Sen in beautiful unison, their performances different notes in the same melody.Limbo isn\u2019t, as you might have guessed, the kind of film in which all wrongs are righted and truth and justice restored. The story has an aura of compelling pointlessness, odd as that may sound, stemming from the sheer distance felt between the crucially important events of the past \u2013 when Charlotte disappeared and the \u201creal\u201d drama occurred \u2013 and the hazy aftermath of the present. Elements of the script share similarities with Stan\u2019s series Black Snow, in which another dozy detective, played by Travis Fimmel, tries to find the truth about a terrible crime many years after the fact.From a structural point of view, Black Snow took the easy option, flashing between past to present. Limbo is all about the gap between then and now, about being dislocated from time, unable to move forwards or backwards and too old to start again; the state of the characters\u2019 lives, in other words.Sen achieves something quite difficult: telling a story not about action or intrigue per se, but turning the dramatic arena into something more like an ellipsis: an ever-unanswerable space, where crucial things are omitted. It takes a calculated, studious sort of audacity to make a film like this, and a deep-thinking humanitarianism to fill it with such pathos.Limbo   premiered at Berlin film festival; it is out in cinemas in Australia from 18 May","230":"Steve McQueen\u2019s monumental film is a vast survey-meditation on the wartime history and psychogeography of his adopted city: Amsterdam, based on his wife Bianca Stigter\u2019s Dutch-language book Atlas of an Occupied City, Amsterdam 1940-1945.With a calm and undemonstrative narrative voiceover from Melanie Hyams, the film tracks day-to-day life in Amsterdam under Nazi rule. It spans the invasion in 1940; the establishment of the NSB, the collaborationist Dutch Nazi party; the increasingly brutal repression and deportation of Jewish populations to the death camps; and then the \u201chunger winter\u201d of 1944 to 1945 as food and fuel became scarce in the city and the Nazis displayed a gruesome mix of panic and fanaticism as the allies closed in.What McQueen does is effectively represent the maps and figure legends of the book on screen: the camera shows us the modern-day indoor and outdoor scenes on individual streets, canals, squares, buildings and jetties where the barbarity unfolded \u2013 but shows them as they are now, with 21st-century people going about their business while Hyams\u2019 narration coolly summarises what happened in each particular spot, sometimes adding that the original building has been \u201cdemolished\u201d. A prison yard where Jews were forced to parade around chanting: \u201cI am a Jew, beat me to death, it\u2019s my own fault\u201d is now an open space overlooked by the Hard Rock Cafe. The headquarters of the secret police was on the site of what is now a school.Occupied City lasts a little more than four hours, with an intermission, and the effect is something like an huge cinematic frieze or tapestry, or perhaps an installation. But it is also like an old fashioned \u201ccity symphony\u201d movie, and, in its approach, perhaps bears the influence of Claude Lanzmann\u2019s Shoah. It asks hard questions of what we think about the gulf between past and present. When we think about Nazi rule in Amsterdam, we think of \u2026 what? Flickering black-and-white newsreel footage, semi-familiar landmarks in monochrome, images of swastikas, an alien display of history, vacuum-sealed in the past. But McQueen shows us the modern world, in 4K resolution and there is a gradual realisation that for those involved in 1940, the Nazi occupation of Amsterdam happened just like this: in living colour in the here-and-now, with modern hairstyles and clothes.Sometimes there is a disconnect between past and present. The site of a bygone horror might in 2023 be a scene of happiness: people ice-skating on a frozen canal and having innocent fun. At some other place we see a commemorative event: the laying of wreaths. At other times, there will be a parallel: in Dam Square the Nazi occupiers erected a bandstand; now we see a stage for outdoor performance. And then there are other, serious engagements with history and politics. We see an official statement of apology for colonialism and slavery; we see a huge and boisterous \u201cclimate strike\u201d by young people and an event for the murdered Dutch investigative journalist Peter R de Vries. The effect is to show us that the past and present are not clear, with distinct layers of old\/significant and new\/insignificant: it is more fluid than that.Occasionally, there is a weird frisson. Some of McQueen\u2019s footage was shot during the Covid lockdown and the juxtaposition of this with Nazi oppression takes us \u2013 unintentionally \u2013 perhaps a little close to GB News territory. And audiences might be surprised at how little emphasis is placed on Anne Frank: it could well be that McQueen wanted to take us away from well-trodden arguments, and certainly to move away from the modern tourist cliches of coffee shops and sex worker windows. Although on that last point there is another eerie historical echo in the way in which sexual activity between occupier and occupied was variously policed, tolerated and punished.In its scale and seriousness, Occupied City allows its emotional implication to amass over its running time. The effect is mysterious and moving. Occupied City screened at the Cannes film festival and is released on 9 February in UK and Irish cinemas.","231":"Bill Forsyth\u2019s wonderfully wistful and charming comedy is rereleased after 40 years, and its happy-sad aroma is still as pungent as ever. It has a claim to be the last movie with the authentic spirit of the Ealing comedies; although with a longer perspective we can also see how it\u2019s also indirectly influenced by producer David Puttnam in its high-minded spirit of Anglo-American amity.The scene is a fictional fishing village in western Scotland, making its modest living from the lobster bound for the fancy restaurants of London and Paris, but which the locals can\u2019t afford to eat. Peter Riegert plays Mac, a junior oil executive from Texas obsessed with work and material values, who has been tasked by his eccentric billionaire boss, Felix Happer, to travel to this village and persuade the entire community to sell up so that Happer can build a refinery there and capitalise on the new gush of North Sea oil. (There is a scene in which Happer appears to get a call from Margaret Thatcher in person.) Happer is played with unique brio and gusto by Burt Lancaster, whose legendary presence in itself confers something magical on the proceedings.Slowly but surely, hard-hearted capitalist Mac is beguiled by the beauty of the place and the gentleness of the locals, including the local hotelier-slash-accountant Gordon Urquhart, played by Denis Lawson; and poor Mac falls unrequitedly in love with his wife, Stella (Jennifer Black). There is also the refinery\u2019s researcher Danny Oldsen, played by a boyish Peter Capaldi; there is nothing here of the brutal political spin doctor he played on TV\u2019s The Thick of It, but in the part\u2019s wit and whimsy, you might see the ghost of Capaldi\u2019s other great role: Doctor Who.Danny has himself formed a tendresse for the company\u2019s marine biologist Marina (played with dry wit by Jenny Seagrove), who swims with mermaid grace around the shore. Perhaps all too late, Mac confronts two dilemmas: he is falling in love with a landscape and a community that he is there to destroy, and he realises that his money-grubbing life in the big city is pretty pointless. In any case, the deal might not even go through: a hermit figure called Ben, who owns the beach, might not sell. He is played with terrific presence by Fulton Mackay \u2013 a lovely performance, and very different from his fierce prison warder in TV\u2019s Porridge.In the early 80s, the idea of building an oil refinery didn\u2019t have the frisson of darkness that it might have now, although this movie certainly saw that drilling for oil meant despoiling nature, and also that the oil business had a high-handed attitude to local communities who didn\u2019t speak English. (The script skates over the question of whether Happer would pay the locals as much money for building an observatory as he would for an oil refinery.) But Local Hero snares your heart because it takes on a fantasy element: something to do with Happer\u2019s visionary obsession with the stars. When he arrives in Scotland by helicopter, it\u2019s as if he\u2019s comes down from another planet: America. It\u2019s such a pleasure to see it again. Local Hero is released on 19 May in cinemas.","232":"Lenny Henry makes it look like the simplest thing in the world. He saunters on looking as if he will deliver a glorious turn. He ends by being seen as a fragment of dreadful history. It is rare for an actor to arouse the reaction that Henry gets when he comes on stage. It is recognition, expectation and exhilaration.Yet also something else. The audience seem to be saying: you are ours. A star, but one who will take us by the hand. Now he exercises the same power with his first play \u2013 a one-hander \u2013 in which he involves an audience in the appalling government treatment of the Windrush generation.Henry\u2019s writing is so direct, so chattily circumstantial, that it is sometimes hard to remember that August in England is not autobiography. He speaks as August, a man who came to the UK from Jamaica when he was eight (\u201cSo did I,\u201d shouts a woman in the row behind me), and found his father in bed with a woman not his wife. He got over it, formed a band (Black Fist), fell in love with a girl who watched him, paying more attention to his trousers than his face, had three children \u2013 whose photos are pinned at the back of the stage \u2013 suffered terribly at the death of his life companion, but also behaved badly. Oh, and discovered new love at the dentist.For all Henry begins cockahoop, hip swirling, bum winking, this is the opposite of a showoff show. Directed by Daniel Bailey and Lynette Linton, he takes his spectators deep into relaxed everyday life. Events are so humdrum that when the manila envelopes start arriving, questioning his right to live in England, they seem dotty, almost comical. Anyone would ignore them. Outrage lands eventually \u2013 with the demand he leave his home and go to the Jamaica he left more than 40 years earlier. Along with others. In the closing moments, documentary footage of Windrush evictees flashes up \u2013 and Henry himself quietly leaves the stage. Never has a history felt less like a case study.Thirty years ago this month, Derek Jarman made his last film. Blue was an urgent report from the frontline, chronicling the days in which Aids was causing the artist to go blind. The visual content was steady, intense: an unchanging screen of Yves Klein blue; the words were drawn from Jarman\u2019s diaries; and Jarman\u2019s own voice is heard, lowered, with interesting QE2 vowels.Blue was an evocation, and an act of bravery: telling the truth \u2013 both stark and elaborate, personal and mythical \u2013 in the face of fear and homophobia. Now Neil Bartlett has revisited the work with live performers: the result, Blue Now, is faithful to the original but less explosive.The screen is the same; unmoving, though when shades of delphinium, cobalt and cornflower are mentioned, it can seem to spring new depths. The words \u2013 apart, I think, from a mention of Kyiv alongside Bosnia \u2013 are unchanged. There are glimpses of the Styx, and a medical tally: 30 pills a day, some too big to swallow. Jarman thinks his diseased eye looks like a planet; his oculist suggests it is more like a pizza. Hours of uncertainty are recorded: \u201cHell is a Waiting Room.\u201dThe crunch of shingle and the whirring of the washing machine are familiar, but there is a new silky weave of electronic music composed by Simon Fisher Turner, who provided the original soundscape. Four narrators are also visible in front of the screen: Travis Alabanza, Jay Bernard, Joelle Taylor and Russell Tovey. Their voices are distinctive, but none overperform; each has a strong connection to the words. To the side, Ali Gordon provides another performance element, signing dextrously, hands swaying and diving to conjure music as well as words.It is a valuable recall, scrupulous and heartfelt. Yet no longer delivered by the writer at a time of danger, speaking to a less hostile world, it is not so much defiant as reverent. Not a gauntlet thrown down but homage offered up.No\u00ebl Coward is in the theatrical air. At the National, his music is rippling in The Motive and the Cue. At the Donmar, Private Lives is being staged as a drama of domestic thuggery. Now Daniel Raggett directs Coward\u2019s most startling play, Though awkward around the edges, it features a dazzling central duo: Joshua James and Lia Williams (in real life mother and son) play the drug-addled young man and his mother, carrying on with a chap of about his age.At its premiere in 1924, when Coward himself starred, understudied by John Gielgud, The Vortex shocked with addiction, a suggestion of incest and lashings of adultery. It carries a further surprise for those who, overlooking the full-on patriotism of In Which We Serve, think of the playwright as a dandy in a dressing gown: its language is at times so forthright, so apparently un-Cowardly. Though darkness is at first undercover, an hour and a half later the sheath of wit is removed. The play ends in melodrama and moral denunciation.It is a hard arc to make convincing but Joanna Scotcher\u2019s design charts it excitingly. The opening scene is amber and padded and tasselled and peach \u2013 and, oh, the pouffes! The closing moments are so bleak and bare that we might be watching Samuel Beckett: the furniture has gone; a strange, smoky delirium (lit by Zoe Spurr) has flitted and passed, and now all is bleached and exposed: mother and son are confronting the facts of their hectic, wretched lives.Raggett\u2019s emphatic production is not quick enough to make the revelations and accusations really surprising. Yet Williams and James set the stage alight. He moves with a lassitude that at first seems nonchalance but becomes more saturnine as despair and addiction take over: sprawled on his back, he looks like an empty suit. Williams does not do the obvious raddled thing. Darting, arms waving like wings, checking her hair before she hugs, she is convincingly youthful. Yet hunched with her back to the audience, in a white dress of many plumy layers, she could be a dying swan.Star ratings (out of five)August in England \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605Blue Now \u2605\u2605\u2605The Vortex \u2605\u2605\u2605August in England is at the Bush theatre, London, until 10 JuneBlue Now is touring until 27 MayThe Vortex is at the Chichester Festival Theatre until 20 May","233":"One of the great privileges of writing about dance is that sometimes you find yourself in a rehearsal room when a ballet is being remounted, listening to one generation of dancers passing on to the next what they have been taught by a previous generation.One of the pleasures of Links in the Chain, Lynne Wake\u2019s 2021 documentary about Frederick Ashton, is that it allows you to eavesdrop on similar conversations. Screening at a special event at the Royal Academy of Dance in London on Tuesday, with guest speakers including dancers Vadim Muntagirov and Francesca Hayward, it\u2019s a beautifully edited insight into what Christopher Nourse of the Ashton foundation calls \u201cthe DNA of what is a national ballet\u201d.The 40-minute film mixes archive footage and interviews of great Royal Ballet performances of the past with today\u2019s dancers talking about what they have learned about the style created by the company\u2019s founding choreographer. They emphasise the almost sacred nature of the steps. Anthony Dowell remembers that having a role created on you by Ashton was \u201clike the holy grail\u201d; when he teaches the Dance of the Blessed Spirits to Muntagirov, the younger dancer talks about hoarding each word \u201clike a treasure\u201d.Wayne Eagling created the role of Hamlet in Ashton\u2019s Hamlet Prelude in 1977. His part was meant to be danced by Rudolf Nureyev; Ashton worked with Eagling while waiting for his star to turn up. \u201cBut then Rudolf did one performance and I did 15,\u201d Eagling remembers. His partner in the work was the 58-year-old Margot Fonteyn. Her part was \u201ca reminiscence of all the roles\u201d that Ashton had made for her.Watching Fonteyn dance in rare film of Symphonic Variations in 1946, you note the freedom, as well as the steely technique. Seeing Hayward and William Bracewell learn the roles, new emphases emerge even as Eagling recalls the intent, essence and shapes of Ashton\u2019s choreography. As Bracewell wisely remarks: \u201cYou give a different generation the same steps and they do them differently. That\u2019s the beauty of it. It\u2019s evolving.\u201d Wake wisely and sensitively records it all. It is utterly fascinating.Frederick Ashton: Links in the Chain screening and Q&A is at the Royal Academy of Dance, London SW11, 16 May, 6.30pm. The documentary can also be viewed online via the Frederick Ashton Foundation\u2019s YouTube channel","234":"\u201cI\u2019m not pathetic,\u201d declares actor turned activist Michael J Fox early on in this intimate, uplifting and frequently very funny documentary about his life. \u201cI\u2019ve got shit going on. I\u2019m a tough son of a bitch.\u201d On the evidence presented here \u2013 a dazzling collage of interviews, dramatisations, snappily chosen film and TV clips, family footage and narrated biography \u2013 it\u2019s hard to disagree.Having achieved stardom in his early 20s, Fox found himself in his 30s hiding from, and then publicly facing up to, a diagnosis of Parkinson\u2019s disease \u2013 a condition that he believed (as many do) only affected older people. As he says with genuine surprise: \u201cI was not someone who was supposed to get this.\u201d Yet as we learn from this wryly defiant portrait by Davis Guggenheim, whose documentary CV includes the Oscar-winning An Inconvenient Truth and the empowering He Named Me Malala: \u201cSome people would view the news of my disease as an ending, but I was starting to sense that it was really a beginning.\u201dAs a child, Michael Fox (the \u201cJ\u201d was added later as an actorly affectation) was always on the move, constitutionally unable to sit still. It was partly that kinetic quality that landed him teenage roles in TV shows such as Leo and Me in the 1970s, although it wasn\u2019t until he finally bagged the Alex P Keaton character in Family Ties in the early 1980s that his career became anything to write home about (Fox hilariously remembers Robert Redford flossing his teeth throughout his failed audition for the 1980 awards winner Ordinary People).Initially a supporting player, Fox became the star of Family Ties thanks to his electrifying comic timing \u2013 a scene-stealing ability to make the softest of gags land with a bang. No wonder producer Steven Spielberg pursued him for Robert Zemeckis\u2019s sci-fi comedy Back to the Future, which they had already started filming with Eric Stoltz, and that Fox wound up reshooting around the edges of Family Ties. A punishing three-and-a-half months of \u201cconfusion and exhaustion\u201d followed that left Fox wondering: \u201cHow could any of this shit be good?\u201dLooking back on the whirlwind success that followed (Back to the Future and Fox\u2019s \u201cB-grade high school werewolf movie\u201d Teen Wolf held the two top spots at the box office), our self-effacing subject notes: \u201cI was king of the world, [but just] playing a part.\u201d In the reflective present-day interviews, he sports a bruised face after breaking his cheek on the furniture, and explains: \u201cIt\u2019s part of the deal that I fall. Gravity is real, even if you only fall from my height.\u201d It\u2019s a great one-liner that harks back to his earliest awards acceptance speeches (\u201cI feel four feet tall!\u201d) and reminds us that Fox\u2019s wit has only got sharper over the years.As anyone familiar with his written memoirs will know, Fox\u2019s self-deprecation extends to connecting the \u201cdiminished blinking and reduced spontaneity of facial expression\u201d of Parkinson\u2019s with the appearance of \u201ca growing comfort in front of the camera \u2013 less mugging and hamming it up\u201d. It\u2019s a \u201ctough son of bitch\u201d indeed who can conclude they weren\u2019t getting \u201cbetter\u201d, just \u201csicker\u201d, and speak with such candour about the acting tics and drug regimes they employed to hide their symptoms. While frenetic illustrative clips show the energetic young Fox running and jumping his way through Back to the Future and Casualties of War, Guggenheim here mines lesser-known films such as 1993\u2019s The Concierge (AKA For Love or Money) and the TV hit Spin City to illustrate how Fox kept his hands occupied to stave off tremors on camera.The real revelations, however, lie in the depiction of Fox\u2019s family life, most notably his marriage to actor Tracy Pollan, who first won his heart by calling him \u201ca complete fucking asshole\u201d, and whose unswerving love leaves him all but speechless when he\u2019s asked what she means to him, save for one word: \u201cClarity\u201d. Ironically, while the symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s may create the impression that Fox is never at rest, his relationship with Pollan and their children seems to have finally granted him the stillness he never had. As with the singer Edwyn Collins and his wife, Grace Maxwell, in the wonderful 2014 doc The Possibilities Are Endless, we\u2019re left with the feeling that what we are really watching is a great love story. \u201cHow\u2019s Tracy?\u201d Guggenheim asks Fox in one unguarded moment. \u201cMarried to me,\u201d he replies, before adding with perfect timing: \u201c\u2026 still.\u201dIn selected cinemas and on Apple TV+","235":"Pietro and Bruno are brothers in everything but blood. Their friendship was forged during one glorious pre-adolescent summer, when Pietro\u2019s parents rented a house in the Aosta valley in the Italian Alps, in a village in which Bruno was the only remaining child. The lifelong bond between them also links both to the rocky, vertebral peaks that were their childhood playground: as adults, both find themselves drawn to mountains. Bruno (Alessandro Borghi), a montanaro or mountain man at heart, stays put in the Aosta region; nomadic Pietro (Luca Marinelli) roams the world but finds a spiritual home in the Himalayan foothills.There\u2019s another link: Pietro\u2019s father, Giovanni (Filippo Timi), whom his son dismissed as a grey-faced Turin wage slave, finds adventure and release scaling the Alpine trails. As a young adult Pietro drifts away from his parents, while Bruno finds a surrogate father figure in Giovanni. It\u2019s only after the latter\u2019s death that Pietro realises he has missed out on knowing his father at his happiest and most fulfilled. In his honour, the two friends rekindle their relationship and fulfil Giovanni\u2019s dream, of building a lodge on a plot of land high on the verdant flank of a mountain.Gorgeously photographed in a boxy academy ratio that emphasises the steep, breathlessly vertiginous angles of the landscape, this Italian-language and regional dialect production is an impressive first directing collaboration between Belgian husband-and-wife team Felix van Groeningen (The Broken Circle Breakdown, Beautiful Boy) and actress and writer Charlotte Vandermeersch. Sweeping and novelistic in scope, the film, adapted from an Italian bestseller by Paolo Cognetti, combines the earthy, rooted grit of Jack London with the vivid emotional landscapes of Elena Ferrante.","236":"While much of Marvel\u2019s output has rather blurred together of late into a gaudy onslaught of overplotted multiverse-hopping, the Guardians of the Galaxy movies have, for better or worse, always had a distinctive personality. What elevates Vol 3 (supposedly the final film in the GOTG series) is the way it keeps that personality, nodding to the irreverent swagger that is a crucial component of the Guardians USP while delivering a series of devastating emotional sucker punches along the way.To achieve this, director and co-writer James Gunn takes the fail-safe, heartstring-twanging route of placing adorable animals in peril, exploring Rocket the raccoon\u2019s traumatic backstory, and touching on some unexpectedly dark themes \u2013 eugenics and vivisection \u2013 in the process. There\u2019s a kinship with Bong Joon-ho\u2019s Okja: both pictures celebrate loyalty and friendship while also acknowledging humanity\u2019s capacity for unimaginable cruelty to other species.As a young, impossibly cute kit, Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) fell into the hands of the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji), a mad scientist with a God complex who believes that a perfect society starts in a macabre animal-testing laboratory. Rocket escaped, but in doing so he was separated from his soulmate, Lylla (Linda Cardellini), a pure-hearted otter with prosthetic metal arms. Now the High Evolutionary wants to recapture his most successful experimental subject, and he sends beautiful, gilt-edged dullard Adam Warlock (Will Poulter, great fun) to reclaim the raccoon.Classic rock needle drops and showy, snaking, single-shot action sequences \u2013 both GOTG trademarks \u2013 abound in a picture that balances a slightly overstuffed storyline with mischief, humour and the biggest of hearts.","237":"Whatever you feel toward the game director Hidetaka Miyazaki\u2019s fantasy oeuvre \u2013 Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Sekiro and Elden Ring, a constellation of hits often referred to as the \u201cSoulsborne\u201d set \u2013 the impact of his studio FromSoftware\u2019s work on the blockbuster video game industry is, with the arrival of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, indisputable. This most mainstream of brand-Disney endeavours has been shaped in ways both obvious and subtle by the gravitational force of Miyazaki\u2019s one-time niche designs.You play as Cal Kestis, a maverick Jedi unconcerned by the traditions of his order (you can dress Cal in any old scrubby T-shirt and cargo pants you collect in a remote treasure chest; no monkish robes here), who wields his lightsaber (also customisable) like a rapier. The rhythm of fights against droids, stormtroopers and 15ft rancors is moderated by participants\u2019 stamina, which drains with each strike, recuperating only in moments of retreat \u2013 a quintessential Miyazaki design. Health is restored at glowing meditation spots, places of sanctuary where ability points are spent expanding Cal\u2019s moves, but which also resurrect the local enemies.And soon enough you take over a derelict saloon, where you collect the friends you make on your journey (many of whom use their practical skills to repair and upgrade the cantina). The game\u2019s sweeping vistas are Tatooine filtered through Elden Ring, while Cal\u2019s ability to wall-run and hook-shot his way across the landscape with bungee ropes recalls Sekiro\u2019s ninja acrobatics. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is not the first theme-tribute to FromSoftware\u2019s work, but it\u2019s the most successful yet \u2013 a more accessible interpretation, certainly, but one that results in the finest Star Wars game in years, and shows how ideas from the fringes still have the power to reshape a medium.","238":"We\u2019re a week away from this year\u2019s Cannes film festival, and I\u2019m among those tensing with excitement. With new works from Martin Scorsese, Jonathan Glazer, Alice Rohrwacher and Todd Haynes, among others, it\u2019s a tasty lineup. Twenty-one films \u2013 seven by female directors, a record for the fest \u2013 are jostling for the Palme d\u2019Or, with reigning champion Ruben \u00d6stlund leading the jury to determine his successor.Arguably the most prestigious prize in world cinema, the Palme d\u2019Or nonetheless has a curious legacy. It is subject first to the biases of a festival selection committee that picks the annual handful of contenders, and second to the whims of nine celebrity jurors, who change every year. Though it has a loftier reputation than the best picture Oscar \u2013 with which it has only aligned twice in 75 years \u2013 it likewise has a history of eccentric calls: take 1986, for example, when Andrei Tarkovsky\u2019s shattering swansong The Sacrifice was pipped by Roland Joff\u00e9\u2019s starchy The Mission. David Lynch\u2019s Palme came for one of his most uneven films, Wild at Heart; David Cronenberg has never won one.Yet by occasional collision of good taste and good fortune, the prize has been bestowed on enough enduringly great films over the years that it retains its lustre. In its best years, it has even planted a flag for the new. 1967\u2019s win for Michelangelo Antonioni\u2019s sculptural, counterculture-influenced anti-mystery Blow-Up has aged very handsomely. Robert Altman\u2019s triumph for the randy, raucous antiwar comedy M*A*S*H a few years later was an early ratification of the New Hollywood movement. Later that decade, Francis Ford Coppola deservedly won twice for the ingeniously paranoid The Conversation (Paramount+) and the epically deranged Apocalypse Now. And when Martin Scorsese\u2019s haunted, post-Vietnam nightmare Taxi Driver took the Palme over the protests of that year\u2019s jury president, Tennessee Williams, the generational handover was confirmed.In 1989, a new wave of American independent cinema was announced when 26-year-old Steven Soderbergh won for his scuzzy, tangled relationship study Sex, Lies, and Videotape. In the mid-90s, Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Pulp Fiction landed the prize for meshing arthouse and hyperviolent B-movie tropes with such abandon that its imitators still abound today.Moving away from American cinema \u2013 as Cannes largely has of late, with no US film taking the Palme since Terrence Malick\u2019s glinting spiritual opus The Tree of Life 12 years ago \u2013 the prize has had equal success in recognising major international auteurs, from Italian Luchino Visconti\u2019s win for the grandiose sociopolitical swirl in The Leopard to, just three years ago, South Korea\u2019s Bong Joon-ho, with his wicked class-clash thriller Parasite.Kurosawa has one, for the ravishing samurai warfare of Kagemusha; so does Apichatpong Weerasethakul for his woozy reincarnation meditation Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives. Among my favourite Palme winners, Wim Wenders landed his for a wistful outsider\u2019s view of crushed American dreams in Paris, Texas, and Lars von Trier for a more violently expressive variation on that theme in his exhilarating experimental musical Dancer in the Dark (Amazon, Curzon). And while Britain has a healthy track record at Cannes, with Palmes for Ken Loach, Mike Leigh and Richard Lester among others, our finest hour at the festival might just be Lindsay Anderson winning for his volatile, still startling school rebellion drama If\u2026Most of these films have a prominent place in the canon, yet some of the greatest Palme d\u2019Or winners aren\u2019t as widely seen or screened. For years I put off watching Ermanno Olmi\u2019s The Tree of Wooden Clogs (Mubi), a three-hour portrait of a 19th-century peasant community, only to be entranced by its richly inhabited vigour and wit. After not being available online for some time, I was pleased to see that Japanese director Sh\u00f4hei Imamura\u2019s The Ballad of Narayama can now be streamed on Arrow. About the ritual abandonment of elders to die, it sounds forbidding but has a viscerally poetic payoff. Another happy find is Mikhail Kalatozov\u2019s The Cranes Are Flying, an intensely moving, humane study of a young Russian woman\u2019s emotional turmoil in wartime, available to stream for free on the official YouTube channel of its studio, Mosfilm.Would that all winners were so easy to access: Luis Bu\u00f1uel\u2019s extraordinary Viridiana and the only winner by an African film-maker, the Algerian war epic Chronicle of the Burning Years, are among those currently missing from the streaming realm. As for the 1966 winner, minor sex farce The Birds, the Bees and the Italians, suffice to say that a Palme d\u2019Or doesn\u2019t assure you a spot in the collective cultural memory.Enys Men (BFI) Speaking of Cannes, Cornish indie film-maker Mark Jenkin\u2019s latest premiered at last year\u2019s festival \u2013 and its cult of admirers are still chewing on the metaphysical, time-slipping folk horror puzzle it presents, in which the coastal landscape takes on an intangible aura of threat. Count me among those slightly disappointed, however: after the bracing authenticity of Jenkin\u2019s shoestring debut, Bait, this feels sleeker but less striking.Marcel the Shell With Shoes On (Universal; available 8 May) Nominated for this year\u2019s best animated feature Oscar, this hyper-whimsical stop-motion miniature from director Dean Fleischer Camp and comedian Jenny Slate was the clear hipsters\u2019 choice, with its mixture of arch mockumentary framing and cute underdog comedy about a plucky anthropomorphic seashell seeking his long-lost family. The twee factor is high but the execution is daintily clever.Honk for Jesus. Save Your Soul. (Universal) Perhaps unsurprisingly passed over for a cinema release in the UK, where the satirical target of American megachurches is less likely to resonate with audiences, this is a messy but often jaggedly funny tale of a southern Baptist pastor\u2019s wife attempting to rebuild a congregation in the wake of her husband\u2019s scandalous downfall. Regina Hall\u2019s gutsy, all-in performance holds it together.","239":"Lotfy Nathan has drawn from a deep well of sorrow and rage for this anguished drama, leading the audience to its horrible d\u00e9nouement like a trail of burning petrol: the title itself means \u201cburning\u201d (and also, ambiguously, escaping by boat). It is inspired by the story of Mohamed Bouazizi, the Tunisian street vendor who in 2011 ignited the Arab Spring (all too literally) by setting himself on fire outside the governor\u2019s office in the central Tunisian city of Sidi Bouzid \u2013 making it the uprising\u2019s Ground Zero \u2013 in protest against official corruption and the police who had beaten him when he could no longer pay their bribes.Adam Bessa plays Ali, a young guy who sells black-market petrol on a street corner, paying off hatchet-faced cops as he does so while dreaming of escaping across the Mediterranean to Europe for a better life. He is also pressured into doing more dangerous fuel smuggling at the border with Libya; Mahamat-Saleh Haroun\u2019s 2013 film GriGris also touches on Africa\u2019s illegal gasoline trade. We see Ali listening with resentful fascination to some blowhard in a local bar, boasting about how great it\u2019s been for him in Germany.But just as Ali\u2019s migrant dream looks like becoming a reality, his father dies, leaving him to look after his two younger sisters, Alyssa (Salima Maatoug) and school-age teen Sarra (Ikbal Harbi); he also discovers that his brother Skander (Khaled Brahem), who had previously been in charge of these siblings, is now leaving with his wife for a waiter job at a tourist cafe on the coast. And to top it all, Ali discovers that his father had bad debts and they are about to lose the house.Harka shows what triggers Ali most of all is visiting Skander at the resort and sensing the white vacationers\u2019 fear and contempt for him. He broods over the vastness of the sea: for tourists it is a luxury spectacle, for him the barrier to escape. It\u2019s a powerful movie and Bessa\u2019s performance is excellent. Harka is released on 5 May in UK cinemas.","240":"Isaac Julien presents 11 films at Tate Britain with a combined running time so voluminous you might want to make a day of it, with respite for lunch. They include a group of early works from the 1980s, screened on monitors and walls outside the exhibition, and seven multiscreen films in darkened theatres within. Copious seating, sumptuous carpets, ideal viewing ratios, barcodes that let you watch again later back home: everything has been arranged for your comfort.Which is worth bearing in mind as you witness the works of this inveterate seducer. Born in 1960, and starting out with experimental documentaries about police brutality, black life and culture in London, Julien found fame early on with Looking for Langston (1989). What he calls a \u201cmeditation\u201d on the ambiguously queer identity of the black US poet Langston Hughes set out the elements of his style: fact interspersed with fiction, documentary with drama, drifting dreamscapes with archive footage, montages of dance, song and monologue, the camera hovering on beautiful people and places.Acclaimed as the first art film made about the historical condition of being both black and gay, this cult work glitters on continuous loop at the heart of the show, and if you start here something particular starts to emerge. The film opens with an imaginary vision of Hughes\u2019s funeral, the deceased played by Julien himself, motionless against white drapes in a coffin. This is an art of commemoration.Here is A Marvellous Entanglement (2019), honouring the wild architecture of the Italian modernist Lina Bo Bardi, filmed across seven public buildings she designed for Brazil. Some are still in use, with their cave-mouth doors and windows and their curious cylinders of light. Others are derelict, and haunted by the spirit of the architect herself, played by two different women.They wander through her art museum, where the paintings project from resin bases like gravestones in a cemetery, down spiralling staircases, followed by dancers in descending flurries, through Bo Bardi\u2019s S\u00e3o Paulo theatre with its bare wooden seats. They give utterance to her strong opinions (against upholstery, in favour of mud), in particular her idea that time is not linear but \u201ca marvellous entanglement, where at any moment, points can be chosen and solutions invented, without beginning or end\u201d. Which might stand as the definition of Julien\u2019s own free-flowing films, which so studiously avoid mounting into narrative.There are other wraiths. A Regency dandy dances through the convoluted spaces of Sir John Soane\u2019s Museum, apparently observed only by a black curator (the voiceover is in Creole, as if Julien did not want you to comprehend). A famous performance by one of China\u2019s great silent movie stars, Ruan Lingyu, is reprised by the contemporary actor Zhao Tao in the streets of old Shanghai. The abolitionist and freedom fighter Frederick Douglass, played by Ray Fearon, gives a visionary lecture to an audience of Edinburgh Victorians, two of whom are moved to make their own protest in crinolines, while his second wife sits stitching a blue coat for him and his (abandoned) first wife sits pensively for a daguerreotype: the shadow of her existence caught on camera. That coat is cobalt, like his first wife\u2019s dress. A dancer whirls in flaring scarlet.The Chinese movie turns from monochrome into magenta, cerise, cerulean and lime. Julien\u2019s high interest in colour extends to the aspect of every single thing in every scene. His camera dwells on shimmering makeup, coiffed hair, buttons, stitches and velvet, on honed bodies and chiselled faces, bentwood furniture and the breeze lifting a gauzy blind. It slips in and out of The World of Interiors.Hot colours, languid imagery, the focus on showy details, all of it converges with the smooth movement of each film \u2013 gliding gradually through buildings, forests and cities, on trams, trains and slow boats. Occasionally, as in Ten Thousand Waves, partly shot on location in Shanghai Film Studios, it pans back to show the camera crews at work. This acknowledgment of the means of making goes straight to Julien\u2019s modus operandi: glossy, luxurious, swanky aesthetics made to carry a burden of theory.The latest work here is Once Again\u2026 (Statues Never Die), from 2022, commissioned and filmed at the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia. Andr\u00e9 Holland (of Moonlight fame) plays the black philosopher and theorist Alain Locke, who was unmistakably gay, and pursued the young Langston Hughes. Locke appears in dialogue with Albert Barnes (played by Danny Huston), debating the status of the African art Barnes bought for his collection in the 1920s, which \u201cis in danger of becoming a fashion or fad\u201d.Their conversation is intercut with footage from You Hide Me, a 1970 film shot by Ghanaian artist Nii Kwate Owoo in the British Museum stores arguing for the repatriation of the Benin bronzes. There are fragments of a 1953 Chris Marker film, extracts from Looking for Langston and a subplot in which Locke falls in love with the black artist Richmond Barth\u00e9. It all streams before you in coruscating black and white on five double-sided screens, themselves reflected in mirrors all around the gallery, and with a spectacular score and arias performed by the black singer Alice Smith. But still it remains a lecture swathed in silver-screen glamour.It is a risk, even in art film, to be so averse to narrative, pace or tension. Form and content sometimes seem so separate and inert in these works as to make you wonder what is even being attempted. Why is there a second actor playing Bo Bardi, when she mainly seems to repeat the first? Why is there such emphasis on the Scottish skies when Douglass pays his Edinburgh visit? Why does Julien suddenly show the Chinese goddess Mazu (Maggie Cheung), fabled for leading fishers to safety, being hauled back and forth in a harness against a green screen? It is the most atrocious bathos.The more so because this film is a requiem, of sorts, for the 23 Chinese cocklepickers who died in Morecambe Bay in 2004. An emergency phone call is played out over footage of terrifying tides. We hear intensely elegiac lines from the poet Wang Ping. But then we\u2019re straight back to cinematic old Shanghai. This is almost as tendentious as the stylised sequences in Julien\u2019s 2007 Western Union: Small Boats, where dancers were actually choreographed to play immigrants drowning during fatal Mediterranean crossings. There comes a point where Julien\u2019s \u201cpolitical lyricism\u201d, to borrow a phrase from Derek Jarman, gets uncomfortably close to slick mannerism.Isaac Julien: What Freedom Is to Me is at Tate Britain, London, until 20 August","241":"Like its subject, the heavyweight boxer turned preacher turned comeback champion boxer George Foreman (a physically transformed Khris Davis), this by-numbers biopic is hefty and powerful but not exactly light on its feet. The film is an uplifting plodder that takes in the boxer\u2019s formative years, in a desperately poor and fervently devout family in Houston, Texas; his encounter with the inspirational trainer (Forest Whitaker) who helped him channel his anger into sporting excellence; his reconnection with his faith; and his \u201cmiraculous\u201d late-life success.It\u2019s solidly and safely directed by George Tillman Jr, but will likely appeal more to the Christian cinema crowd than to the sports movie audience.Big George Foreman is out in cinemas in the UK now and in Australia on 20 July.","242":"Dalva (Zelda Samson) wears her honey-coloured hair in a soign\u00e9 updo; her wardrobe consists of little black cocktail dresses and lace. Which would be fine, except for the fact that Dalva is just 12 and has been shaped and brainwashed by her predatory paedophile father. At the very start of the film, in a harrowingly raw scene, the police and social services rescue Dalva from the home she shares with her abuser. Conditioned by her father to believe herself to be one half of a great love affair, Dalva pines and struggles to connect with the other kids in the residential home where she is placed.It\u2019s an uncomfortable watch, but this assured French-language debut from director Emmanuelle Nicot negotiates its disturbing subject matter with delicacy, sensitivity and honesty. In the central role, the magnetic Samson is a revelation.","243":"Adolescence is a messy place. Particularly so for girls such as Ria (Priya Kansara), who must negotiate the hostile territory of secondary school, grapple with emotions so intense they defy the laws of physics, and attempt to rescue her older sister Lena (Ritu Arya) from an impending marriage.The careering, erratic energy of this genre-hopping action fantasy from TV\u2019s We Are Lady Parts creator Nida Manzoor is designed to capture the fizzing chaos inside the mind of the average teenage girl. It makes a pretty good fist of it too, with aspiring stuntwoman Ria crashing like a wrecking ball through her own life and those of everyone around her. But for all the inventive excess and extravagant martial arts sequences (not for nothing did the film draw comparisons to Everything Everywhere All At Once after its debut at Sundance), there\u2019s a touch of children\u2019s TV special naivety in the execution.Still, the pinballing plot is constantly surprising, and both Kansara and Arya sparkle in this kickass celebration of sisterly bonds.","244":"Here is a meditative documentary from Dutch film-maker Joke Olthaar that mostly consists of monochrome, long-held static shots, exquisitely filmed by cinematographer Andr\u00e9 Schreuders, of the mountains in Triglav National Park in Slovenia. It opens and closes with some airy voiceover musings about the abyss, solitude and all that jazz, and there are references to \u201cthe three of us\u201d which chime with the three tiny, black, human-shaped blobs seen from time to time.But for the most part, there is no palpable story or shape to the film. Olthaar occasionally mixes in what looks like Super 8 footage of climbers and walkers pictured on a more human scale, and at one point a dead body is dug out of the snow. Yet none of that human activity is given any more weight than the shots of handsome goats hanging out on the crags, or the shifting patterns of sun and shadow flickering across the vast spaces.This is nature-based film-making taken to an almost abstract level, asking the viewer just to sit and contemplate the patterns of black, white and powdery grey that make up the mountainsides, majestic and terrifying all at once. The effect is so lulling and mesmeric that when the silence is suddenly pierced by the sound of a babbling brook of runoff water, it lands like a jump scare in a horror movie. Elsewhere there are sounds of the wind and a droning sort of background music composed by Rutger Zuydervelt that is reminiscent of the hums and crackles you might hear listening to BBC Radio 3\u2019s Night Tracks when you\u2019re falling asleep.This sort of thing is not going to be to everyone\u2019s taste but for lovers of minimalist cinema it will be a treat, especially if viewed in a cinema with proper sound and top-notch projection. Berg is released on 28 April in UK cinemas","245":"Financial analyst Max Stainton has cerebral palsy and is a wheelchair user \u2013 \u201cGive me a maths problem, I\u2019ll be fine. Don\u2019t ask me to put on my shirt,\u201d he quips \u2013 and director Carl Woods, in his debut documentary, follows Stainton on a two-week charity trek to Everest base camp on horseback. Horse riding is incredibly demanding physically for Stainton, and this film is not only a fly-on-the-wall adventure doc, but an insight into the frustrations of being disabled and constantly dealing with other people\u2019s stereotypes and assumptions.It begins at home in London where Stainton lives with his partner, Candy. Giggling, they describe meeting when she was hired as his PA, and they fancied each other like mad. (\u201cInappropriate!\u201d) Stainton explains that, with the trek, what he wants is to challenge society\u2019s perceptions, the pigeonholing of him as that guy in a wheelchair. \u201cTRAIN TRAIN TRAIN\u201d says a sticker on the fridge. So, he does endless crunches with his physiotherapist, and walks up and down the stairs in his block of flats.In the cold and altitude of Nepal, the trek turns out to be far more challenging than Stainton and his team anticipated. Candy, who admits that the Himalayas are not exactly her thing, struggles. For Stainton, the two weeks are physically painful and draining; on the toughest day he\u2019s kicked by the horse four times and ends up walking uphill for six hours.Reaching base camp is an incredible personal achievement but in the interview at home afterwards \u2013 which to be honest could have been more probing \u2013 Stainton evaluates the cost. The trip has left him more disabled and living with pain. He wonders if he\u2019s been judging his self-worth by other people\u2019s expectations too much. As Candy says, working with macho finance bros doesn\u2019t help. It feels like a bitter finish to the film, but then comes a lovely happy ending \u2013 spoiler alert! \u2013 of a wedding and a baby. My Everest is released on 28 April in UK cinemas.","246":"Here is a 1986 film co-directed by radical feminist film-maker Maureen Blackwood with artist-director Isaac Julien. Their sensibilities are a fruitful match here, creating a knotty, complex, self-questioning piece of work: drama, essay movie and video art crossover. Blackwood and Julien were drawing on the black power radicalism of the 60s and the feminism of the 80s in ways that could amount to a British new wave.In a stylised wilderness, a male and female figure confront each other ill-temperedly: the woman accusing the man of not allowing women any agency or space within the liberation movement. In a parallel realist drama, a family deals with racist abuse (often from off-duty police) and their own ideological and generational splits on the subject of injustice and empowerment, and how gay people of colour find themselves marginalised by the community from which they are hoping for support.Most striking in this movie are the extended montage sequences (the framing device being that these are the work of an art student): we see protests, demos and police confrontation which Blackwood and Julien have formed into a hypnotic and brilliant collage, tinting and grading the colour and adding a hip-hop soundtrack including the Aleem brothers. The effect is entirely absorbing; easily the most interesting and creative use of this kind of archive material I have ever seen. The Passion of Remembrance is released on 28 April in cinemas.","247":"With the far right on the up worldwide, it\u2019s getting late in the day to exhume the lessons of the mid-20th century. There are few surviving Holocaust perpetrators and victims still living, but this exemplary Austrian documentary, an attempt to chronicle the massacre of Hungarian Jews in the Danube river community of Hofamt Priel, does its damnedest to track down and understand both sides before they are gone.Director Hans Hochst\u00f6ger grew up in Hofamt Priel, a rural farming village about 100km west of Vienna, which was annexed to the larger town of Persenbeug. It was from a construction site on the river here that, on the night of 2 May 1945, the SS marched more than 200 refugees a short way inland and murdered them; an atrocity all the more senseless because the Nazis surrendered days later. Their remains, shoved into a ditch, were moved to a Jewish cemetery in 1964. But the killing was wilfully ignored and never investigated, unlike similar \u201cendphase\u201d incidents nearby, and only half-heartedly acknowledged in the form of a forlorn roadside memorial.Despite his calm narration, Hochst\u00f6ger is disturbed by the pall the massacre still casts over his home village. Starting with a neighbour \u2013 who was present in a house opposite as it unfolded, and evidently still haunted by it \u2013 he methodically pulls words out of this silence. Most eloquent, even in their lapses or having to let another complete their testimony, are three survivors: Marton and Zev Vilmos Klein, two brothers who escaped death with their family because they were doing forced labour in a Budapest factory; and Yakov Tibor Schwarz, who as an 11-year-old hid under straw at the construction site as the SS machine-gunned the infirm and child prisoners.Uncovering the killers is more difficult: evidence suggests that Persenbeug\u2019s mayor, a local doctor, a Nazi party member, and others collaborated with the SS. But they are long dead, and family members won\u2019t talk. There is one reckoning: a description of an improbable and shocking reprisal recounted in archive footage by Gy\u00f6rgy Roth, another relative of the dead. Given these pitiless trajectories, you can only thank heaven for the counterbalancing goodness also on evidence here, especially the family who hid Schwarz in the forest, and the local police chief who tried unsuccessfully to bring a prosecution. This is an austere, searing act of testimony. Endphase is available on True Story on 28 April.","248":"Here is a fiercely watchable thriller which had me biting my nails down to the wrists. It is inspired partly by Andreas Malm\u2019s radical eco-activist manifesto of the same title, and partly \u2013 in fact, almost pedantically \u2013 by the heist classic Reservoir Dogs. A young crew of protesters, each individually getting a backstory flashback which sometimes jumps into the drama at a cliffhanger moment, come together for the big job, knowing each other as little as Tarantino\u2019s colour-coded bad guys and having similar issues around gunshot wound injury and possible disloyalty.Director and co-screenwriter Daniel Goldhaber applies a fictional imagination to the first two words in the title of Malm\u2019s book, which argues for direct-action property destruction but is not actually a \u201chow to\u201d bomb-making guide like William Powell\u2019s 1971 gonzo classic The Anarchist Cookbook; it is still in print and still assuredly being studied by climate activists. Goldhaber\u2019s drama shows how this kind of paramilitary adventure might actually happen, month by month, moment by moment, as well as the kind of people who would be sufficiently motivated or reckless to risk decades in federal prison. They are all drawn together by a plan to blow up a west Texas oil pipeline, disrupt the flow and drive its price ruinously up.Interestingly, there is no clear leader, no one whose job is to explain to the gang (and the audience) what is going to happen, in scenes which would involve them standing in front of a whiteboard or a table with toy cars around a cardboard model. In so far as someone is in charge, it appears to be Michael (Forrest Goodluck), a bomb specialist: although the lightbulb moment of having the idea and finding the exact spot where a bomb could be planted are relatively unimportant and almost invisible.Michael is a young Native American who resents the oil rigs destroying his homeland; Xochitl (Ariela Barer) and Theo (Sasha Lane, from Andrea Arnold\u2019s American Honey) are friends affected by big oil\u2019s toxic pollution in their neighbourhood, and Theo\u2019s girlfriend Alisha (Jayme Lawson) agrees to help. Dwayne (Jake Weary) is a Texan good ol\u2019 boy and open-carry gun enthusiast who resents the government requisitioning his land, Shawn (Marcus Scribner) is disillusioned with the virtue-signalling futility of making documentary films about climate change, and Logan (Lukas Gage) and Rowan (Kristine Froseth) are seasoned campaigners.A regular heist movie is driven by cynicism and greed, undercut with a crime-doesn\u2019t-pay anxiety; this film is therefore fundamentally unlike Tarantino\u2019s, but it is also unlike say, Gillo Pontecorvo\u2019s The Battle of Algiers from 1966 which shows the insurgents\u2019 revolutionary motivation sympathetically, but without overtly asking the audience to share it. Another comparison might be Fred Zinnemann\u2019s 1973 adaptation of Frederick Forsyth\u2019s novel The Day of the Jackal, which presented us with the hitman\u2019s thrillingly ice-cold professionalism in the (paid) service of a cause. Here, the pipeline destroyers are the good guys; an interesting genre twist though one which arguably defangs the film, just a little, removing the addictive flavour of cruelty and chaos, yet not making it any the less gripping and ingenious. How to Blow Up a Pipeline is released on 21 April in UK and Irish cinemas.","249":"Irish film-maker and journalist Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Shea has a gripping and inspirational story to tell about her home town of Navan in Co Meath, and she tells it terrifically well, talking to the people involved, engaging with the history, delivering the drama and teasing out the poignancies and complexities.O\u2019Shea is speaking to the people who stood up to church abuse in the 60s and 70s, at a time when challenging the Catholic authorities seemed unthinkable. There can hardly be anyone left now who doesn\u2019t know something about Ireland\u2019s coming to terms with the historical abuse sanctioned by the church and its treatment of young pregnant women in the brutal mother-and-baby houses and Magdalene Laundries, the subject of movies such as Stephen Frears\u2019s Philomena and Peter Mullan\u2019s The Magdalene Sisters. These were the workhouses of shame, or perhaps the refineries in which guilt and fear were extracted as fuel for the theocracy. Schools were the same, with their incessant beatings, carried out by unmarried men who had of course been beaten and humiliated themselves in their formative years: a theatre of cruelty where the punishment was the point. (England has nothing to be smug about: we had teachers routinely assaulting children in front of other children for reasons they perhaps couldn\u2019t explain to themselves.)O\u2019Shea returns to the nightmare of the dead infants buried in secret in the mother-and-baby house grounds; she shows that it was the result of callousness and incompetence but also something even more sinister; not all the babies could be adopted, the authorities had no great enthusiasm for maintaining embarrassing hordes of growing infants and they were frankly content for the horror and grief of infant mortality to be part of the young women\u2019s punishment.But in Navan, some stood up against it all. O\u2019Shea talks to Dr Mary Randles, who with her (now late) husband Dr Paddy Randles established in Navan the first family planning clinic in Ireland outside Dublin, and complained directly to the school when a young boy, Norman Murray, was viciously beaten simply for using his left hand to write, after his right arm was broken in a fall. Murray is interviewed here, and his dignity, courage and humility are moving, like all the other interviewees \u2013 particularly the women who were forced into these institutions, but whose babies were amazingly returned to them due to the Randles\u2019 fearless intervention.When the authorities contemptuously rejected Randles\u2019 complaint about corporal punishment, she tried taking the story to the Irish newspapers who refused to touch it. Finally the British News of the World ran the story in two parts, followed by America\u2019s NBC News. But no one in Navan saw the TV item and as for the News of the World, the legend is that priests made sure that no copies carrying the second half were carried in Navan newsagents.This was all almost certainly done with the connivance of, or even under instruction from, Navan\u2019s dynamic and much-admired priest, Father Andy Farrell, a man with the charisma of a young John F Kennedy. Farrell was in some ways a progressive figure who talked passionately about Christianity as socialism in action. But he was also a reactionary in sexual politics, colluding with the mother-and-baby racket, although very possibly with a heavy heart. O\u2019Shea\u2019s film concludes with a thoughtful, nuanced assessment of this important figure.Corporal punishment was finally outlawed in 1982, though the laundries continued in dwindling forms for many years afterwards. The nation of Ireland is vastly different now, but O\u2019Shea shows this change was not inevitable, but the effect of courageous dissidents. Pray for Our Sinners is released on 21 April in Irish cinemas, and on Curzon Home Cinema.","250":"British indie director Jon Sanders creates another of his low-key, thoughtful movies developed through improvisation; it is a static, eccentric chamber piece in some ways, but engaging and pregnant with ideas about mourning and grief. Josie Lawrence and Tanya Myers play Dot and Phoebe, two sisters who have come to the seaside home of their late mother, a singer and entertainer, to confront the daunting task of sorting out all her belongings and theatrical memorabilia.This opens up painful memories and psychic wounds: however much they loved her, their mother was serially unfaithful to their father \u2013 once with a boyfriend of Phoebe\u2019s \u2013 and now they don\u2019t know how to feel. These themes of sexual transgression are strangely echoed in the present action, as if the women\u2019s mother is haunting the property. Their friend Monica (Anna Mottram) who has come to help them, is attracted to Tom (James Northcote), a young man who has been housesitting the property; she feels guilty about her husband, an excellent cameo from the late Bob Goody.It is difficult to know exactly what to make of A Clever Woman, but this is because Sanders is a very nonconformist film-maker, and his film does not match up to expected genres, expected narratives, expected characters. It doesn\u2019t even resemble the kind of social realism that tends to get public funding, being unfashionably about the just-about-managing British middle classes. With its long takes, its melancholy evocation of theatre and quiet unhappiness, the film is almost Bergmanesque: but really too briskly comic for that comparison to be accurate.In some ways, Sanders is pursuing a kind of hyperlocal cinema, a cinema that follows its nose to various ideas and situations and then away from them. It\u2019s a confident, controlled piece of work which gives us a sliver of Englishness. A Clever Woman is released on 21 April in UK cinemas.","251":"Apparently, the new arthouse flex is dropping your opening credits half an hour or more into the film, as in Drive My Car, Long Day\u2019s Journey Into Night \u2013 and now Aly Muritiba\u2019s desolate and sophisticated Brazilian romantic quest Private Desert. Here, it\u2019s all the better to accentuate the barren terrain from which it emerges. Brawny police instructor Daniel (Bacurau\u2019s Antonio Saboia) is suspended for attacking a recruit and forced to take on punishing night shifts as a security guard. At home he battles to convince his sister to do her fair share of caring for their dementia-stricken father, also a former policeman. Daniel\u2019s only succour is the WhatsApp-based relationship he has with Sara, a woman somewhere in Brazil\u2019s north. Then she starts ghosting him.Prologue done, Daniel snaps and hits the road in search of his Awol paramour. He flyposts the area near the inland city of Petrolina with shots of Sara. But when they finally cross paths under nightclub lights, she turns out not to be who she says. There is a change of styles from the intro\u2019s sepulchral tableaus to something more loose and fluid, and Muritiba excels at infusing his drama with subtle state-of-the-nation resonance. There seem to be two Brazils, circling but constantly misunderstanding one another. Daniel \u2013 making jokes as his father puts his \u201cpistol\u201d away as he washes him \u2013 is in hock to sclerotic macho ideals. But are things any less unhappy elsewhere? The people around Sara \u2013 like Fernando (Thomas Aquino), the protective friend who screens Daniel \u2013 spin out exploitative fantasies but remain dependent on and defined by those whom they feed off.The romantic tussle rests on two astute performances. Saboia allows a kind of bug-eyed unease to dominate Daniel, despite his attempts at dick pic-taking insouciance. And, as his opposite number, Pedro Fasanaro cycles through disaffection, self-infatuation and an earnest search for self which is as urgent as the smitten copper\u2019s. Perhaps there is something a bit too demonstrative about the eventual resolution, wrapped with the bow of the Bonnie Tyler belter Total Eclipse of the Heart. But Private Desert winds up somewhere surprisingly gentle. Private Desert is available on digital platforms on 24 April","252":"Garlic bulbs at the ready for Chris McKay\u2019s horror-comedy: a cynical side-hustle of a picture, come to drain the extremities of the Bram Stoker estate and install a lowly pretender as king. As embodied by Nicholas Hoult, foppish Renfield wouldn\u2019t look out of place in a genteel period romance. Instead, he\u2019s spent the past century as Dracula\u2019s grotesque familiar, gobbling insects for breakfast and sourcing new meat for his master. \u201cA busload of cheerleaders,\u201d demands the count at one point, as though he\u2019s perusing the menu at his favourite bistro.Every generation, perhaps, gets the monster movie it deserves. This one practically bounces off the analyst\u2019s couch, spouting the language of trauma, recovery and self-empowerment. Attending a support group, Renfield learns that he\u2019s in a \u201ccodependent relationship\u201d with a toxic narcissist and duly tries to strike out on his own, fighting big-city crime alongside Awkwafina\u2019s lone honest cop. This, one assumes, is his big redemption arc, although in practice it chiefly involves indiscriminate comic-book slaughter. Limbs are lopped off. Heads explode like bombs. McKay gives us gallons of blood. Not much of it is fresh.The film\u2019s most lively inhabitant, ironically enough, is Dracula himself, Renfield\u2019s outraged boss. He\u2019s played with a knowing gusto by Nicolas Cage, who appears to have reached the point in his career where he is essentially called on to play the role of Nic Cage. Here, he provides some fabulous B-movie fireworks, sporadically channelling the spirit of Bela Lugosi and making the most of his scant screen time. Your standard vampire film would have put Cage centre stage. Renfield, God help it, elects to bury the lede and drive a stake through his heart.","253":"Here is a standalone feature film and final capstone in Netflix\u2019s British-made TV series The Last Kingdom, an epic in every sense of the word that\u2019s based on novels by Bernard Cornwell and unfolds in the 10th century, just before the Norman invasion. Even if you\u2019ve never seen a single episode from any of the show\u2019s previous five seasons of dramatised yet highly researched British history, you\u2019ll probably quite like to go back and start watching the whole saga from the beginning because it gets more gripping the more you surrender to it. This is largely down to the thoughtful way it tries to present a society composed of pagan Danes and Christian Saxons \u2013 and folks who are a bit of both \u2013 trying with some difficulty to all get along.The main dude is one such mixed-heritage chap named Uhtred (Alexander Dreymon), who apparently was born a Saxon but raised by Vikings and believes in the Norse gods. A fearsome warrior wielding a sword with a chunk of amber on the hilt, and a mane of tangled hair shaved at the sides so he looks like a new age traveller from the 1990s, Uhtred is the leader of a community in Northumbria, eschewing the title king. His alliance with the royal family of Wessex to the south is tested when newly crowned King Aethelstan (Harry Gilby) comes to power and is persuaded by his closest adviser Ingilmundr (Laurie Davidson) (a fanatical convert to Christianity) to use this moment to seize control of all Britain\u2019s kingdoms, from the Shetland and Orkney islands to Wessex. There are, as the title might imply, eight kings in all, but the wife of a friend of Uhtred\u2019s with a history of making prophecies foretells that seven of them will die.There\u2019s a ton of plot crammed tightly into the running time, but director Edward Bazalgette manages the storytelling efficiently, helped by the display of place names at the beginning of each scene explaining which castle we\u2019re at now, as well as how it was known in 900-something, and the name it goes by now. If you like that kind of nerdy attention to detail, you will love this \u2013 the saga must be essential viewing for Larp enthusiasts and battle recreators. But, Bazalgette and the film never wink at us, and try to stay true to the mindset of the times, from self-hating gay men who try to purge the \u201csins\u201d they fear they\u2019ve committed by waging war for Christianity, to the way Dark Age folks treated women and conquered enemies with about an equal amount of contempt. The battle scenes are not quite on the scale of the Lord of the Rings or Game of Thrones franchises, but they are pretty spicy and well staged for something that clearly has a far smaller budget. The Last Kingdom: Seven Kings Must Die is released on 14 April on Netflix.","254":"No matter how many times I see it, I know its hardest punch is coming at the very end and I am helplessly leading with my chin. Director Martin Scorsese flashes up a quotation from John 9:24-26, its verses individually illuminated in succession: \u201cSo for the second time, the Pharisees summoned the man who had been blind and said: \/ \u2018Speak the truth before God. We know this fellow is a sinner.\u2019 \/ \u2018Whether or not he is a sinner, I do not know,\u2019 the man replied \/ \u2018All I know is this: once I was blind and now I can see.\u2019\u201dBut has redemption really finally come for Jake LaMotta \u2013 the corrupt, self-hating, self-sabotaging and not especially repentant boxer so unforgettably played by Robert De Niro in Scorsese\u2019s 1980 classic Raging Bull, incandescent with monochrome beauty. LaMotta ends his days without reconciliation with his wife whom he abused, without reconciliation with his longsuffering brother Joey (an equally unforgettable performance from Joe Pesci). The final act comes with his blandly sentimental, self-congratulatory nightclub act in which this bloated, ruined figure is simply pleased to have survived, as uninterested in moral judgment as the blind man who refuses to condemn Jesus.Perhaps that is the mystery of Raging Bull: its equivalent of divine grace. The boxing movie is traditionally about redemption and the comeback of the underdog; just the year before, Stallone\u2019s Rocky II \u2013 produced, like Ragjng Bull, by Irwin Winkler \u2013 told just this kind of story. But Raging Bull was a more brutally nihilist tale, its subject a brawling, misogynist fighter who took a dive for the short end money (like Brando in On the Waterfront), whose championship win was hopelessly compromised by mob corruption, whose decline was marked by ingratitude and abuse, and who finally becomes a caged monster punching the wall with despair. (Moviegoers at the time sensed an echo with David Lynch\u2019s The Elephant Man.) And all this is shown in a stunning, dreamlike series of episodes in and out of the ring, as LaMotta fanatically squares up to various opponents, has head-butting encounters with Joey, falls in love with his second wife, Vickie, (Cathy Moriarty) \u2013 and comes to hate her, driven mad by his own possessive fear and insecurity and brought down by his own toxic machismo.As well as being based on LaMotta\u2019s autobiography, Scorsese\u2019s film took inspiration from Mark Robson\u2019s Champion (1949) with Kirk Douglas, and Jean-Pierre Melville\u2019s Magnet of Doom (1963) with Jean-Paul Belmondo. But the sheer brio and kinetic energy of those nightmarish boxing scenes are utterly unique, like no boxing movie before or since. Maybe the sport itself was outclassed by this film\u2019s despairing beauty.The \u201cdive\u201d scene is at the very centre of the film\u2019s meaning. LaMotta, like so many fighters before him, has to deliberately throw a fight so that the mob grandees, who have bet heavily on his unfancied opponent at long odds, will win big and reward him with a shot at the title. But it is a desperately risky business: the promised title shot may not materialise and his career momentum might stall, ending in the Palookaville of defeat: which is of course Brando\u2019s sad fate in On the Waterfront. De Niro shows how LaMotta\u2019s pride will not let him lose convincingly; he can\u2019t and won\u2019t go down. The crowd jeers at this obvious corruption and in his dressing room LaMotta bursts into tears like a little boy. But that is the point: in the emotional ritual of abuse, LaMotta has to be humiliated, mutilated like a gelding, shown who\u2019s boss, and bend the knee to his mob bosses. This is masculinity\u2019s theatre of cruelty.When I first saw Raging Bull, I came out of the cinema simultaneously exhausted and yet supercharged with energy, as if I could throw buses across the street. It still makes me feel like that. Raging Bull is released on 14 April in UK cinemas, and screening now in select Australian cinemas.","255":"Some films don\u2019t globetrot so much as globelurch, steered by creatives going wild on Expedia after a heavy night on the Kestrel. Pinging haphazardly and often nonsensically around central and eastern Europe, this trashy runaround sees French action specialist Camille Delamarre (Brick Mansions, The Transporter Refuelled) emerging from sometime mentor Luc Besson\u2019s shadow, for better or worse. Liberated from Besson\u2019s more questionable fetishes but also untethered from a healthy line of credit, the result never rises above generic multiplex filler. Everyone is travelling economy, with a tatty script stuffed way down, out of shame, in their carry-on luggage.After doing for an assailant who attacks him and his schoolmarm girlfriend, nice-guy assassin Morgan (Henry Golding) learns he\u2019s been unknowingly entered in effectively a hitpersons\u2019 Champions League. On the plus side, it provides the perfect opportunity to deploy the improbably wide-ranging personal surveillance network he maintains from his shabby digs. Sam Neill is Morgan\u2019s urbane handler, found tickling the harpsichord at one point; Noomi Rapace occupies a botched dual role, requiring her to alternate between big specs as the head of some security agency and blond frosting as the most vicious of Morgan\u2019s rivals. The casting is simpler elsewhere: grizzled ex-doormen abound.The action is functional enough, even as it abides by combat principles worn out by the later Bourne movies. The obvious limitation is that Delamarre remains baffled by any scene that doesn\u2019t involve guns, cars or fisticuffs; his best guess is to screw in eight gaudy lightbulbs, go handheld and hope his actors can rescue him. They, however, are preoccupied with some of the most leaden dialogue ever transmitted in Dolby surround. No attention whatsoever has been paid to the detail: the fingers severed to confirm kills have all the solidity of Percy Pigs, while one website headline looks like it was knocked out on the Notes app 30 seconds before camera rolled. Appreciation for the artistry of the John Wick series redoubles frame by crummy frame. Assassin Club is released on 14 April in cinemas.","256":"Harshness is transformed into beauty and then terror by this extraordinary film from Icelandic director Hlynur P\u00e1lmason about a 19th-century Danish pastor sent to establish a new church on Iceland\u2019s remote south-eastern coast. I left the cinema dazed and elated by its artistry; it is breathtaking in its epic scale, magnificent in its comprehension of landscape, piercingly uncomfortable in its human intimacy and severity. There is such superb compositional sense in the still life tableau shots and the almost archaeological sense of time, creating something deeply mysterious and unbearably sad. There are echoes of Werner Herzog\u2019s Aguirre, the Wrath of God, Roland Joff\u00e9\u2019s The Mission, Lisandro Alonso\u2019s Jauja \u2013 and even Howard Hawks\u2019s Red River.P\u00e1lmason announces in the opening credits that the story was inspired by the supposed discovery in Iceland of seven glass-plate photographs of people and places taken there at the end of the 19th century. While the claim is a deadpan fiction, his screen has an almost square 1.33:1 aspect ratio, perhaps in honour of the still photograph motif. This smaller-size, in such contradistinction to the movie\u2019s CinemaScope ambition and spectacle, gives a density to the viewing experience.Elliott Crosset Hove plays Lucas, a highly-strung young clergyman instructed by his bishop to travel to a pioneer community in Iceland (then a Danish dependency), superintend the church-building and install himself as parish priest. Lucas makes this arduous journey first by sea and then overland with horses, taking among his luggage a huge and burdensome cross, climbing mountains and fording rivers with it. But Lucas has a secular-ethnographic project to go with the imperial Christian mission: he dreams of taking the first pictures there, capturing the people with new technology. His cumbersome tripod goes on his back, its three spiked feet poking up behind his head, a version of the points of a crucifix. The camera is Lucas\u2019s ordeal as he visits his stations of the cross.Driven to the edge of madness by hardship and physical pain, Lucas has a thwarted friendship \u2013 or something more \u2013 with his translator (Hilmar Gudj\u00f3nsson), and finally finds an erotic connection with Anna (Vic Carmen Sonne), the daughter of the local parishioner, who takes him in. But his life is dominated by his cantankerous, contemptuous Icelandic guide Ragnar, a tough, weatherbeaten veteran tremendously played by Ingvar Sigurdsson, the cop from P\u00e1lmason\u2019s previous film A White, White Day. Palmas\u00f3n shows that Lucas is humanised and possibly even redeemed by his encounters at journey\u2019s end, particularly his relationship with his quasi-host, the level-headed widower Carl (a shrewdly judged performance from Jacob Lohmann), who is bemused by Lucas\u2019s self-harming decision to come to Iceland in the most difficult way possible, and then suspicious of his potential designs on his eldest daughter. Anna\u2019s younger sister Ida (\u00cdda Mekk\u00edn Hlynsd\u00f3ttir) has an attractively emollient role and her relationship with Lucas is gentle and sweet and brings out the nearest Lucas has to warmth.The film\u2019s mightiest figure is the implacable Ragnar. Far from helping Lucas across the terrain, Ragnar embodies it; he is the very personification of its hostility. As an Icelander, he hates the high-handed Dane with his book-learning. Lucas comes in turn to hate and fear him. And yet P\u00e1lmason shows that Ragnar softens imperceptibly even as he sabotages Lucas; he needs someone to confess his terror of God to while exorcising a lifetime of buried rage. In Godland, these emotions are projected out on to the stunning, daunting landscape to the accompaniment of spine-meltingly beautiful choral music. That austere, boxy screen looks like a window on to a vast, unfathomable world. Godland is released on 7 April in cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema.","257":"When Richard Donner\u2019s Superman was first released in 1978, getting audiences to believe a man could fly didn\u2019t just mean state-of-the-art special effects \u2013 and these don\u2019t hold up too badly even now. It meant convincing them that superhero films were worthwhile in the first place; it meant event-movie seriousness, a great John Williams score and opening intergalactic credits that were a little like the recent smash Star Wars; it meant Hollywood grandeur and acting nobility, a film that began looking like a weighty action thriller with substantial comedy moments, a disaster movie, or rather averted-disaster movie, giving us a tremendous shot of the San Andreas fault opening up, and a supernatural time-travel drama.Superman is a very 1970s New York film, with some great, bustling streetscape scenes, and the film is shot and lit in a familiar realist way quite different from the hard, flat, unreal colour and production design of Marvel or DC films now. It was the great origin myth movie, the origin myth for superhero movies themselves, the product that now dominates cinema. And for this film, the \u201cextended universe\u201d was the actual universe, our universe: a standalone drama with Superman at its centre, and bad guys lined up ready to be fought.Mario Puzo claimed he was paid a million dollars simply for drafting a page-long story synopsis; a snowy-haired, Shakespearean-voiced Marlon Brando plays the Man of Steel\u2019s tragic father Jor-El who warns his home planet Krypton of the impending climate crisis, in vain. Susannah York is his all-but silent mother \u2013 and no less a figure than Trevor Howard plays one of the Krypton worthies who ignores the warning. Jor-El\u2019s baby is dispatched to our human planet, crashing to Earth in the farm belt in 1938. His teen angst years are given short shrift and after a kind of quasi-timeless existential coming-of-age in the icy Fortress of Solitude, he is somehow given his famous costume and moves to Metropolis in 1978 as mild-mannered reporter Clark Kent.And so begins the most famous example of UST, or Unresolved Sexual Tension, in screenwriting history: endlessly flirting with reporter Lois Lane (Margot Kidder), a smoker of Marlboro cigarettes who after a date-slash-exclusive-interview wonderingly gives him his name: \u201cWhat a super man \u2026 Superman!\u201d So nothing to do with Nietzsche. Gene Hackman is a tremendous Lex Luthor: the wisecracking villain and acting heavyweight that Superman deserved.Christopher Reeve endowed Superman\/Clark with a goofy seriousness and reticent, gentlemanly charm, a family movie hero quite different and more mature than the sleeker, cooler, younger figure that pretty much everyone since has tried to portray; Reeve dons a big and unsexy pair of glasses to match those worn by snooker legend Dennis Taylor. The actor\u2019s own catastrophic accident in 1995, which resulted in him becoming a wheelchair user, gave the likable Reeve his own poignantly mythic, extratextual part of the Superman legend.This Superman alludes explicitly to its origins in the Depression-era comics, and Clark has a quaint 30s habit of using the phrase \u201cSwell!\u201d from his boyhood. Maybe now this movie looks quaint in the same way. But there\u2019s still a surge of adventure and fun. Superman is released on 7 April in cinemas.","258":"Old warhorse Jackie Chan, who still has a heap of movies in development, doesn\u2019t look ready for the knacker\u2019s yard quite yet. But that\u2019s not the impression given by this valedictory-seeming and downright maudlin family action film, with its refrain of \u201cJumping down is easy, stepping down is hard\u201d. Playing a one-time master Hong Kong stuntman who has been laid low by injury, Chan is seen watching reels of his classic spills \u2013 including the iconic Police Story shopping mall plunge \u2013 with all the misty-eyed reverence of Cinema Paradiso.Ride On lays it on doubly thick: not only is Master Luo (Chan) partnered with Red Hare, a cute horse who all but talks, he is also rebuilding his relationship with estranged daughter Bao (Liu Haocun). Scraping a living by giving rides in comedy outfits to tourists outside movie studios, Luo and Red Hare are called back to stunt work when video of them tag-teaming some local debt collectors hits social media. Bao, still resentful of her dad for prioritising his career, agrees to become his agent. But the comeback is threatened when a pair of corporate goons turn up to auction off Red Hare, apparently someone else\u2019s property.The 68-year-old Chan slips down off Red Hare like a limber teenager. But horse aside, he largely retreads old ground here, with a handful of shambolic dustups that, apart from the enterprising use of a wicker rocking chair, are pretty standard Jackie. Only one kung fu set piece really stands out: Luo and sidekick triumphantly face off against an axe-wielding horde for the movie cameras. Red Hare batters a thug-filled tram car with titanic kicks that make human performers, Chan included, look like chicken-legged weaklings.Bao\u2019s lawyer boyfriend (Guo Qilin) offers a way out of the bailiff predicament, with the bumbling suitor opening up some old-school social farce, including a callback to Drunken Master\u2019s training sequence. But this plotline and the drawn-out, drippy reconciliation with Bao are non-starters. It\u2019s all there as dressing, along with a late appearance from current Chinese box-office don Wu Jing, for an overlong ceremonial send-off for Chan and the rough\u2019n\u2019tumble Hong Kong tradition. Chan has accrued so much goodwill, though, it\u2019s hard not to be tearjerked into submission \u2013 especially with his sentimental proxy Red Hare cranking up the hankie count. When Chan finally does retire, we\u2019ll all need our own emotional support animal. Ride On is released in cinemas on 7 April.","259":"This is the second movie in Krzystztof Kie\u015blowski\u2019s great Colours trilogy, now on rerelease; here white is the colour of death, the colour of winter, the colour of orgasm (a climactic, screen-filling flash of pleasure) and also the colour of a clean slate and a fresh start about to be muddied and spoiled. Theoretically, it addresses not just the middle colour of the French flag, but the second tenet of the revolution as well \u2013 equality \u2013 which it does by dramatising some outrageous inequality. It also satirises the specious new equality and meritocracy of gangster capitalism, on the rise in post-Soviet Poland.Working again with composer Zbigniew Preisner, Kie\u015blowski audaciously jolts the tone away from the dreamy, tragic and cosmic loneliness of Blue (whose protagonist, Juliette Binoche, is glimpsed again here) to a vinegary black comedy of marital breakdown, poverty and immigrant anxiety; it also contains one of the biggest, bleakest laugh lines in European cinema. Karol, the poverty-stricken Polish hairdresser in Paris has no money or passport, and finds he can only get back to Poland by stowing away in a trunk belonging to a Polish acquaintance. In Warsaw, this expensive-looking trunk is stolen by crooked baggage handlers who are furious to find only a homeless man inside. After being savagely beaten, Karol looks around at a snowy-white rubbish dump and gasps: \u201cHome at last!\u201d No one could accuse Kie\u015blowski of romanticising his homeland.Zbigniew Zamachowski plays Karol; his marriage to Dominique, acted with glacial hauteur by Julie Delpy, has ended in divorce due to non-consummation, with Karol\u2019s erectile dysfunction mirroring the dysfunction all around him. Apparently exploiting her advantage as a French citizen against the alien Pole, Dominique vengefully freezes their bank account and even torches their hair salon, threatening to blame the arson on him. Hapless Karol is befriended by a lugubrious and melancholy fellow Pole, Miko\u0142aj (Janusz Gajos) who leads him back to Poland and makes him a bizarre financial offer to get him back on his feet.Back in the old country, Karol finds himself working for black market money-changers. He gets wind of western corporations intending to buy up valueless land thereabouts, moves like lightning to buy the land with Mikolaj\u2019s cash and becomes a slick-haired capitalist himself, all the time dreaming of one day proving himself to Dominique with his new financial virility.It\u2019s an almost Jonsonian parable of an upwardly mobile hero with a downwardly mobile view on life: busking in the Paris metro, stowing away in luggage in the hold of a plane and becoming a shark-like entrepreneur wheeling and dealing in the new Polish business environment. Zamachowski\u2019s sad, boyish performance is a droll counterpart to the worldly Miko\u0142aj, a mysterious professional card player, wonderfully played by stage veteran Gajos. As for Dominique, it is a bit of a two-dimensional role (certainly compared to Binoche\u2019s in the previous picture) and a rather male conception of villainous sexiness, but Delpy carries it off with panache.What a strange confection White is \u2013 an opera of male agony and outrageously implausible picaresque adventure. Yet it succeeds amazingly on its own melodramatic terms.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotion Three Colours White is released on 7 April in cinemas.","260":"Well, this is refreshing. Dungeons & Dragons: Honour Among Thieves is that vanishingly rare entity \u2013 a riotously entertaining family-friendly film that hasn\u2019t been painfully squeezed out of a comic-book franchise like the last, forlorn dregs of toothpaste from a long-dead tube. Admittedly, this isn\u2019t the first film to be based on the enduringly popular fantasy role-playing game \u2013 Jeremy Irons starred in a critically reviled version in 2000; a made-for-TV sequel and direct-to-DVD third instalment followed. But Honour Among Thieves is more than a reboot \u2013 it\u2019s a fleshed-out, multidimensional piece of world-building, with immediately likable characters, plenty of face-crunching, axe-based fight choreography and a running joke about potatoes.Kudos to John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein, who co-wrote and co-directed the picture. As a creative partnership, they have experience in reboots \u2013 they co-wrote Spider-Man: Homecoming \u2013 and board games, having co-directed the comedy thriller Game Night. With this picture, they strike a satisfying balance between character and action, and ensure that the digital effects are in service of the story, rather than the other way around.It also helps that the film is exceptionally well cast. Chris Pine\u2019s charm has never been more slippery as incorrigible thief Edgin and Michelle Rodriguez brings formidable action chops to Edgin\u2019s partner in crime Holga. Bridgerton\u2019s Reg\u00e9-Jean Page bags the best lines and much of the action as Xenk. And then there\u2019s Hugh Grant, whose roguish conman Forge bears more than a passing resemblance to his Phoenix Buchanan in Paddington 2. But when the film is this much fun, who cares if Grant recycles some of the greatest hits from his gag repertoire?","261":"German filmmaker Jens Meurer has had a huge success in his native land with this vivid and richly affectionate anglophile documentary. I think I can see why, and it could even turn into a German national TV tradition \u2013 like Dinner for One, the English-language drawing room comedy sketch that the Germans love watching at Christmas. Could it be that a German documentary about an English seaside town will show us all the way ahead, and heal the psychic wounds of Brexit?Seaside Special is all about Cromer on the north Norfolk coast in the distant summer of 2019 \u2013 and mostly about all the local people preparing to take part in the annual end-of-the-pier show, the last of its kind in the UK, or for that matter the world. This theatrical event itself looks like a terrifically enjoyable variety gang show: with naughty gags, brassy musical numbers, Hollywood homages and pop songs. It is a bit like the BBC\u2019s 70s programme Seaside Special (does Meurer really know about that?) or the old kids\u2019 TV show Crackerjack.Cromer, as Meurer\u2019s film is quick to tell us, was overwhelmingly for Brexit but, interestingly, the tone of his film isn\u2019t condescending or derogatory \u2013 perhaps because, to Germans, the leavers and the remainers both look like wacky Pythonesque British eccentrics. Meurer interviews leavers includer a fisher who we see bobbing thoughtfully about in his boat, just next to the pier, explaining why he\u2019s against the EU. Then we talk to some of the showbusiness folk who are broadly in favour of staying. But they have no ill-will towards neighbours who feel differently. People talk animatedly about feeling European and also feeling British, and it doesn\u2019t occur to anyone to start a fight about it.There is always a kind of rackety glamour and melancholy in the end-of-the-pier idea, and at times this reminds me, just a bit, of Ken Russell\u2019s The Boy Friend. I suspect, though, a British feature film or documentary on the same subject would have opted for miserablism and found an end-of-the-pier show that was just about to close down for ever. Meurer has instead found a show that is a big success, in rude commercial health and doing its bit to keep Brexit Britain together.Seaside Special is a time capsule for that almost forgotten era: after the Brexit vote, but before Covid, when the nation was convulsed by daily headlines about hard Brexit, soft Brexit, leaving with a deal, leaving without a deal, and whether or not Theresa May was a more impressive politician than Boris Johnson. The show goes on and the politicians\u2019 incompetence is resolutely ignored. There are some Johnson fans here, of course, and the show itself is a little like Boris, only without the cynicism and mendacity.There is a strange and heartbreakingly sad footnote: standup comic Paul Eastwood, a cruise-ship veteran and Cromer show regular who was hugely loved by the audiences here, and sometimes shown in sad-clown mode pensively smoking, died in an accident just after this film was made.When the cast perform their heartfelt rendition of We\u2019re Off to See the Wizard from The Wizard of Oz followed by Daft Punk\u2019s Get Lucky, it is unironically brilliant. The Cromer end-of-the-pier show should run all year: maybe they can do a residency in Hamburg.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotion Seaside Special screened on 16 April at Riverside, Woodbridge and on 17 May at the Flatpack festival, Birmingham; it is released on 10 November in UK and Irish cinemas.","262":"The curious wrestle between pratfalls and pathos that\u2019s made Adam Sandler\u2019s career so increasingly fascinating has erred toward a win for the latter with age. The aggressive forgettability of his early Netflix deal output slowly faded into something more worthwhile with last year\u2019s surprisingly textured basketball drama Hustle and simultaneously, we\u2019ve seen the Safdies squeeze out his best work in Uncut Gems (the trio will collaborate again with a new film set in the world of sports memorabilia) and later this year he\u2019ll star alongside Carey Mulligan in the offbeat sci-fi drama Spaceman. While a total ban on fart jokes is unlikely (he\u2019s also set to star in a new Netflix comedy from the director of The Wrong Missy), his 10 for them, one for me ethos is definitely shifting.Murder Mystery, his most watched Netflix film to date was one that didn\u2019t exactly straddle these two halves but made for a more acceptable use of his sillier side, thanks greatly to the appearance of Jennifer Aniston. It was a breezy action comedy about a wannabe detective couple trying to solve a murder while on vacation, a low-stakes Friday night watch with medium rewards. The same could be said about the totally adequate follow-up out this week, so similar in every way that it feels as if we\u2019ve just clicked \u201cplay next episode\u201d.In a post-Poker Face world (a throwback hour-long mystery-of-the-week show I have slight issues with but skillfully leaps through whodunnit beats with speed), this often feels like it would be better suited to a TV format as well, a simple script inelegantly stretched. The credits roll here before we\u2019ve even reached the 80-minute mark but even that starts to feel padded, car chases and explosions serving to distract us from a murder mystery that\u2019s criminally short on both.This time, the couple is headed to an extravagant destination wedding (the film does, at the very least, boast multiple, non-green-screened locations, a genuine treat in the streaming era) to celebrate their friend Vikram (a returning Adeel Akhtar) and his marriage to a Parisian shopgirl-done-good (the ever-charming M\u00e9lanie Laurent). But, to their slight relief, chaos cuts things short with a murder and a kidnap, forcing them both on a brief adventure.In the first outing, Sandler\u2019s cop and Aniston\u2019s hairdresser were desperate to be detectives and in the second, they\u2019ve progressed somewhat to become unlicensed ones, flubbing their way through fourth-rate jobs involving potential cheating spouses. There\u2019s something interestingly amoral about their opportunistic glee over a violent murder happening in front of them and how it might improve their careers and marriage but it\u2019s also interestingly unexplored, returning screenwriter James Vanderbilt not wanting to make them anything other than extremely easy-to-like. The mystery they become entangled with isn\u2019t really tangled enough, with a short suspect list (including Jodie Turner-Smith\u2019s bitchy countess and Mark Strong\u2019s super-detective) and a tired ransom plot that relies more on passable action set pieces than any real twists or suspense (the finale in particular is all flash and very little else).It\u2019s made just-about-watchable by Sandler and Aniston again, whose combined movie star charm proves magnetic enough to carry us through the flatter moments, both nailing some effectively chaotic physical comedy and maintaining a warm, relaxed chemistry. It might not give Sandler the sort of latter-day challenge we now know he can handle so well but it\u2019s an easy win for the pair and for Netflix, the film sure to be another much-watched and endlessly followed-up sequel. I just wish the script had made things a little harder for them and for us, a murder mystery to be solved with eyes closed and watched with eyes elsewhere.Murder Mystery 2 is now available on Netflix","263":"\u2018A global pandemic is only in the top three weird things that have happened to me in the last three years,\u201d Lewis Capaldi notes at the start of this generically made but nonetheless startling Netflix documentary about his rise. After years strumming in Scottish pubs and clubs, his raw piano ballad Bruises went viral and lift-off was vertical: his debut album became the biggest seller in the UK in both 2019 and 2020, and its single Someone You Loved, a seven-week chart topper in the UK, made him the first Scottish solo artist to reach US No 1 since Sheena Easton in 1981. An endearing goofball on social media, Capaldi won even more fans by puncturing influencer culture with his blithely unglamorous image, but his japes disguised a man suffering from terrible anxiety, panic attacks and a shoulder twitch that would later be diagnosed as a Tourette\u2019s symptom.These highs and lows are documented by Joe Pearlman, using the same televised-therapy approach he used to great effect for his film Bros: After the Screaming Stops. He follows Capaldi, now massively famous, to a studio in his Whitburn family home where he starts work on his second album. There\u2019s a flash of typical Capaldi wit as he\u2019s recognised by a woman sat in an optician\u2019s far across the street: \u201cYou\u2019re cured!\u201dLady Gaga, Katy Perry, Billie Eilish and George Ezra are among the singers who have by now made this kind of soul-baring shaky-cam documentary into a cliche; in a social media age, pop stars must broadcast their trauma to stay relatable rather than keep it to themselves, and so they might as well do it on their own terms. Capaldi is alive to how constructed everything is, telling Pearlman he can finish a scene of him packing for an LA trip with a shot of a plane flying overhead \u2013 which Pearlman then does.It\u2019s an amusing moment, but Pearlman isn\u2019t always self-aware. At one of Capaldi\u2019s lowest ebbs, his shoulder twitches violently and he puts his head in his hands as he talks desperately about his hopes for the new album. Pearlman follows up with jump-scare edits of screaming fans soundtracked with screeching ambient noise, a tacky and emotionally manipulative choice for a moment that should be calm, and dignifying Capaldi.Nevertheless, Pearlman clearly does put Capaldi, his family and his sizeable supporting cast of pals and industry bods at ease, resulting in some astonishingly frank scenes. It may be that his manager Ryan Walter is generally a supportive colleague and astute businessman, but not on the basis of a horrible exchange here, as Capaldi plays him a new song. Walter\u2019s first question: \u201cIs it a hit single?\u201d Musical director Aiden Halliday looks at him like he\u2019s defecated on his car bonnet. Capaldi worries the new one is bit similar to Someone You Loved. \u201cAnd what? That\u2019s a good thing ... people love stuff that sounds the same as it,\u201d Walter says consolingly, the risk-averse, creatively-redundant major label mindset defined. But it gets worse still, as Walter warns Capaldi: \u201cI\u2019ve definitely put all my eggs in one basket ... and [if you] fuck it up ...\u201d As a whole retinue of people realise how much money they can make, Pearlman shows the atmosphere of expectation that forms a dark cloud over Capaldi.Thankfully, even when Capaldi is surrounded and cowed by bronzed executives, you know he has the talent and emotional acuity of an artist, qualities these industry functionaries can\u2019t really grasp. His overlords have sent him to LA to write with two very capable songwriters in Dan Nigro and Amy Allen, but this is shit-at-a-wall creativity and Capaldi, who wrote Someone You Loved on his own in his parents\u2019 house, knows it: \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t work like that \u2026 Do I even know what I like, now?\u201dThat second album is coming out in May and the six-man co-write of lead single Forget Me suggests Capaldi didn\u2019t exactly go back to first principles. But towards the end of the film he is shown launching the single \u2013 soon another No 1 \u2013 in high spirits, in between working out and eating microwaveable plastic containers of green veg. Pearlman shows that Capaldi has become even more of a celebrity cliche, the star who\u2019s been on a journey and come out the other side \u2013 but you imagine Capaldi, with his indefatigable wryness, is all too aware of that. Lewis Capaldi: How I\u2019m Feeling Now is released on 5 April on Netflix.","264":"Having resolved to extricate himself from the chains of civilisation, Nils Leidal has taken solitary refuge among the mountains of Norway. While his basically furnished shed and daily rituals of scavenging and ice baths hark back to a simpler way of life, the sixtysomething is also glued to his internet-connected smartphone. The paradox is beguiling: how does one maintain a philosophy of self-sufficiency while simultaneously broadcasting his existence online?Unfocused in its structure, Joost van der Wiel\u2019s muddled documentary grapples with these fascinating contradictions on a superficial level. Apart from Nils\u2019 vague distrust of the government, as evidenced in a video in which he burns his passport, the film offers little information about his background or the reasons behind his self-imposed exile. Punctuated by nondescript drone shots of the beautiful landscape, Dr\u00f8mmeland is mostly preoccupied with Nils\u2019 more eccentric behaviour, like his rueful moaning to a lover on the phone, or his habit of hunting in the nude. Haphazardly edited with little consideration for his state of mind, these sequences come off as voyeuristic or plain strange.In stark contrast to Lizzie MacKenzie\u2019s affecting The Hermit of Treig, which portrayed the life of a recluse with vivid intimacy, Dr\u00f8mmeland gawks at its subject instead of meaningfully connecting with his unusual reality. The most dynamic confrontation occurs when police officers knock on Nils\u2019 door to inquire about the death of his beloved horse, a reminder of the far-reaching power of state surveillance. These moments of interest, however, are few and far between; Dr\u00f8mmeland just doesn\u2019t cohere into a perceptive look at the dilemmas that come with retreating from modern society. Dr\u00f8mmeland is available from 31 March on True Story.","265":"Blending science fiction and magical realism, environmental catastrophe and family secrets, Francisca Alegr\u00eda\u2019s heady mystery is an ambitious and murkily atmospheric debut. Set in Chile, this Spanish-language picture takes a real-life event \u2013 the pollution of a river by a paper mill \u2013 as a jumping-off point. The disaster kills fish and wildlife, but it reanimates Magdalena (M\u00eda Maestro), who drowned in the river many years before. Mute, Magdalena now communicates through digital technology. The tech-fantasy crossover has a kinship with the recent Neptune Frost, but most of all this film about motherhood and natural balance has unexpected parallels with Andrea Arnold\u2019s Cow.","266":"The impressive feature debut from actor turned director Manuela Martelli, 1976 is an elegantly circumspect Spanish-language drama set against the backdrop of Pinochet-era Chile. Carmen (Aline K\u00fcppenheim) is a chic older woman whose marriage to a doctor has afforded her an enviably sheltered lifestyle. Her primary concern when we meet her is choosing exactly the right paint colour for the renovations on her summer home. But then the local priest persuades her to care for a wounded radical, El\u00edas (Nicol\u00e1s Sep\u00falveda), and Carmen starts to realise just how dangerous her country is for those who dare to disagree with its leaders.K\u00fcppenheim is terrific, her precision and restraint in the role drawing us into the story. Mari\u00e1 Portugal\u2019s analogue electronic score is eerily atmospheric. And a recurring motif of shoes reminds us of the importance of toeing the Pinochet line.","267":"You expect that the stunts and fight choreography of a John Wick film will be top tier. The director, former kickboxer Chad Stahelski, got his start in the movie industry as a stuntman after all, serving as Keanu Reeves\u2019s stunt double in The Matrix. Extravagantly showy stunt work is a given, and it\u2019s the main reason to watch these enjoyably pulpy slaughterfests \u2013 certainly more so than the plot, which reprises the basic structure of past films, with Wick (Keanu Reeves) slicing his way through the countless henchmen of his former employers, the High Table. But even by the standards of the past Wick outings, this is remarkable. Human bodies are hurled into moving vehicles; Reeves\u2019s double tumbles down the entire length of the Sacr\u00e9-Coeur stairs. And, just to remind us that we are in the hands of an action master, Stahelski delivers one extended, mind-bogglingly complicated fight sequence in what appears to be a single shot, the camera floating overhead.Stahelski reteams with key crew, including production designer Kevin Kavanaugh, who retains his fondness for neon tube structures and colour coding. But there\u2019s fresh blood in the cast, most notably a deliciously insouciant Donnie Yen, as blind assassin Caine, and Scott Adkins, who is enormous fun as Killa, a murderous plus-sized German equipped with metal teeth, all the better for chewing the scenery.","268":"Often mocked by standup comedians and sitcom writers \u2013 a sure sign of its ubiquity \u2013 ayahuasca, the hallucinogenic tea, has brought an influx of western travellers going on healing retreats to the forests of Peru. Focusing on its medicinal properties, Marc Silver\u2019s documentary aims to dispel certain misconceptions about the psychedelic brew.Among Indigenous people, rituals involving ayahuasca have been practised for millennia. Made from vines and other plant extracts, the concoction relieves patients of physical and mental traumas. The cure also carries a ceremonial aspect; the taking of the medicine is at times accompanied by songs and chants.Once deemed satanic by Catholic missionaries during colonial times, ayahuasca ironically now finds new converts among foreigners, whose vivid testimonials of their powerful hallucinations are recounted in detail. Nevertheless, this film seems either unwilling or ill-equipped to tackle the thornier aspects of the ayahuasca tourism boom. For example, what is the material relationship between the local community and the organisers of these wellness residencies? As well as assuming the role of a guiding force during ayahuasca ceremonies, Indigenous people also provide the meals and accommodation. Is this labour fairly compensated?Furthermore, the film touches on the environmental threat of oil companies encroaching on Indigenous land yet neglects to examine the sustainability of ayahuasca tourism. Could it in fact be another form of capitalist exploitation and extraction of natural resources masquerading as wellness?Though commendable in its attempt to understand ayahuasca as a legitimate and effective form of alternative medicine, Antidote suffers from a lack of intellectual rigour that leaves the final product seeming like a glossy travel brochure. Antidote is released on 24 March in cinemas","269":"In his second full-length documentary, Swiss director Andrea Pellerani gives us a guided tour of what a post-industrial, post-growth, or even an eerily post-human future might look like. We are on the south-western Japanese island of Ikeshima. Once a thriving mining outpost that was home to 8,000 people, since the facility\u2019s closure in 2001 it has been reduced to just 100 mostly elderly holdouts. As the residents fish the grey sea off abandoned wharves, inspect pregnant cats and loiter around derelict lots, there is a sense they inhabit the set of a long-shuttered stage play, and are awaiting new lines.Though it begins with long tracking shots of greenery choking empty apartment blocks, Dreaming an Island isn\u2019t exactly ruin porn. Pellerani is more interested in the vestiges of human activity, and milks a distinct absurdity from the stalwart locals. One collects \u201cfun\u201d beach flotsam, there are guides waiting rather optimistically for an upswing in coal-mining tourism, while Ikeshima\u2019s sole restaurateur hopes for a customer. \u201cIs there anything interesting to see?\u201d asks one who finally turns up. \u201cIn what sense interesting?\u201d she replies.The existential quotient spikes in the sections at the island\u2019s school, where 11 teachers cater to just two pupils. A tutor has one of them running sprint drills out on the training field, preparing for some hypothetical athletics meet.No doubt because it\u2019s inherent to the subject matter, Ikeshima\u2019s stasis makes it tricky for Pellerani to find dramatic through-lines; filling even 76 minutes feels like a struggle. Ikeshima is a canary in the coalmine for Japan, which, with its plummeting birth rate and stagnant economy, is often itself talked up as a canary for the rest of the developed world. But if this wan afterlife really is our future, then Pellerani also emphasises a dutiful bravery in affirming old ways and believing they can be renewed. In a peppy coda, children and teachers arrive at an old people\u2019s home to present them with artwork, play darts and sing old-time ditties. Mines can be exhausted but human connection endures in this fond not-quite-swansong. Dreaming an Island is available on True Story from 24 March","270":"Adapted by Call the Midwife creator Heidi Thomas from the 2018 play by Alan Bennett, set in a geriatric hospital unit in Yorkshire populated by lovable eccentrics and starring a formidable selection of seasoned British acting talent (Judi Dench, Jennifer Saunders, David Bradley and Derek Jacobi star), Allelujah should be a slam dunk of a crowd-pleaser. Unfortunately, Richard Eyre\u2019s film is jarringly uneven: such a collision of tones and conflicting messages that it undermines its own earnest coda in support of the NHS.The hospital is threatened by penny-pinching government officials. The medical staff struggle on, undaunted. But what seems to be a stirring tale of a community standing up against the powers that be takes a darker turn as the story swerves unexpectedly \u2013 and rather clumsily \u2013 into thriller territory.","271":"A tender tribute to her Algerian grandparents, who emigrated to the French medieval town of Thiers in the 1950s, Lina Soualem\u2019s touching documentary shows how the act of filming can awaken memories that have long laid dormant. A\u00efcha, the bubbly matriarch, looks youthful beyond her years, and can\u2019t help but lapse into fits of shy giggles when prodded with questions about love and marriage. Husband Mabrouk is starkly withdrawn in contrast to her infectious warmth. As the couple decide to separate after 62 years of marriage, home videos of family celebrations become even more bittersweet in their fragile vibrancy.A familiar face in French cinema, Soualem\u2019s father, Zinedine Soualem, says with a matter-of-fact sadness that Mabrouk never complimented him on the success of his career. Consequently the documentary feels like Lina Soualem\u2019s attempt to break a cycle of generational miscommunication and repression. Unfolding with the gentle casualness of everyday conversation, her interviews with her grandparents not only draw her closer to their personal history but also paint a vivid picture of the hardships endured by Algerian immigrants in 1950s France. Mabrouk, for example, was among countless Algerian young men employed on low wages by a cutlery factory in Thiers. The loud noises resulting from the production of shiny knives and forks would later render many of these workers deaf.Throughout her film, Lina Soualem only appears in a tiny square on Zoom calls or as a little girl in old family home movies. Yet her presence is felt in her voice, floating in and out of conversations, and in the way she lovingly photographs her grandparents, down to Mabrouk\u2019s white panama hat. Their Algeria not only travels to the past, it is also Soualem\u2019s journey to discover her own Algeria. Their Algeria is released on 17 March on True Story","272":"Theatre director Pravesh Kumar has written and directed an affectionate comedy about a dysfunctional British south Asian family. It\u2019s a film very much in the tradition of sitcom-ish Brit movies: the comedy painted in broad strokes, warm-hearted but with an unmistakable air of naffness. It just about gets by on sheer likability and warmth for its Punjabi family living in a Slough semi.We meet them just as eldest son Raj (Simon Rivers) does a runner after his wedding to Simmy (Rameet Rauli); she\u2019s newly arrived from India, barely speaking a word of English. The marriage has been arranged by Raj\u2019s overbearing mum Gurbaksh (Seema Bowri). To keep up appearances with their nosy neighbours, she confiscates Simmy\u2019s passport and keeps her new daughter-in-law locked up in the house. I did wonder if the film is a bit lighthearted in its treatment of domestic abuse.At first Simmy feels a gravitational pull of loyalty to her new family \u2013 and patiently waits for her awol husband to return. But soon she begins to find her feet: step one, learning English from the telly. Then the family\u2019s youngest son Harry (Viraj Juneja) shows up, freshly released from prison \u2013 much to his mother\u2019s shame. And you know exactly where the story is headed when Simmy accidentally trips into Harry\u2019s arms the moment she first claps eyes on him.Clearly, Little English is made for a family audience. Even so, there are quite a few clumsily broad moments of comedy here. Some genuinely funny scenes too: an aunty armed with a taser gun brings down a thief. One afternoon Harry takes Simmy out by the river. \u201cI never knew Slough could be so beautiful,\u201d she says in wonder. Little English probably does have the makings of a decent sitcom; the process would develop the characters and perhaps get something sharper from the script, which feels like an early draft in places. Little English is released on 17 March in UK cinemas.","273":"American director Phil Blattenberger gets props here for stretching his budget clingfilm-thin to mount a respectable revival of a bygone genre: the you\u2019ve-only-gone-and-blown-the-bloody-doors-off wartime 1960\/70s action-adventure. Well, to be precise, the post-wartime action-adventure, with some sweeping pampas vistas and strategically deployed name casting \u2013 including a fleeting glimpse of old warhorse Michael Ironside \u2013 pepping up a South American Nazi hunt.\u201cThey say the man who seeks revenge should dig two graves,\u201d is the advice proffered to one-time allied sniper Will Spalding (Jacob Keohane). He is in Argentina to atone for failing to protect his B17 crewmates when they are downed near enemy lines. Torturing and assassinating his way down a list of German expats, he is hunting for Colonel Martin Bach (The Mummy\u2019s Arnold Vosloo), who executed his comrades in cold blood. A chance encounter in a bar with atomic physicist Albert Vogel (Al Pagano) points to where Bach is lying low, but the Mossad operative Leyna Rahn (Corinne Britti) is itching to liquidate the scientist before he can assist Spalding.With Bach acting as security chief to a certain A-list goosestepper imagined here to have survived the war, Blattenberger decides to ride the Tarantinoesque alt-history high road. Sometimes this inspiration becomes too apparent, especially in Jackson Rathbone\u2019s genially menacing Nazi barfly \u2013 reminiscent of Christoph Waltz\u2019s Hans Landa \u2013 and a digression on eugenics that echoes the skull scene in Django Unchained. But despite this, as well as a loose hand on the plotting rudder and often-shaky direction, Blattenberger\u2019s energetic screenplay, with its obvious love for the genre, allows him to outrun these problems.Keohane is unremittingly dour in the lead and \u2013 until presented with a last-minute devil\u2019s bargain that weighs up the meaning of heroism \u2013 not really called on to leaven it with introspection. But Pagano lives it up with an urbane playfulness as the scientist of uncertain allegiances, and Vosloo has an imposing dark integrity as the unapologetic party man. Despite the uneven execution, Condor\u2019s Nest has just enough bite. Condor\u2019s Nest is available on digital platforms on 20 March.","274":"The past returns in all its ugliness and torment in Sylvaine Dampierre\u2019s rigorous documentary which challenges the preconceived notion that the march of time automatically parallels the march of progress. In 1842 in the Guadeloupe archipelago, an enslaved man named S\u00e9bastien was accused of sorcery by his master, and left to die in his cell. Centuries later, workers at a sugar factory in Marie-Galante, the island where S\u00e9bastien died, read out transcipts from the trial surrounding his death.In opening a portal to the cruelty suffered by S\u00e9bastien at the hands of his masters, who were acquitted, the film draws a link to labour exploitation endured by the factory workers in modern-day Marie-Galante. Their jobs are precarious and expendable. As employment opportunities on the island are scarce, the workers have little choice but to be subjected to gruelling conditions for inadequate wages. Scenes where the men harvest sugar cane under the burning sun eerily mirror passages from the historical court documents, which describe the physical toil of field work in harrowing detail. Slavery is long abolished, yet the current system of exploitation continues to leave little agency to the workers.Wrapped in a cacophony of hissing sounds and grinding metals, sequences shot inside the factory have a disquieting beauty, as they simultaneously evoke the rhythm of the workers\u2019 daily rituals and reveal the bosses\u2019 neglect for their wellbeing. Technologically outdated, and perhaps even dangerous to operate, some machines seem as old as the factory itself, which opened in 1996. In raising awareness of the hazardous environment experienced by the workers, Dampierre\u2019s film powerfully traces how the hierarchies of the past continue to foster social inequalities in the present. Words of Negroes is available from 10 March on True Story.","275":"Karmack is a US town so unlucky that someone is employed specifically to deliver the daily batches of bad news. The latest \u201cmiddle man\u201d is Frank (P\u00e5l Sverre Hagen), who, it turns out, suffers from his own share of the town\u2019s misfortunes. This English-language feature from Norwegian director Bent Hamer (Kitchen Stories) is infused with a very Nordic tragicomic sensibility. And this, together with a predominantly Scandinavian cast, means that the film feels oddly rootless, never quite persuading as a piece of small-town Americana. Still, it is ruefully entertaining and looks terrific, with a colour palette of sullen blues and ill-natured yellows.","276":"Here is an interesting and, towards the end, actually quite moving study of American \u00e9migr\u00e9 painter Mary Cassatt, one of three female artists who took part in the celebrated impressionist exhibitions in late 19th-century Paris, and whose biographers here do an excellent job of reclaiming from relative obscurity. In fact, they do considerably more: Cassatt is built up to be a pioneering feminist voice in an art world that at the time was largely hostile to female painters.Unlike most of films in the Exhibition on Screen series, this is not related to a blockbuster exhibition, or even a specific collection: it\u2019s instead a general overview of Cassatt\u2019s life and work, starting with her privileged upbringing in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, before her near-permanent shift to Europe after the American civil war, and the consequent headway she made with the then radical impressionist movement (including her strong friendship and collaboration with Edgar Degas.)There\u2019s certainly a corrective element to this film, highlighting a female artist in a series that has hitherto concentrated (understandably enough) on the likes of Monet, Vermeer and Raphael; this is an interesting and educative act of expanding the canon. Cassatt\u2019s later paintings of women and children come in for a good deal of attention: finely painted and \u2013 as one of the expert voices says \u2013 quietly symbolic of Cassatt\u2019s political commitment to female suffrage.Strictly as a documentary, this doesn\u2019t depart from Exhibition on Screen\u2019s standard template: leisurely closeups of the work, informed comment from knowledgable curators, the odd bit of voiceover and staged re-enactment. It does, however, draw Cassatt out as a tough and independent character, pursuing her own artistic path and very much worthy of the respect she has been largely denied by history.Mary Cassatt: Painting the Modern Woman is released on 8 March in cinemas.","277":"Cluttered as it is with magical, mystical MacGuffins, ghosts, curses and ominous knick-knacks, this cheap but seldom cheerful horror feature is the cinematic equivalent of a thrift store of evil. The plot revolves around the Snyder family: insurance salesman dad Daniel (Will Klipstine, also the film\u2019s writer-director), fervent Catholic mum Theresa (Amanda MacDonald), and young daughter and conduit of evil Rosalie (Madeleine McGraw). The poor kid used to be a happy, unexceptional moppet who, judging by the many saccharine sun-filled flashbacks we\u2019re shown, enjoyed playing football and making cupcakes with her parents. But something happened along the way and now she ominously announces at funerals that the deceased is burning in hell at that very moment, and that a servant of the devil called the Harbinger has arrived (does that make her the Harbinger\u2019s harbinger?).Either way, the Snyders move to what seems like an unremarkable midwestern suburb where the neighbours are super-creepy with their excessive hospitality and talk of neighbourhood watch. On the outskirts of town there\u2019s a Native American seer called Floating Hawk (Irene Bedard) who conveniently dispenses exposition about what\u2019s really going on which, honest-to-God, involves sacred burial grounds, giant keys and evil-dispersing daggers. If a monkey\u2019s paw and a cursed amulet had been thrown in the mix, I wouldn\u2019t have been surprised.It\u2019s hard to call which is clunkier, Klipstine\u2019s herky-jerky direction or his shouty acting. But at least you can give him some credit for casting McGraw, who can deliver her absurd dialogue with the kind of deadpan straight face that Buster Keaton would admire. Veteran supporting player Steve Monroe (Crazy Ex-Girlfriend) is also a hoot as a jocular neighbour who obviously isn\u2019t the buffoon he seems to be. The Curse of Rosalie is on the Icon channel from 13 March and in UK cinemas from 14 April.","278":"Ten years after directing and self-distributing his feature debut Papadopoulos & Sons, Marcus Markou is back with another impressively-put-together low-budget movie. This time around he\u2019s made a serious and slightly self-conscious divorce drama with a pair of deeply-felt performances by Laura Bayston and Laurence Spellman. They play Cassie and Matthew, a couple from London, separating in their 40s.To the outside world, Cassie and Matthew\u2019s divorce looks like the model of amicability: they\u2019ve managed to agree on everything without going to court. But it gets messy at their final mediation session, as years of hurt and resentment boil over. Cassie has been the breadwinner, and she can\u2019t help bringing up the fact that she\u2019s \u201cgiving\u201d Matthew the house. Furious, he yells that he gave up a career in teaching to raise the kids. It\u2019s a shaky start to the film, a bit shouty with some awkwardly clumsy comedy inserted by their hopeless mediator.But the film gets into its stride as Cassie and Matthew carry out a series of tasks laid out in a letter they wrote together as newlyweds, addressed to their future selves in the event of divorce. The tasks (like going on their first date again) are clearly intended to rekindle their love. But after a couple of decades together it\u2019s more complicated than that. Their marriage is like a vase smashed into a dozen pieces; the damage is done. But at times Cassie and Matthew seem to convince themselves it can be glued back together again.This is an interesting, worthwhile movie that genuinely gets under the skin of a long marriage \u2013 though at times the drama feels a bit contrived and overworked, especially scenes involving Cassie\u2019s extramarital relationships. And what\u2019s with that title? It feels years out of date to define a woman unironically as a \u201cwife\u201d, or call a man who works in the home a \u201chouse husband\u201d.It is being shown in cinemas alongside Markou\u2019s 12 minute film Two Strangers Who Meet Five Times (clearly he has a thing for lengthy and literal titles). The short, a sentimental tale about a damaged homeless man and a rich start-up entrepreneur, has racked up three million views on YouTube. The Wife and Her House Husband is released on 10 March in cinemas.","279":"Here\u2019s another cutesy-sentimental American indie about a character struggling to grow up, and drifting with no real sense of what to do in life. Adopting Audrey takes it one further, turning the quirky dial up to 11 with its story about a woman who puts herself up for adoption in her 30s. (Adult adoption is legal in the US, though not in the UK)Audrey is played by Jena Malone with warmth and thoughtfulness; her performance the most distinctive thing about this otherwise forgettable movie. Audrey is single and often unable to pay the rent, flitting from job to job. You sense depression or loneliness creeping in, spending her evenings watching cute animal videos. One night YouTube\u2019s algorithm pings her from puppy adoption videos to ones about human adult adoption; Audrey decides to give it a go.After a string of failed first dates with potential parents, she meets a retired couple who might just be her forever family. This is Sunny (Emily Kuroda) and Otto (Robert Hunger-B\u00fchler), both widowed when they met a few years ago. Otto is a cranky retired Nasa engineer, who has a terrible relationship with his own adult children. But with Audrey he opens up a little and begins to reflect on his overbearing parenting style.What I found irritating about the film is how the characters behave in ways that bear no resemblance to the real world. Take Otto\u2019s kids, who are mildly irked by Audrey\u2019s arrival, but not remotely alarmed. Surely they would be straight on the phone to a lawyer t0 find out their inheritance rights? Or at the very least grilling Audrey about her intentions?Still, there\u2019s something so winning about Malone. Her Audrey is nice and eager-to-please as she puts up with cantankerous Otto. But Malone suggests a kind of passive-aggressive side to her gentle manner, showing us that Audrey\u2019s style is to take the crap for so long, then walk away. Her engrossing, authentic-feeling performance is the reason to watch. Adopting Audrey is released on 13 March on digital platforms.","280":"Bandit is one of those true-crime films where you come away with the impression that the film-makers have spent a bit too long hanging out with their subject, sitting in smoky bars listening to tall tales about the good ol\u2019 bad days. It\u2019s sincere enough but tells an utterly hokey and indulgent story about armed robber Gilbert Galvan, who went on a stick-up spree across Canada in the 1980s, pulling off nearly 60 robberies in three years targeting banks and jewellers. Newspapers called him \u201cthe flying bandit\u201d.The film paints Galvan\u2019s crimes as more or less victimless \u2013 repeatedly showing what a polite and cordial bank robber he is, never firing a gun. It\u2019s a glossy old-fashioned movie, mixing a bit of action with tongue-in-cheek comedy. Josh Duhamel gives a performance that\u2019s all charm and no depth as Galvan, a career criminal we first meet escaping from a Michigan prison and hightailing it north of the border. In Ottawa, he changes his name to Robert Whiteman and gets into the armed robbery business, bankrolled by a local criminal hardman (Mel Gibson, about as menacing as a fairy cake).Galvan\u2019s first fumbling stick-up is played for laughs. \u201cHow did I do?\u201d he asks the cashier at the end. And there\u2019s a lot of focus here on his silly wigs and comedy disguises \u2013 what a nice-guy bank robber he is. (You can picture the director\u2019s instructions to the actors playing the bank cashiers: \u201cLook scared, but not that scared\u201d.) The film is on pretty thin ice too with its shaky justifications for Galvin\u2019s life of crime. He had a tough childhood, we learn, and when he meets trainee social worker Andrea (Elisha Cuthbert), he keeps on with the robberies to provide for his family. Duhamel is always an easy, likable watch, and this is a reasonably entertaining film \u2013 but not exactly abundant with insight. Bandit is available now on Prime Video.","281":"If you\u2019ve seen the sensational true crime documentary series The Staircase, you\u2019ll know the story. In 2001, after Kathleen Peterson was found dead at the bottom of the stairs at her home in North Carolina, police suspicion turned to her novelist husband Michael Peterson. When he allowed a documentary team to film what happened next, Peterson said it was because he was worried about getting a fair trial. His adopted daughter, Margaret Ratliff, 20 at the time, grief-stricken and terrified that her dad could be facing the death penalty, agreed to be part of the film. The loss of her privacy in the years since has been devastating, she admits now. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how painful it is, reliving my mum\u2019s death over and over again.\u201dThis super-thoughtful and sensitive documentary also interviews the \u201cstars\u201d of other well-known documentaries. Arthur Agee was a 14-year-old basketball prodigy from a tough neighbourhood in Chicago when film-makers arrived to shoot Hoop Dreams. Jesse Friedman spent 13 years in jail after he and his father Arnold pleaded guilty in 1998 to sexually abusing children \u2013 a conviction put into doubt by the 2003 film Capturing the Friedmans. Mukunda Angulo was raised in a New York apartment isolated from the world by his controlling dad, as detailed in The Wolfpack.Ratliff never received a penny for her involvement in The Staircase, and in Subject, industry experts argue for and against paying participants. I found myself agreeing that it\u2019s unfair for a subject to be the only one not making money from their own story. A producer of Hoop Dreams explains that when the film became a surprise box office hit, they went back to Chicago and gave everyone with a speaking role a cut of the profits. For Arthur Agee, that money has been life-changing \u2013 around $500,000 to date.The question of who gets to tell stories is discussed (spoiler: mostly white men, until recently), and for a 97-minute film, Subject squeezes in a lot of ethical biggies. What duty of care do you owe a person if you sweep them up into a movie? Does a film-maker need to consider the mental health of a subject? One expert argues that if film contracts can include intimacy coordinators, why not also counsellors? Ratliff is only too aware of the toll that being in a hit documentary can take: \u201cIt messed up me and my sister so bad.\u201dSign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotion Subject is released on 3 March in UK cinemas.","282":"Director Kensuke Sonomura started off as a stunt performer and coordinator, so it\u2019s no surprise that his second directorial effort contains lashings of hand-to-hand combat. Indeed, just as the climactic cops v gangsters showdown is about to kick off, elderly lawman Torada (Hitoshi Ozawa) urges everyone not to use silly, unsporting guns, and miraculously both sides agree and go to it with fists and knives. It\u2019s just as well because, hitherto, almost every time someone has fired a gun in anger in this film they have missed the target. Does that mean all those movies where folks hit their target with one bullet are lying? Or is this one, where everyone is pants at shooting, the misrepresentation? Either way, it\u2019s almost enough to make you question your core beliefs in the efficacy of cinematic firearms.Anyway, if you like watching actors and stunt folk battle it out, this is great stuff but the connecting plot strung between fights is more of a chore. In fictional Japanese metropolis Kaiko City, corruption is rife and it all seems to stem from Wataru Gojo (Lily Franky) who has designs on redeveloping a poor part of the city. As Gojo is announcing his bid to become Kaiko\u2019s mayor, we see a bathhouse of lushly tattooed yakuza get wiped out by a single long-haired squinting assassin (Tak Sakaguchi). Is he working for Madam (Rino Katase), queenpin of the Korean mafia in Kaiko, who rather entertainingly dresses like someone trying to shoplift all the stock from a Versace boutique at the same time. The chief prosecutor and his assistant put together a taskforce of honest cops from the Violent Crimes unit, and place Torada in charge, even though up until now he\u2019s been in jail on charges that connect him to Madam.Now in his 60s, Ozawa was a major player back in the days of Japan\u2019s V-Cinema, straight-to-video films that were cult viewing in the 1980s and 90s; consequently Bad City represents a retro homage to the pulpy values of that subgenre. Some viewers may find it a little too pulpy, reliant as it is on boilerplate dialogue, and it is not exactly rich in subtlety. All the nuance is in the grace of the fight scenes, as lovingly choreographed as a production of Swan Lake. Bad City is released on 6 March on digital platforms.","283":"This pandemic-set drama exudes frustration and exasperation, but always remains in touch with an essential openness and optimism. It\u2019s anchored in a smart performance from co-director Kalley Kali who, as bereaved gig-economy hustler Danny, seems in a permanent state of sadness and mild distraction \u2013 though possibly the latter is something to do with the fact she performs most of the time on rollerblades.Danny is living in a tent in the scrub somewhere on the edge of Los Angeles (presumably Pacoima, where this was filmed) with her eight-year-old daughter, Wes (Wesley Moss). She tells her kid that it\u2019s just for fun, trying to shield her from the harsh truth: they\u2019ve become homeless following the death of her partner and Wes\u2019s father. After dropping Wes off at daycare, Danny straps on her leopard-print blades and, moonlighting between hair-braiding and food delivery, attempts to squeeze out the $200 she needs before day\u2019s end to make a deposit on a flat.After a couple of disappointing hair appointments, Danny runs into cocksure old friend Brooklynn (BK Marie) at the launderette; she\u2019s about to move her family in with her new fella, despite having only been with him for two weeks. In this scene, in a pawnshop where Danny agonises about selling her partner\u2019s ring to a flirty player, and in a disturbing encounter with a friend, Kali and co-director Dominique Molina push a wry but pointed focus on women resorting to sexual currency in tough times \u2013 or refusing to do so.As Danny is hauled about town at a delivery app\u2019s behest, I\u2019m Fine (Thanks for Asking)\u2019s plotting occasionally feels a bit baldly linear \u2013 but it increasingly flexes a lyrical muscle, beginning with a surrealist plunge into stoned anxiety, building up to a stunning LA reverie that releases all Danny\u2019s maternal relief in one go. Kali and Molina\u2019s sun-kissed naturalism and light touch make them a promising new voice in American cinema. I\u2019m Fine (Thanks for Asking) is released on 3 March in UK cinemas.","284":"Hirokazu Kore-eda can claim to be the greatest living Japanese film director, whose family dramas have marked him out as the heir to Ozu (although in an interview with me he said he preferred to be compared with Mikio Naruse). His work, including the Palme-winning Shoplifters (2018) is rightly revered. But he has always had a sweet tooth for whimsy and sentimentality, which I thought was on display in his much admired baby-swap drama Like Father Like Son (2013).Now he has given us a sudsy road-movie heartwarmer set in Korea and inspired by the Korean phenomenon of \u201cbaby boxes\u201d put out by churches for unwanted newborns. But the movie is fundamentally silly, with tiringly shallow characterisation and broad streaks of crime-drama intrigue, which only underline the fact that not a single word of it is really believable.Korean actor Song Kang-ho (famed for starring in Bong Joon-ho\u2019s Parasite) plays Sang-hyeon, a volunteer at a local church that has a \u201cbaby box\u201d. But he is running a \u201cbroker\u201d scam: occasionally he steals a newborn for himself \u2013 erasing the church\u2019s CCTV footage that prove a baby was left there \u2013 and offers it for sale on the adoption black market, with potential couples lined up by his partner Dong-soo (Gang Dong-won), a former orphanage inhabitant with access to information about potential adopters who want newborns rather than institutionalised toddlers. But their lives are made more complicated when young mother So-young (Lee Ji-eun), whose unwanted baby is taken and offered up for sale by these two tricksters, confronts them and instead of telling the police, insists on coming with them on their zany road-trip to interview potential parents. On their trail are a couple of cops, played by Bae Doona and Lee Joo-young.Of course, in the real world, the people running such a nauseating scam would be creepy and loathsome individuals. And let\u2019s say they were claiming \u2013 as these two fictional characters are \u2013 that they were doing the world a service by sidestepping bureaucracy and dreary orphanage care by getting the babies quickly to adoptive parents and moreover handing over most of the fee to the mother, then this, too, would be highly suspect and naive. What sort of people might want to pay top dollar for a baby?But the film presents the two as just lovable, flawed guys who are romantics at heart: tough cookie So-young even tells goofy young Dong-so that he needs to be more hard-hearted because sweet guys like him get eaten alive. The criminality of the proceedings is assigned to the mother, who turns out to have a shadier background than we at first assume. Of course, if anyone can sell such a dodgy premise it is that wonderful actor, Song Kang-ho, but his air of hangdog everyman decency can\u2019t solve the problems of naivety, implausibility and the sugary taste. It\u2019s a rare miss for Kore-eda. Broker screened at the Cannes film festival, and is released in UK cinemas on 24 February.","285":"Jubilee (X, of course) arrives this week at the Gate Two. Which, in case you don\u2019t recognise the cinema, is the former International Bloomsbury, now leased and, one hopes, given a new lease of life by David and Barbara Stone of the Gate, Notting Hill.Jubilee, directed and part-written with James Whaley, by Derek Jarman who made the successful Sebastiane, is not exactly a punk movie. But it does contain music from Adam and the Ants, Siouxsie and the Banshees and Electric Chairs, and characters with such names as Crabs, Amyl Nitrate, Mad and Chaos. The scent of anarchy is near at hand and the current fad for believing that there is nothing left to believe in is everywhere apparent (\u201cLove snuffed it with the hippies. Sex is for geriatrics,\u201d says someone. Myra Hindley is described as a childhood heroine).Jarman\u2019s story looks promising enough. Queen Elizabeth (Jenny Runacre), that historic precursor of modern capitalism, arrives back in a future London (courtesy of John Dee, alchemist, and the Angel Ariel) to find her perfumed garden in total rout. Law and order no longer exist, the old and cherished institutions have finally crumbled and extremists of both left and right are out on the blitz. Royalty is now best represented by Borgia Ginz (Orlando, of the Lindsay Kemp Troupe), a giggling media mogul who gives the people what they want and thus controls them. He uses Buck Palace as a giant recording studio.The past and future meet on a waste tip in Deptford where Bod (Ms Runacre again) crowns herself Queen as the leader of a band of harpies that include a pop singer, a pyromaniac and a nymphomaniac. Amyl Nitrate (Jordan) has been chosen by Borgia to represent England in the Eurovision with a bump-and-grind version of Rule Britannia! But first an ageing punk star has to be eliminated, and meanwhile Crabs (Little Nell) falls for the Kid (Adam Ant) who gets snuffed by the special branch. And the gang seeks bloody revenge.Thus, or so the synopsis informs us, the film progresses from black comedy into real terror. Actually it tends to go from somewhere to nowhere very much. This has a lot to do with the thinness of the political and social comment, the disjointed nature of the narrative and some overbearing and\/or underskilled playing. Shock tactics alone won\u2019t suffice in the cinema, though they may well pay dividends in box office returns.But one thing the film does possess is a fevered and restless imagination, and the images and music to go with it. Brian Eno\u2019s score is first-class, and the general feel of a world hideously out of joint (vide the Godardian burning pram sequence) is well maintained. Jubilee may not be a very good film. But the fact that it exists at all is a kind of justification in the present circumstances. Besides, I\u2019m inclined to think that the humour behind its pretension (\u201cPiss, I\u2019ve broke me Winston Churchill mug\u201d) might just be the saving of it. That and Mr Jarman\u2019s genuine talent for confounding expectations.","286":"Christian Petzold has for years been a titan of German cinema \u2013 and the Berlin film festival itself \u2013 and his new movie is an odd, quibbling tragicomedy with perhaps a little of Bergman\u2019s Smiles of a Summer Night, avowedly intended as the second part of a trilogy about creativity and love (the first being Undine).Afire is an approachable and digestible movie in some ways, and I liked the morose, hangdog look conjured by actor Thomas Schubert playing the miserable young writer Leon, who correctly suspects that his new novel, a zeitgeisty relationship comedy called Club Sandwich, is terrible. But in the end I felt that the film fully achieves neither the ostensible comedy of the opening, nor the supposed sadness of its denouement.Leon and his art student friend Felix(Langston Uibel) have come to a holiday home belonging to Felix\u2019s mum on the Baltic coast, to relax and do some work: Leon will revise his manuscript, and Felix will take some photographs for his portfolio. But their car breaks down on the way and after they turn up, exhausted and on foot, they find that Felix\u2019s mum has let the house to another couple with whom they have to share: Nadja (Paula Beer) and her hunky lifeguard boyfriend Devid (Enno Trebs).Poor Leon soon conceives a hopeless crush on Nadja and gets no sleep listening to her having athletic sex with Devid in the adjacent bedroom; moreover, Felix seems also to have a man crush on the alpha male lifeguard. Leon\u2019s publisher Helmut (Matthias Brandt) is also about to visit, with what promises to be some damaging notes on his book, while the forest fires, turning the night sky red, convey a strange sense of unease.In fact, despite the title (the film\u2019s original German title actually translates as \u201cRed Sky\u201d), there isn\u2019t much of a flame in this film. There are some laughs in Leon\u2019s grumpy, maladroit failure to be agreeable with anyone, as well as his knack of saying the wrong thing with Nadja, for which he berates himself afterwards in private like a young Hugh Grant in a Richard Curtis comedy. And there are some nice scenes as they all have dinner together, or hang out at the beach.The appearance of Helmut signals a supposed new serious shift, and Nadja\u2019s background is revealed. A poem by Heinrich Heine is invoked: Der Asra, about a slave falling in love with a princess. But the tonal change is not really convincing, and I wished that the movie\u2019s potential for lighter comedy had been developed more. Even so, it\u2019s a strong performance from Schubert. Afire screened at the Berlin film festival and is released on 25 August in UK cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema.","287":"There\u2019s gentleness and delicacy in this heartfelt family drama, a fiction feature debut from Basque film-maker Estibaliz Urresola Solaguren. It shows that the crises experienced by children, and by the adults coming to terms with those crises, are part of a larger ecosystem of emotional difficulty in the extended family.Ane (Patricia L\u00f3pez Arnaiz) is a sculptor living in south-west France. She has money worries and problems in her marriage to Gorka (Martxelo Rubio). They have three children, of whom the most troubled is Coc\u00f3 (Sof\u00eda Otero). Eight-year-old Coc\u00f3\u2019s worries and self-questioning emerge when Ane has to take the kids away for a summer break over the border in the Basque Country of Spain, staying with her widowed mother Lourdes (Ane Gaberain), who is now devoted to her beekeeping hobby but whose main occupation was once managing financial accounts for her husband, an artist, like Ane.Coc\u00f3\u2019s given name was in fact originally the boy\u2019s name Aitor, but switched to the indeterminate nickname Coc\u00f3 \u2013 though even this now feels wrong and Coc\u00f3 asks Ane to use the name \u201cLuc\u00eda\u201d. And it turns out that Luc\u00eda only really feels calm and happy in the company of her grandmother and her bees, of which there are, significantly, many different sorts. But there are troubles ahead when a family christening looms at which Luc\u00eda and the other children are expected to wear special formal clothes and Luc\u00eda will want to wear a dress. Heartsinkingly, Luc\u00eda even asks if she can die and be born again as a girl.Ane does not wish to deny Luc\u00eda\u2019s gender identity, although it is never exactly phrased in these terms, but she has concerns, and her husband worries that it is too early to be thinking like this in the first place. But Ane has identity issues of her own: her identity as an artist. Over the summer she wants to work on sculpture projects in the workshop that her late father used, and it is clear that this is a subject of some pain to her mother, because Ane\u2019s father became notorious in the locality for taking naked photographic studies of young girls. And her grandmother, calmly content to use Luc\u00eda\u2019s female pronouns, tells Ane not to \u201cturn a blind eye\u201d to Luc\u00eda\u2019s wishes in the same way that she turned a blind eye to what was happening with her husband.There is food for thought in that analogy. And the confrontation between Ane and her mother over the value of Ane\u2019s vocation as an artist has, in its way, a sharply human dramatic point that the rest of the movie perhaps does not. But it is a warm and generously performed film. 20,000 Species of Bees screened at the Berlin film festival and is released on 27 October in UK cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema.","288":"Like so many young artists, film-maker Nira Burstein has taken the advice to write \u2013 or in this case, film \u2013 what she knows, so for her first feature she\u2019s turned the camera on her own family, a troubled brood from the outer suburbs of New York City. Although Nira holds the camera herself for much of the time, she edits in home movie footage from many years ago which shows how dramatically time and stress have worn the family down.The Burstein patriarch Uri is definitely a character, either the film\u2019s villain, comic relief or hero depending on where you stand. A former realtor and part-time guitarist, he wears a yarmulke most of the time and invokes his Jewish religious beliefs as an excuse when he doesn\u2019t want to attend the wedding of his daughter Adina, Nira\u2019s sister, to two non-binary people with whom she\u2019s decided to form a lasting throuple. Uri\u2019s wife Raya, a former musician herself, earned a master\u2019s from Columbia and once practised as an occupational therapist. But around the time that eldest daughter Judy, variously diagnosed with Tourette syndrome and obsessive compulsive disorder, became \u201csick\u201d with unspecified problems, Raya also had a breakdown and checked into a psychiatric facility. Professionals, according to Raya and Uri, have labelled her bipolar or schizophrenic, but Uri at least is less interested in clinical diagnoses than with how to cope with Raya and Judy\u2019s behaviours and complains about them constantly. (He notes that even celebrity physician\/neurologist Oliver Sacks examined Judy and couldn\u2019t tell what exactly was wrong with her.)Whatever the clinical backstory, this is one very dysfunctional family. Long-held resentments are never more than a millimetre under the surface and a general lack of routine or ability to cope means Uri and Raya live in squalor, with dirty dishes, clutter and cat poo in every room. Mira\u2019s non-judgmental, affectionate view of them has tenderness and an eye for their absurdities; it\u2019s impossible not to see parallels with Grey Gardens, another film about an eccentric family living with cats in the greater New York metropolitan conurbation. That said, Burstein doesn\u2019t yet have the same film-making instincts as the Maysles brothers, and this family seems a lot more unhappy than the daffy Beales of Grey Gardens which makes for depressing viewing. Charm Circle is released on 24 February in cinemas.","289":"This 1970 film from Brazilian director Glauber Rocha is an avant-gardist adventurethat offers us a theatre of absurdity and a theatre of cruelty of an obviously Godardian sort, and Rocha arguably had quite as much sense of composition and camera movement as Godard. (Rocha actually has a cameo in a film Godard worked on, Wind From the East, in which a woman with a movie camera approaches him and says: \u201cExcuse me for interrupting your class struggle, but could you please point me the way towards political cinema?\u201d)The Lion Has Seven Heads is a denunciation of imperialism and an essay in revolutionary thinking that is very much of its time. Opinions may divide now about exactly how well this film has aged; certainly, there is bit of posturing, and the casual use of \u201cMarlene\u201d (Rada Rassimov) \u2013 a naked blond woman writhing around and being variously pawed, harangued and imprisoned \u2013 as a symbol of colonial desire shows how very male leftist political cinema could be.The title refers to the seven-headed beast of the Book of Revelation, symbolising perhaps the earthly oppressive forms of power deployed by the antichrist: kings, consuls, dictators, magistrates, tribunes, emperors and potentates (although of course any amount of exegesis is possible). Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud plays a white-robed preacher striding and declaiming with surreal strangeness across the landscape of Congo-Brazzaville. A weirdly detached, choric figure, he meets a Congolese revolutionary with whom he appears to make common cause, a guerrilla fighter and a bourgeois local politician who is being controlled by outside forces, including the CIA.The film proceeds in a series of bizarre and startling tableaux, often composed in such a way that everyone is addressing the camera head-on. Nonprofessional Congolese dancers and people are used, performing in the background to stylised and contrived situations in front of the camera. The use of the local people in this film is something else that jars a little now in its not-so-subtle condescension, particularly the rather crass mock execution scene. In fact the film itself is a kind of outsider incursion.But The Lion Has Seven Heads has its own fierce, mad conviction, a bad dream being reconstructed by actors after the event \u2013 and the film itself has historical value. This was a time when revolution and the purported inevitability of revolutionary violence was a live issue on the left, and this film engaged with these troubling ideas. The Lion Has Seven Heads is available on 27 February on Mubi.","290":"This gentle, authentic-feeling coming-of-age drama from Ukrainian film-maker Kateryna Gornostai premiered at the Berlin festival in 2021. Released in the UK almost a year to the day since the Russian invasion, her film has become unbearably poignant. It follows a class of 16-year-olds over the course of a single winter: nothing major happens; they hang out, drink a fair bit, party a little, grapple with sexuality and mental health. Actually, the loveliest thing about the film is how it keeps them all safe. They are nice kids; we leave them with everything to live for.At times it feels like we\u2019re watching a documentary. The actors seem so relaxed and intimate \u2013 like actual classmates who\u2019ve grown up together over the years, and who know each other inside out. The main focus is Masha (Maria Fedorchenko), a hunch-shouldered shy girl with huge eyes and cropped Mia Farrow hair. Masha is a bit of an outsider in class, but she\u2019s confident with her friends Yana (Yana Isaienko) and Senia (Arsenii Markov), an absolute sweetheart. Everyone thinks Senia is gay; he\u2019s OK with that.The film is so light on its feet, and feels so effortless. Adding to the fly-on-wall texture, there\u2019s some talking-head-style interviews \u2013 shot as if a film-maker has come into school to speak to the kids about life\u2019s biggies: love, friendship, hopes and dreams. This is at the end of the school year in summer, as swifts shriek in the background (a reminder, perhaps, of how fleetingly special this moment of adolescence is).Watching the film now, a scene in the school\u2019s basement is incredibly sad. The class troops in for \u201cpre-conscription training\u201d \u2013 a solider teaches them how to load and shoot a rifle. They\u2019re mostly giggling, no clue of what\u2019s to come. In real life, two of the cast and crew have been killed by war: the production designer and one of the adult actors. Most of the teenagers are now living abroad. Director Kateryna Gornostai has been volunteering in a community kitchen in Kyiv. I really hope she gets the chance to make another film. Stop-Zemlia is available on 23 February on Klassiki.","291":"Thirty years on, the Bosnian war still has the power to horrify, with its genocidal massacres and concentration camps in the heart of Europe even as international leaders solemnly avowed their determination never to repeat the nightmare of the second world war. Even now, cultural commentators call the 1990s the \u201cSeinfeld decade\u201d where nothing happened, disregarding the carnage in former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.Nenad Cicin-Sain\u2019s music documentary gives us an unofficial, unlicensed look at the nightmare of Sarajevo and the way that rock music kept humanity and hope alive: the rough-and-ready gigs and discos happening in Sarajevo\u2019s battered garages and bomb shelters, while war raged above. It also tells the story of a maverick American journalist and film-maker called Bill Carter, a member of the ragtag expat group of aid workers, musicians and artists in Sarajevo, who was electrified by the sight of U2\u2019s Bono on MTV talking about the Bosnian war. With extraordinary persistence, Carter got an interview with Bono for Bosnian TV, induced the band to do live TV linkup interviews on stage with Bosnian people during their colossal Zoo TV Tour and finally inspired the band to mount a giant concert in Sarajevo in 1997 supported by local bands and a Muslim women\u2019s choir, after the Dayton Accords peace agreement. People interviewed here believe that the Bosnian war only properly ended when Bono took to the stage and yelled: \u201cFuck the past, kiss the future!\u201dOf course, it isn\u2019t that simple. The globalist grandiloquence of U2 is always in danger of looking naive. But the documentary is an interesting reminder that it is precisely that naive, ahistorical, ungrownup quality of rock music, its youth, its (arguable) callowness, its idealism, which is what made it so potent and so inclusive. And Bono himself, a man who has \u2013 in the Scots phrase \u2013 no small opinion of himself, was the guy to make it happen: he had the audacity and the imagination. There were limits to what he could do during the war itself, and the Sarajevo people themselves began to suspect that their pain was being used as set-dressing for U2\u2019s tour; it caused a temporary rift in the love affair between the band and the Bosnians. But U2 became an important part of keeping the world focused on the Bosnian war when plenty of influential people on the left and right were in favour of forgetting all about them. And music reminded Sarajevans that they were human and they had a way of defying the carnage.Perhaps there was no place in this documentary to say it, but it\u2019s important to realise just how much the word \u201cSarajevo\u201d scared the geopolitical classes: the thought that intervention would risk replaying August 1914. As it turned out, one reason why western military activity was thinkable was that Russia was too demoralised by the collapse of communism to respond in the interest of its traditional ally: the Serbs.Which brings us to what that future was which everyone kissed in that huge and euphoric U2 concert in Sarajevo. The grim answer is obvious before the film explicitly raises it in a final TV news montage. Serbia\u2019s president Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 provided a model of belligerent ethnic fascism and land-grabbing tyranny that is now written large by Vladimir Putin. One interviewee says that a Bono\/Sarajevo concert is needed again, but the thought that it can only be staged after the war is over must give us pause. This movie is a time-capsule of Europe\u2019s recent tragic past. Kiss the Future screened at the Berlin film festival.","292":"For a horror film about the terror of demonic possession, Gabriel Bier Gislason\u2019s feature-film debut is unexpectedly charming. Having fallen in love after an adorable meet-cute, Danish has-been performer Maja (Josephine Park) impulsively moves in with Jewish academic Leah (Ellie Kendrick), who suffers from a mysterious injury. Their romance is watched over by Leah\u2019s ultra-Orthodox mother, Chana (The Killing\u2019s Sofie Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l), who fusses over Leah\u2019s every need with an insistence that borders on possessiveness.The awkward interactions that spring out of this clash between an overbearing parent and a gentile outsider are portrayed with that entertaining dry humour of classic Jewish comedy, yet there are also darker forces at play. As Maja bumbles through a series of cultural faux-pas \u2013 imagine frying bacon for your Jewish hookup! \u2013 she also comes across strange clues, like small piles of salt strategically sprinkled around Leah\u2019s flat. Is Chana actually nursing Leah back to health or is she manipulating her daughter through black magic?The deftness with which Gislason balances the conventions of the comedy of manners with the paranoia of navigating a closed community makes Attachment especially compelling. There\u2019s an emotionally complex performance from Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l, and David Dencik is also hugely charismatic as Leah\u2019s uncle Lev, as hilariously deadpan as he is enigmatic.Compared to the engaging script, which is steeped in Jewish folklore and superstitions surrounding malicious spirits called dybbuks, the visuals are flatter and generic: some indoor sequences have such low lighting that it\u2019s difficult to make out what\u2019s happening. Still, the refreshing \u2013 and rare \u2013 blend of Jewish humour and horror makes Attachment a fun Valentine\u2019s Day watch for those who like their queer romance with a sprinkle of spooky chill. Attachment is available on Shudder.","293":"If All the Beauty and the Bloodshed, the recent documentary featuring photographer Nan Goldin, has whetted your appetite for the scuzzy glory days of Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side in the 1970s and 80s, then this documentary about Edward Brezinski, another artist kicking around the Bowery at the time, will quench that thirst. Interestingly, Goldin is never mentioned in this film, but a few art-world figures such as actor-critic Cookie Mueller and artist David Wojnarowicz overlap both films. No doubt there must have gallery openings or parties where Brezinski and Goldin were in the same room or even met one another, and this work clearly demonstrates that the NYC art scene was a small, almost incestuous circle where nearly everyone slept with everyone, especially before Aids arrived, and they all bitched about each other constantly.There is indeed a lot of bitching in the early part of Make Me Famous from those who remember Brezinski, a talented, ambitious painter from Michigan who rocked up to the East Village in the late 70s, yet never achieved the fame of contemporaries such as Jean-Michel Basquiat or Keith Haring. Not for lack of trying, it seems. One interviewee here cattily recalls how Brezinski, who ran a tiny gallery out of his own apartment on the sixth floor of a dilapidated building on East 3rd Street opposite a homeless shelter for men, would hand out cards advertising his shows at other people\u2019s openings \u2013 a grave violation of the codes of cool.A few are fonder of him, including artist David McDermott who was Brezinski\u2019s lover. They recollect him as quite charming but a perfectionist, who would get models to sit all day for him while he painted, and then rub out the result if he wasn\u2019t happy with it. For most of his life Brezinski was dirt poor and when he did get money he immediately spent it on oil paint. His work, so much in the tradition of German expressionism that he was later included in a posthumous show at MOMA about American expressionists, is indeed striking but admittedly not outstandingly so. It\u2019s therefore understandable that, when he died in 2007, his obituaries mostly mentioned his great acts of notoriety: eating a doughnut covered in resin that was part of an art work by Robert Gober, and throwing a glass of wine at art dealer Annina Nosei at a party.Director Brian Vincent and his producer Heather Spore appear on camera as they go in search of Brezinski\u2019s past, accompanied towards the end by charming ageing scenesters Marguerite Van Cook and James Romberger who travel with the film-makers to Cannes to see where Edward died, or indeed find out if he\u2019s definitely dead. As a narrative, it gets a bit repetitive by the time we get to France, but the abundance of home video footage from back in the day, and campy dirt-dishing from the interviewees, makes for a touching look at halcyon period in New York history, before the last shabby corners of Manhattan were gentrified beyond all recognition. Make Me Famous is released on 17 February in UK cinemas.","294":"There are echoes of the Turpin case and Josef Fritzl\u2019s basement in this tense arthouse horror shot in grainy 16mm with auteurish confidence by first-time film-maker Corey Deshon. It opens with a claim to be \u201cmore based on fact than fiction\u201d, but actually tells an entirely fictional story about the kidnapping of a young woman (Vivien Ng\u00f4) who wakes up shackled to the floor in a garage. In front of her stands a man known only as Father (Casper Van Dien). You can tell instantly from his plaid checked shirt, beige slacks and straight-backed posture that he\u2019s the type of Christian you don\u2019t mess with in a horror movie: wholesome looking, but unhinged.\u201cWe\u2019re not violent people,\u201d Father tells the chained-up woman, sounding almost reasonable. It\u2019s not true. In a disturbing, disorientating scene over the opening credits we\u2019ve just watched him in a gas mask chase down another young woman and bludgeon her to death. This new woman is her replacement, kidnapped by Father to be a big sister to his son, Brother (Ian Alexander), a frail boy of about 11. Brother has been raised in isolation, taught that air in the outside world is toxic. Rounding off the creepy family is Mother played with brilliant slyness by Elyse Dinh: is she a quietly submissive wife, or just giving a good performance?At points I wondered if this is a film that tells us anything about anything. Some of its ideas feel a bit thrown together. There are no firm clues as to Father\u2019s motives: he comes across as a man who\u2019d like to have been an authoritarian cult leader if only he had the necessary charisma. But other characters feel a bit under-written \u2013 particularly Brother, who we sense is eager to please his dad, and possibly his successor. Daughter is released on 20 February on digital platforms.","295":"In Jean-Paul Sartre\u2019s No Exit, three dead strangers find themselves locked in a room for eternity, famously giving us that line about hell being other people. Riffing on the idea, Mali Elfman\u2019s debut feature follows two strangers trapped in a car, alive but with death not far off on the horizon.Elfman\u2019s film kicks off with an intriguing premise: science has conclusively proven the existence of an afterlife; death is not the end. The brilliant scientist-entrepreneur behind the discovery is Dr Stevenson, played by Karen Gillan channelling Elizabeth Holmes energy, with a surprisingly deep voice and a slash of bright red lipstick. Disappointingly we only see her in a handful of clips: a few slick media appearances and recorded messages for her institute, Life Beyond.The main focus here is the two people thrown together for the hell of a five-day road trip with a stranger, from New York to the Life Beyond in San Francisco. Both have signed up as volunteers for euthanasia in the name of research. Rose (Katie Parker) is a woman with her finger constantly hovering above the self-destruct button; exhausted, done with self-hatred and shame. English actor Rahul Kohli gives a super likable performance as Teddy, her travelling companion, who loftily explains that he wants to contribute to science with his death, to leave his mark on the world. The truth is that he\u2019s filled with middle-age dread and failure. Rose and Teddy can\u2019t stand each other \u2013 so obviously, it\u2019s love.The movie begins well as a high-concept indie. This new evidence of an afterlife has a destabilising effect on society: suicides and homicides are skyrocketing; violent robberies are down (since people are no longer scared of dying). But then a romance plotline gets muddled into this what-if dystopian sci-fi tale. After that it cops out, becoming a fairly average road-trip movie about redemption with love as the answer to life\u2019s meaninglessness. Next Exit is released on 20 February on digital platforms.","296":"This documentary opens with newsreel footage of concentration camp survivors arriving by boat in Sweden in 1945 \u2013 they are mostly women, smiling and waving at the camera. Director Magnus Gertten explains that he\u2019s spent years trying to put names to the faces. One is a Dutch socialist and feminist who returned to Amsterdam after the war to her women\u2019s health clinic; another a 16-year-old Jewish girl from Poland with a beautiful smile who does not yet know that she is the only survivor in her family. Finally, the face of a Chinese woman, not smiling, but fixing the camera with an intense stare.This last is Nadine Hwang, born into privilege in Madrid, the daughter of China\u2019s ambassador to Spain and a Belgian mother. The reason behind Nadine\u2019s intense expression is that she does not yet know the fate of the woman she fell in love with at the Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp: a French opera singer called Q. They were separated when Nelly was transferred to the Mauthausen camp.With his tender, gentle-going film Gertten tells their love story. It unfolds from the perspective of Nelly\u2019s granddaughter Sylvie Bianchi as she excavates the boxes of photos and diaries left by her grandmother, piecing it all together. Luckily, Nelly did survive the camps \u2013 but only just, after contracting dysentery. She\u2019d been a spy for the French resistance and was arrested by the SS while on a singing tour in 1944. Nadine, who had moved from Beijing to Paris in the 1930s, was imprisoned for helping people flee the Nazis across the Pyrenees to Spain. After the war, the two women were reunited and emigrated to Venezuela with Nelly\u2019s daughter. They spent the rest of their lives together.The film gives us a precious glimpse into LGBTQ+ life in the postwar period. Nadine was a wonderful photographer; her snaps and Super 8 films capture the couple\u2019s glamorous, intimate parties at home in Caracas with their gay friends \u2013 \u201cthe boys\u201d \u2013 drinking champagne and looking fabulous. In one they lightly caress each other\u2019s fingers, Nadine in a beautifully tailored men\u2019s suit, Nelly as gorgeous as a movie star.From their time in the camp, Nelly\u2019s diaries, miraculously, survive; they are written in pencil, the prose harrowing and haunting. Later, Nelly and Nadine edited and typed up the diaries for publication. A little naively, Nelly\u2019s granddaughter wonders why this lesbian love story was rejected for publication in the postwar years. Surely now a publisher will snap it up pronto.Nelly and Nadine is released on 10 February at Bertha DocHouse, London.","297":"Olivia (Madelaine Petsch, a regular from streaming series Riverdale) is a senior at an exclusive all-girls high school in an unidentified but posh-looking US suburb. Clearly hothoused from a young age by her bougie parents, Olivia\u2019s one burning, all-consuming ambition is to get into Stanford University. To that end, she has turned herself into hard-working, top-stream student, captain of the debating society and all that jazz. She has even bought sweatshirts with the name Stanford emblazoned across the chest. But she has checked the numbers and knows that the admissions board will probably only take two or three students from her school, so there is a lot of unspoken tension between her and other students who want to attend this vastly expensive west coast university.That produces horrible pressure for these young minds, and as the film starts, one of Olivia\u2019s best friends, Jane (Chloe Yu), has killed herself for reasons never quite made clear. When a new girl at school (Nina Bloomgarden) threatens Olivia\u2019s supremacy of the debating society, Olivia vents about it to her old friend Izzy (singer Chl\u00f6e Bailey), also once a friend of Jane\u2019s. Olivia and Izzy discover they have access via an old laptop to Jane\u2019s account on a (fictional) social media platform, so they start using this ghost account to throw shade on Olivia\u2019s rival, humiliate a teacher they don\u2019t like, and so on. But it starts to feel as if the account is being controlled by some supernatural force, and Olivia imagines she can see Jane everywhere.Director Sabrina Jaglom, who co-wrote the screenplay with Rishi Rajani, taps into an interesting species of female neurosis turned toxic, as if she is making a mashup of Heathers, Election and Roman Polanski\u2019s Repulsion. She ambitiously opts to keep it ambiguous throughout as to whether Olivia is losing her sanity, legitimately haunted or the instigator of a problem that she can\u2019t control. The ending doesn\u2019t resolve anything neatly or even satisfyingly, but there is a palpable, platonic chemistry between Petsch and Bailey as best friends turned frenemies that is authentically compelling. And it is refreshing to see a film focus so much on the complex intricacies of female relationships but that has nothing to do with sex, either between the young women themselves or with men, who barely feature here. Jane is released on 13 February on digital platforms.","298":"Irish film-maker Treasa O\u2019Brien has created a valuable and empathic documentary essay project about history, memory and community; it is executive produced by The Act of Killing\u2019s Josh Oppenheimer, whose influence is detectable in one verbatim-cinema-type \u201cdream re-enactment\u201d scene (although I must say that this is the one creative avenue that doesn\u2019t really go anywhere).Town of Strangers is set in the town of Gort in County Galway, perhaps best known for being the site of Coole House, the home of Lady Gregory and the Irish literary revival of Yeats, Synge, O\u2019Casey and Shaw. None of that is mentioned, however: O\u2019Brien focuses on its 21st-century distinction of having Ireland\u2019s highest percentage of migrants. O\u2019Brien auditions for people to come and be involved in her documentary, and these \u201caudition\u201d scenes evolve into being the central part of the film itself: where people simply talk about their lives, where they\u2019ve come from and what they expect of Gort. We hear from Brazilian people, Syrian people, Afghan people, Irish Travellers and English hippies.This film is an invigorating, refreshing experience because of its clear-sighted compassion and lack of parochialism, its interest in other people from other cultures, without these impulses being problematised in any way. I have to say that I liked this movie almost in spite of the way it supposedly shapeshifts and genre-straddles between fiction and documentary as the marketing suggests; in fact, I don\u2019t think it does. Despite some shots of the director doing local radio interviews about the way her film is going, it isn\u2019t as meta as all that: its force lies in the simple candour of her interviewees. As films have so often in the past, Town of Strangers proves that there is great cinematic impact in the simple spectacle of people talking about themselves. Town of Strangers is released on 10 February in cinemas.","299":"Here is a revival of a 1983 film from the Georgian director Eldar Shengelaia (still alive at 90) and it is revealed as an intriguing, and perhaps even remarkable creation: a dapper, droll satire on Soviet bureaucracy, a shaggy dog story of absurd humour that creeps up on you, culminating in a truly bizarre apocalypse. The satire was arguably lenient enough to get the film made and lenient enough to win it the USSR State prize, but we can see from our 2023 vantage point that it is a deadpan prophecy of the Soviet Union\u2019s imminent collapse. If we could go back in time to this film\u2019s first release and tell Shengelaia that just six years later the Berlin Wall would come down and with it the entire Soviet system, would he have been surprised? Perhaps only about the fact that it was going to take so long.The scene is a state publishing company that also supervises printing and takes delivery of noisome chemicals in its basement courtyard. A would-be writer called Soso (Ramaz Giorgobiani) is scurrying about the building, desperately trying to interest its harassed or indolent functionaries in his novel, entitled Tian Shan, or The Blue Mountains \u2013 and therefore, we must assume, literally or metaphorically about the central Asian mountain ranges, although no one ever asks him about it or discusses literary matters in any way. No one definitively rejects him or accepts him. He is always referred to someone else.A sad, lonely man called Markscheider (Ivane Sakvarelidze), wearing a belted mac and hat like Peter Cook\u2019s EL Wisty, is also hanging about, trying to interest people in his allegorical fables. Markscheider manages to fix the office\u2019s broken lift \u2013 it is only when they are stranded in the frequently immobile lift that executives read manuscripts \u2013 and someone comes close to offering him a job through sheer gratitude. But not to publishing him. Another grumpy official rages at the fact that a painting of Greenland\u2019s frozen landscape, insecurely tacked up over his desk, may come crashing down at any moment and kill him, but he cannot get the bureaucratic authority to remove it.This painting is, in fact, all he cares about; he certainly doesn\u2019t care about literature, but then no one else does either. Another apparatchik is obsessed with the games of motorbike polo happening outside the building, and many employees spend their time gazing poignantly out of the window at the city in all its purposeful busy-ness, so different from their own near-coma of inactivity. And all the time the cracks in the walls are getting worse. It leads to an uproarious climax, delivered in the same elegantly inscrutable style as the rest of the comedy. What an intriguing and brilliant insight into the late Soviet mindset. Blue Mountains is available on 9 February on Klassiki.","300":"As a Dr Martens-wearing teenager in the 90s, I loathed the anarchist indie band Chumbawamba and their chart-topping anthem Tubthumping. (What a bunch of jokers, I thought.) Well, I take it all back after watching this funny and surprisingly sweet documentary co-directed by frontman Dunstan Bruce and Sophie Robinson. It begins with Bruce, now in his late 50s, overwhelmed by feelings of powerlessness as he thinks about the future of the planet, wondering what he can do (\u201cI\u2019m a washed up, rinsed out retired radical\u201d). As a film-maker he indulges in a bit of wallowing here: taking the negative voice in his head and bringing it to life, played by an actor wearing a papier-mache head, who sarkily takes the piss out of him.But from here the film settles nicely into an enjoyable blast of pop history. Chumbawamba started out as an anarchist collective in Leeds in 1982: living together in a squat, they went vegan (\u201cI\u2019m from Burnley! I didn\u2019t like vegetables\u201d), shared money equally and took it in turns to do the cooking. They\u2019d been going for years when Tubthumping topped the charts. With a worldwide smash hit on their hands, the band decided that here was an opportunity to do something positive \u2013 to be a political band inside the belly of popular culture. They gave a lot of the money they made away, and in 1998 at the Brit awards, singer Danbert Nobacon poured a bucket of cold water over deputy prime minister John Prescott, furious at the Labour government\u2019s treatment of Liverpool dockers.Chumbawamba were massive in America, and did the talkshow circuit. (\u201cIf you can\u2019t afford our music, steal it,\u201d said bandmate Alice Nutter on late night TV.) In the present day, Bruce interviews their big time American record label boss from that period, who says none of it changed a thing. No one was listening to the political message. \u201cIt went largely over everyone\u2019s head.\u201d That\u2019s what\u2019s so unusual about I Get Knocked Down: it has a streak of humility utterly foreign to most music documentaries. Bruce puts in the bits every other band on the planet would leave out. That includes a montage from the 90s of music critics slagging off Chumbawamba. (\u201cThey\u2019re not very good pop stars and they\u2019re not very good political activists either,\u201d is the damning verdict of a young Caitlin Moran.)Chumbawamba split up in 2012. They\u2019re still mates and come across here as extremely likable, not taking themselves at all too seriously. Scenes of them nattering together, having a giggle now, are lovely. So too are the end credits featuring clips from YouTube of ordinary people singing Tubthumping \u2013 everyone finding power and defiance in the song, from Christian choirs to heavy metal bands and small kids. I Get Knocked Down is released on 4 February in UK cinemas.","301":"In 2004 a collection of photographs was discovered at a flea market in Manhattan. They depicted what we now know to be life at Casa Susanna (BBC Four), a bungalow camp in upstate New York that served as a resort for cross-dressing men, often accompanied by their wives. In the years since those pictures turned up, there has been a Casa Susanna book, an exhibition, a play \u2013 and now this feature-length documentary, which goes deeper into the stories of a handful of those who were there.This is a charming film with a big, open heart. Casa Susanna was established by Tito Valenti, a court translator who went by Susanna when dressed as a woman, and his wife, Maria, who owned a wig shop in Manhattan. When Maria is described by her grandson Gregory, she sounds utterly wonderful. The resort offered its patrons \u201ctotal freedom\u201d to dress as they wished. For many, it was the first time they had met anyone like them.Two now-elderly women, Katherine and Diana, spent time there in the 1960s; they return to the site and recall what it meant to them, as well as describing their lives before and after they visited. At the time they identified as transvestites or cross-dressers, though both have since transitioned. The language used around sexuality, sex and gender here may sound old-fashioned to a modern ear, but the film is guided by its interviewees\u2019 descriptions of themselves and their friends, and has a robust complexity that gives it an honest and occasionally painful sheen. For example, we learn that this was a place for \u201ccross-dressing men who were exclusively heterosexual\u201d, hence the wives being there. They wanted to distinguish themselves from gay people, as they couldn\u2019t accept what they saw as being two marks against their names.This is a very personal history for Katherine and Diana, who are generous with their life stories; a broad cultural history of gender-nonconformity; and a portrait of a specific time and place. It is a world of classified ads in specialist magazines, placed and answered in the hope of meeting like-minded souls. Diana describes being a small boy and going to sleep wishing she would wake up a girl. There was nobody to talk to about this, or no point of reference to make her feel as if she were less alone. \u201cWhat could be going on with me?\u201d she recalls thinking, bewildered and ashamed. At Casa Susanna the guests played card games and talked about themselves as they had never been able to do before.As with many portraits of queer life in an era of illegality, there is some discussion of shame. Families are tested and strained, and shame sometimes leads to cruelty and broken relationships. The documentary doesn\u2019t flinch away from that, nor does it dwell. It does a matter-of-fact job of exploring the complicated corners, and balances the sadness with joy and celebration. This seems fitting. Pictures of the \u201ctransvestite scene\u201d in the 1960s are understandably rare because people were afraid they might be exposed, arrested or blackmailed if they were discovered. Casa Susanna is brought to life, vibrantly, in those unearthed photographs, and it makes them all the more valuable.Diana looks through old snapshots wondering if they are really her (a couple of them, it turns out, are not). In one of the most moving and sincere moments of this very moving and sincere film, she talks about going to Mexico for what she calls \u201cthe surgery\u201d. On the way home, a friend takes her to visit her parents for the first time as a woman. What follows is a beautiful story about love and, in the end, its limits. This heartwarming anecdote speaks to the goodness and decency of people though, as elsewhere, it does not avoid the rough edges.The film is filled with big characters. A woman named Betsy reads from a book written by her father about his time at Casa Susanna, called A Year Among the Girls; she delves into their relationship and his life with admirable frankness. Gregory serves as a de facto narrator, giving historical context to cross-dressing and transgender women, and fantastic accounts of a childhood that sounds unusual by the standards of society at the time. The end of the film brings them all together in a beautiful, poignant moment of remembering and commemoration.Sign up to What's OnGet the best TV reviews, news and exclusive features in your inbox every Mondayafter newsletter promotionThe Storyville strand is on a roll at the moment. From The Fire Within to Three Minutes: A Lengthening, its documentaries are as fascinating as they are broad. Casa Susanna fits right in. It is a lovely, sad, celebratory story of outsiders finding community, and of people finding themselves. These are human tales of strengths and weaknesses, triumphs and flaws, and they are handled by director S\u00e9bastien Lifshitz with great care and sensitivity.","302":"This sensitive but flawed documentary retells the inspirational story of Michael J Fox, the babyfaced Hollywood star of 80s hits including Back to the Future and TV\u2019s Family Ties, who stunned the showbusiness world in 1998 by announcing his Parkinson\u2019s diagnosis. It was a condition he had kept secret for seven years, having controlled it with medication and cleverly masked it on screen with his hyperactive high-energy tics, tricks and mannerisms, until the condition had deteriorated too far.The film takes us through some of his moments from the TV comedy Spin City \u2013 his final TV gig prior to going public with the diagnosis \u2013 and, heartwrenchingly, you can see how the symptoms were beginning to show. It\u2019s an arresting watch, although in addition to dramatic reconstructions of his childhood, film-maker Davis Guggenheim has a cutesy-ironic habit of using clips from Fox\u2019s movies themselves to dramatise key moments in Fox\u2019s life: an unnecessary, distracting and slightly naive approach, eliding the public and private personae.Guggenheim interviews Fox and shows his daily life with his family and his personal trainer-therapist; his tremors are far more obvious when he is walking the streets than when he is sitting down talking. We also see Fox\u2019s activism, persuading the political establishment to invest more in Parkinson\u2019s research. In tune with the actor\u2019s natural magnanimity, the movie does not mention the way blowhard commentator Rush Limbaugh had to apologise in 2006 for accusing Fox of exaggerating his symptoms or deliberately going off his meds for a pro-Democrat TV spot. And unlike his autobiography Lucky Man, the film does no more than hint at the sexual success that Fox enjoyed as a young star before meeting his wife, Tracy Pollan. (He memorably wrote that women who once wouldn\u2019t give him the time of day now invited him to read it off their bedside clocks.)Fox is a thoroughly likable man, utterly without self-pity, but perhaps also without reflection: sometimes Guggenheim has to press him on how he never says he\u2019s in pain. It could be that his natural upbeat style is his survival mechanism.What emerges from this film is how funny Fox is: the movies themselves don\u2019t tell you that as clearly as his work on TV comedy in front of a studio audience. There is also something glorious about his rags-to-riches life story when young Fox, living in poverty in LA as a wannabe actor, first breaks up the room with his audition for the sitcom Family Ties. (He was also reliably funny doing talkshows or accepting awards.)Perhaps Fox and the film itself don\u2019t quite put us inside his anguish at first getting the diagnosis and then his decision to go public, but his courage is the more moving for being understated. And there is a piercingly bleak moment when he says that his illness felt real to him in a way that success didn\u2019t. I wish that his early life could have been told more simply without those ironised faux-biog clips, but this is a highly watchable and affecting film.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotion Still: A Michael J Fox Movie screened at the Sundance film festival, and is released on 12 May in cinemas and on Apple TV+.","303":"Those interested in the concept of rewilding, a form of environmental conservation that seeks to restore land to a more natural state as popularised by the book by Isabella Tree, should be well advised that this film has nothing to do with that. Rather, it is an almost endearingly amateurish package, written and directed by Ric Rawlins, that is an exercise in something that\u2019s almost as fashionable these days: folk horror. There\u2019s lashings of folk horror about these days, some of it, like Enys Men, very good. Rewilding, however, is not very good, if we are being honest. But it\u2019s as folky as you get, telling three disconnected stories set in the West Country and Wales revolving around such folky elements as spooky coastal caves, trees that might once have been men, and Wicker Man-esque rituals in tiny villages. Plus, there\u2019s ersatz folk music on its soundtrack (some of it written by Rawlins himself), folk acting (as in really, really poor acting by non-professionals), and even folk editing and folk cinematography, which elevate inexperience and poor craftsmanship into an aesthetic in itself. The whole thing is very outsider cinema.Rewilding could be fun if it were either a little more inept or a little more competent, but instead it\u2019s a bit of a chore. The first story, Stone Mothers, finds an unlucky archaeologist (John Matthews) investigating reports of the devil inside a sea cave accessible only at low tide. It gets bonus points for well-researched locations, but you have to take those back for having a protagonist so dim he never thinks to make a note of the tides, or even just install a handy app. The Family Tree finds a writer (Natasha Neckles) booking an Airbnb in a village so she can write about local trees, and finding one that bleeds and has human eyes looking through bore holes \u2013 at least, in her dreams.The final chapter, The Writers Enquiry, lacks correct punctuation in its title and any sense of logic in its ending, but at least lead Richard Chivers is a semi-competent performer, howling with energetic, almost-believable terror in the last minutes. His character is supposed to be a local reporter trying to gather ghost stories in a picturesque village for a paper that\u2019s about to go bust. Really, hasn\u2019t local journalism suffered enough already? Rewilding is available on now on Prime Video.","304":"It\u2019s only been a couple of months since Jonah Hill won over audiences with Stutz, his sharp and surprisingly stirring documentary about his therapist, Phil Stutz. The actor is back with another contribution to the Netflix canon, this one an unfortunate monument to the unexamined life.Hill stars in, co-produced and co-wrote You People with Black-ish creator Kenya Barris. Strong as its streetwear and soundtrack game may be, the project lacks the discipline or specificity that makes a romantic comedy pop. Instead we have an updated yet out-of-date revisit of Guess Who\u2019s Coming to Dinner by way of Meet The Parents. A nice Jewish boy and a nice Black girl like each other. A lot. And there\u2019s the premise for the screenplay, a smorgasbord of time-killing and wannabe edgy jokes that dives headstrong into stereotypes. The whole enterprise strains to milk a relatively NBD situation for all the WTF it can.Here\u2019s the concept, if you can call it that: Ezra (Hill) and Amira (Lauren London), meet when Ezra mistakes a woman in an idling car for his Uber driver. Amira is an underemployed costume designer on her way to a job interview, and she calls racism. The two spar, then manage to crack each other up. The two share a passion for sneakers and hip-hop \u2013 and soon, each other. Goodbye, loneliness! Hello, matching streetwear outfits! It\u2019s sheer bliss. And then \u2026 their parents enter the picture.Ezra\u2019s folks, Arnold and Shelley, are a pair of meddling Jews (David Duchovny and Julia Louis-Dreyfus, two of the many heavyweights in this star-studded, and star-crossed cast). They are elated when they meet their son\u2019s new girlfriend, who is beautiful and patient and \u2026 it\u2019s hard to say what else. Shelley is a virtue-signaling, challah-serving Jewish mom with a flair for putting her foot in her mouth, unable to stop herself from making comments about Black hair and Louis Farrakhan. \u201cOur family is growing in such a cool and hip and funky way!\u201d she exclaims. \u201cWe\u2019re a family of color.\u201dAmira\u2019s parents, Akbar and Fatima (Eddie Murphy and Nia Long), are Black Muslims who also happen to live in the area, all the better to ratchet up the tension. They do not like the cut of Ezra\u2019s jib, which means Shelley\u2019s cloying embrace has a match in Akbar\u2019s incessant razzing of Ezra. He takes the kid who wants to marry his daughter to the Black barber shop, and the basketball court, if only to watch him squirm and renounce his intentions. For her part, Shelley brings Amira to a fancy predominantly white spa.The microaggressions fly, but look past the Holocaust jokes and it\u2019s all too evident that not much is happening beneath the surface. The overarching effect of sitting through You People is not unlike watching a Twitter timeline, staring down a smorgasbord of hot-button issues that come without the satisfaction of a through line. There are gags about vaccines, police brutality, Black Lives Matter and Yom Kippur. There is an elderly orthodontist who offers to examine Ezra\u2019s penis. (To be fair, I cannot say I anticipated that last one.)With high-octane friends like these, you\u2019d think the production could skate by without setting off cringe alarms. Alas, Louis-Dreyfus is unrecognizably one-note, her spunk blotted out, perhaps, by the indignity of playing a central-casting Karen. Duchovny grumbles his way along \u2013 and should be commended for taking a bite of food during a dinner scene where nobody else bothers to pretend to be eating. Mercifully, Murphy adds a dose of sharpness to the project, wrapping his lines in a delivery so sleek and spirited you\u2019d almost think they were funny. And as for the central couple? The one that just wants to get married, culture clash be damned? They\u2019re nice. So nice. Too nice.Their moods are determined by their parents, and it\u2019s both disheartening and not at all surprising that their parents are the ones who engineer the couple\u2019s inevitable late-second-act rupture and third-act redemption. Strong as their shared fondness for tie-dye athleisure may be, the two members of the couple lack agency, and, more unfortunately, an actual connection. It calls back to a moment in Stutz where Hill tells his therapist that he has a disease: \u201cI have to avoid emotion by making jokes.\u201dFor all its insistence that it\u2019s a daring piece of social commentary, You People is, above all, a romance without a beating heart.You People is now available on Netflix","305":"Gentle, friendly, faintly bleary \u2013 and sans makeup \u2013 Pamela Anderson is an authentically likable screen presence in this intimate, if somehow elusive, documentary portrait from Ryan White; it is about her life and times and the super-strength misogyny she has faced from liberals and satirists in the long endgame of her celebrity career. (This, incidentally, is yet another documentary which shows how very badly talkshow monologues can date.)Anderson is interviewed at her lakeside property in Canada, musing wryly and shrewdly about the media, often hanging out on camera with her two grownup sons who are fiercely fond and protective. The movie uses her sweetly innocent diaries and her home videos with badass ex-husband Tommy Lee, from which the notorious sex tape was pirated and sold, helping to fuel the world wide web in its early dial-up era.We are taken through her backstory: her explosively tempered, proto-Tommy dad who was always fighting with her mom, her abuse and rape as a child, her sensational \u201cdiscovery\u201d in the crowd by the jumbotron camera at a football game, her Norma Jeane\/Marilyn transformation into a blonde icon eerily unlike her former un-star self, her Playboy covers, her ascent to global celebrity on TV\u2019s Baywatch, her marriage on the beach to M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce drummer Lee after just four days\u2019 acquaintance. And then the still unsolved theft of the honeymoon sex tape, which made them a global laughing stock, and which many male commentators took as their green light to convert the lechery into hate (but perhaps it was always hate).This documentary shows that she had to contend with obnoxious abuse (including physical abuse) throughout her life. TV comics and pundits thought they were punching up, including the reliably boorish and objectionable Larry King. Anderson is candid about the string of failed marriages and relationships she endured \u2013 although we don\u2019t hear about the one with Jon Peters \u2013 and says they were all a desperate attempt to recapture the rocket-fuelled excitement of that first, gloriously romantic and outrageous wedding to Lee.And as for that sex tape, Pamela angrily says she never made a dime out of it and rejects the theory that she somehow was behind the leaking. I believe her, but I\u2019d like to see some closer questioning of Lee on this point. As for the rest of it, such as her friendship with Julian Assange \u2026 well she hasn\u2019t much to say about that, or if they are still in touch. Her campaign work for Peta? Audacious and admirable, but it isn\u2019t clear if she\u2019s still involved.Anderson finally gets cast in Chicago on Broadway as Roxie Hart and does very well. She\u2019s a really good dancer, and there\u2019s redemption there, of a sort. Will she carry on in musical theatre? That would be a great move: she deserves happiness, and perhaps this would bring it to her. Pamela, A Love Story is released on 31 January on Netflix.","306":"This enjoyable high-octane action spy movie from India is possibly the most fun you can currently have at the cinema \u2013 for the first two hours of its running time at least. At the packed London cinema where I watched it on opening night, the crowd erupted with whoops the moment Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan appeared on screen \u2013 face battered to a pulp, gazing up through a bloody swollen half-shut eye.The film is the latest instalment in the YRF Spy Universe: Khan is Pathaan, a James Bond-ish spy brought out of retirement to take down an international terror organisation known as Outfit X. Its leader is another former Indian spy, Jim (John Abraham), who\u2019s gone rogue, committing atrocities for the likes of Boko Haram and Islamic State in return for cash. Now Jim has got his hands on a biological weapon of mass destruction.The increasingly daft plot pings around the globe like a Bond or Mission: Impossible. Khan delivers a performance with perfect levels of fun, and light on Bond-ish psychological flaws, playing it instead with a wink here, a joke there. (There\u2019s a very funny line about him going to the hairdressers to get a blow dry.) Saying that, Khan clearly takes his training seriously; he\u2019s impossibly ripped, and his personal trainer probably deserves to share his credits and a chunk of his fee here.The film sags a little towards the end, with a few too many implausible action sequences: characters jumping out of helicopters and fighting on top of speeding SUVs, the choreography glossing over the basics of gravity and physics. Still, the cheers kept coming: the loudest whoop of all when Salman Khan made an entrance as Tiger, a hero from an earlier movie in the series. Pathaan is out now in UK cinemas.","307":"During the darkest days of the pandemic, there was a universal hankering for escape, from the grimness of the unendingly awful news and also from our homes, another country suddenly seeming more like another world. When stringent protocols had a financial and logistical impact on production, stories that took place in relatively remote locations with relatively small casts started to propagate. But what\u2019s interesting about so many of them, from The Menu to Glass Onion to Triangle of Sadness to Fall to The White Lotus and now to Infinity Pool, is that the majority end up warping our desire to get away, cautionary tales of death and danger imploring us to stay home in order to survive.Brandon Cronenberg\u2019s thriller of lurid, and at times laughable, extremities takes us to a swish resort in the fictional state of Li Tolqa, an isolated idyll that lures writer James (Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd) with his wife Em (Cleopatra Coleman). His last book was six years ago and he\u2019s hoping to be inspired by the new surroundings. Instead inspiration comes from flirtatious actor Gabi (Mia Goth) and her architect husband Alban (Jalil Lespert) who take James under their wing.You don\u2019t have to be familiar with Goth\u2019s recent fascination with high-pitch horror to know that this is not a couple to be trusted but James is seduced by their freewheeling nature and her wandering hand (an early scene of her masturbating him after he urinates is a shockingly graphic sign of things to come). But questions over fidelity are tabled when a drunk-driving accident sends James and Em to a local jail where an unlikely proposition is suggested. The punishment for the crime is execution but if James can afford it, a clone can be created, with all of his memories as well as his physicality, and he can be killed instead.While Em is traumatised by the sight of her husband\u2019s clone getting enthusiastically stabbed to death (again, shockingly graphic), James is weirdly compelled and finds himself part of a small group of tourists who have also gone through the same experience as him. Their time in Li Tolqa is dominated by hedonistic indulgence, pushing each other to wild levels of depravity and James must figure out how far he\u2019s willing to go.As with his last film, the Andrea Riseborough-starring Possessor, Cronenberg has fostered his father David\u2019s interest in boundary-pushing body horror, pummeling his characters and us with gore and gristle. It\u2019s effectively eye-opening and confidently choreographed but always at a remove, Skarsg\u00e5rd allured a little too quickly into indulging in terrible things. It is interesting to see him continue to trade in his conventional leading man looks for another bizarro role, this one pushing him further than we\u2019ve seen him pushed before, from fighting himself while naked to getting breastfed by Goth, an actor who is again admirably committed, another capitalised go-for-broke performance. It\u2019s not always successful but it\u2019s hard to keep your eyes off her as she slinks her way into chaos.There\u2019s some initial unease over how the locals are portrayed \u2013 as mystical and uncivilised \u2013 but the script soon reveals that it\u2019s the tourists who are the true barbarians, treating their surroundings with callous contempt, the film another addition to the recent string of one-percenter skewering satires. For a film filled with provocative and punishing imagery, it\u2019s remarkable how little of it actually sticks in one\u2019s mind once the credits roll. The \u201cmore is more\u201d approach (hallucinations, orgies, pissing, stabbing, shooting, splitting, piercing etc) is attention-securing in the moment but oddly forgettable after, like waking up from a nightmare you can\u2019t remember. Infinity Pool is too hectic to truly haunt.Infinity Pool premiered at the Sundance film festival and will be released in US cinemas on 27 January and in the UK on 24 March","308":"This pulpy, ultraviolent horror-sci-fi-action whatnot of a film seems to unfold in a post-apocalyptic end-time \u2013 or maybe just a very rough suburb of Los Angeles. It\u2019s hard to tell, nor does it much matter. Whatever the context, this is a world where it\u2019s always night, where colours are so desaturated that everything\u2019s a kind of slushy orangey brown, everybody has unkempt hair or dreads, and the borders between the spirit world and that of the living are somewhat porous.A young man named Voaen (played by martial arts champ DY Sao) arrives to take a night watchman job at a crusty squat which is in fact some sort of asylum for families with sick family members. After introductions to the many and varied residents, Voaen makes doe eyes with Janett (Luciana Faulhaber), a pretty mother with a young wheelchair-using son \u2013 but it\u2019s hard to fathom the depths of their feelings for one another under all that hair. Someone or something is abducting children, so everybody is a bit jumpy. The multi-ethnic cast mention all kinds of deities and theological beliefs, from Hanuman the monkey god to four apocalyptic horseman to someone named Mephisto. The costumes and makeup are similarly elaborate and eclectic, a mixture of armour, nail extensions, decorated beekeeping hats and (the meme of the moment these days) medieval plague doctor masks.Voaen has a near-death experience and discovers that some kind of god\/demonic force is trying to use him as an instrument of its nefarious aims. At the same time, the residents of the asylum are hoping that he can call on his past history of violence (shown in a flurry of fighting flashbacks) to protect the weak. As Voaen tries to perform his rounds at the facility he keeps hearing the subsonic grumble of the demon\u2019s voice which (as far as I can make out in the super-muddy sound mix) are mostly commands to kill \u2013 though maybe it\u2019s a grocery list. Judging by the soundtrack, the shouting and hysteria escalate, but it\u2019s hard to tell what\u2019s going on in all that murk. Shadowy it is indeed, but mastery is more questionable. Shadow Master is released on 30 January on digital platforms.","309":"For all the grand gestures of musical theater, there\u2019s an odd flatness to Theater Camp, a half-hearted and lackluster comedy from a group of Hollywood friends set at a summer performing arts community. There\u2019s the inherited, well-worn genre of the mockumentary, as well as the familiar satirical targets of overzealous and\/or pretentious theater types. But the real remove comes from a script that must\u2019ve seemed much funnier on paper than in practice.The 94-minute film \u201cliterally came out of us just wanting to make something with our friends\u201d, said Molly Gordon, co-director along with her boyfriend Nick Lieberman, after the film\u2019s overhyped Sundance standing ovation. That\u2019s pretty accurate to how it feels to watch Theater Camp \u2013 secondhand comedy, as if sitting in on a friend group\u2019s exchange of inside jokes you\u2019re not privy to, with unoriginal bits that probably kill among their audience but fizzle on screen.Theater Camp, written by Gordon, Lieberman and their friends\/former Evan Hansens\/engaged couple Ben Platt and Noah Galvin, expands upon the group\u2019s 2020 short of the same name. Like the original, it stars Platt and Gordon as daffily over-serious theater camp instructors captured by an unseen documentary crew, this time brought to a bespoke upstate musical arts camp called AdirondACTS. The lakeside community is in turmoil after its cash-strapped matriarch Joan (Amy Sedaris) slips into a strobe-light induced coma at a middle school production of Bye Bye Birdie; her vlogger son Troy (YouTube star Jimmy Tatro), an overdrawn caricature of a social media hypeman, steps in to \u201cen-troy-preneur\u201d the place with zero knowledge of musical theater. (One of the film\u2019s better bits is the camp\u2019s consistent invocation of Joan as a beloved departed spirit when she\u2019s still alive.)The plot loosely orbits around co-dependent best friends Amos (Platt) and Rebecca-Diane\u2019s (Gordon) splintering relationship as they compose an original musical about Joan\u2019s legacy (the film\u2019s best decision, by far, is to show us several minutes of the completed Joan, Still) and Troy\u2019s airheaded attempts to keep the place afloat. There\u2019s a brief side plot involving the ruthless, deadpan board member of the neighboring camp (played by the always funny Patti Harrison) who sees an opportunity for expansion, and the general extra-ness of the camp\u2019s many personalities, including dance instructor Clive (Nathan Lee Graham) and biting costume designer Gigi (Owen Thiele). Galvin is the standout of the adult cast, imbuing a spotlight-yearning \u201cthird-generation stage manager\u201d with anxious heart that has rewarding payoff in the film\u2019s genuinely enjoyable, sentimental musical finale. (Ayo Edebiri, playing to awkward type, also steals the spotlight in a handful of scenes as a completely underqualified local hired to cut costs.)The film-makers appear to have a skewed sense of what would make their film \u2013 a promising premise always ripe for parody \u2013 enjoyable. The most glaring example is the format; the genre of the mockumentary is already overdone, and Theater Camp halfway commits to it in the least helpful way \u2013 the camera is shaky, the edit distractingly jittery and the shots unnecessarily finagled through blinds or door cracks. There\u2019s no fourth-wall breaking or talking heads, which usually provide the zings for this type of set-up. The visual language is generally chaotic and at times incoherent, but not in a way that underscores the playful cacophony of a summer camp. The mismatched aesthetic is further muddled by the film\u2019s desaturated color palette for a grainy, muted texture \u2013 a choice that undermines rather than amplifies the excess of the characters and the general heightened intensity of a musical theater camp for very enthusiastic kids. (For a mockumentary that does elevate the campiness of youth theater and is actually funny, see: High School Musical: The Musical: The Series.)And despite all the star power, I wished the film would focus not on the typically self-obsessed adults \u2013 I enjoy Gordon as a performer, but there\u2019s nothing new in her parody of a seance-y, \u201cenergy-healing\u201d white woman \u2013 but on the numerous talented youth actors seemingly thrilled to be there and all fun to watch. Theater Camp does, at least, reward us at the end with the kids\u2019 performance of Joan, Still, which has all the warm, earnest charm the previous 80 minutes lacked. Easily the best punchline of Theater Camp is that the much-beleaguered, obviously tasteless production of Joan, Still is actually good, in the ridiculous, bad but deeply committed way. It\u2019s not enough to make up for the film around it, but a good reminder of the intense belonging theater camp can evoke, and what a self-aware film about it could\u2019ve been.Theater Camp premiered at the Sundance film festival and is seeking distribution","310":"Here\u2019s a bitter, odd, quirky shaggy-dog ghost story with a wintry chill. Award-winning Bulgarian documentary film-maker Andrey Paounov makes his fiction feature debut with this adaption, along with British co-writer Alex Barrett, from a stage play by Bulgarian author Yordan Radichkov. Two middle-aged men are shivering in a remote snowy hut just on the border of a dark forest full of wolves. They are the Porter (Samuel Finzi) and the Old Man (Iossif Surchadzhiev), and they are \u2026 what? Forest rangers? Officials at a science research station? A third resident, Petar, has gone into town earlier, taking with him the horse-and-sled and his rifle.While Petar is away, a sinisterly threatening man (Zachary Baharov) shows up with another man whose face is obscured by scarves, demanding help with his damaged snow plough. An aggressive priest (Leonid Yovchev) also arrives, demanding to know where Petar is. But then Petar\u2019s horse returns, without Petar, and with a frozen wolf in the back of the sled. One by one, the visitors insist on taking the horse-and-sled through the forest into town, and each time, the horse comes placidly clip-clopping back, with no human there \u2013 just another frozen wolf in the back.This weird little parable looks a bit like a middle-European Pinter, or a sketch of the eastern European mind paralysed by the ghost of Soviet communism. But then it takes a bizarre left-turn, switching from black-and-white to colour, pastiching Kubrick\u2019s The Shining. Why? I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s not a particularly successful idea, and in fact undermines the distinctive identity of the rest of the film. But Paounov maintains the movie\u2019s intense fixity of mood, and the effect is arresting. January is released on 27 January in cinemas and on digital platforms.","311":"Cheap as undercooked chips, this British thriller about elderly ex-soldiers avenging a friend\u2019s death belatedly cashes in on the 2010s trend for \u201cgeri-action\u201d films, to borrow a term coined by Vulture\u2019s Matt Patches. Though less slick, it resembles those American fisticuff- and gunfire-packed thrillers (the Red and Expendables franchises, for example) built around former big-name actors supplementing their pension schemes.Directed by Daniel Zirilli, the film features Nick Moran (still best known for Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels) as the low-profile protagonist, Burton, a former SAS man suffering from PTSD. He gets scooped up on the street by an old acquaintance, American veteran Carver (former Six Million Dollar Man Lee Majors), who has a beef with some gangsters in his London neighbourhood who are trafficking women, selling drugs and, given the age of everyone here, possibly dealing in black market ration cards.When Carver fails to subdue the ruffians, Burton and a cohort of buddies (Ian Ogilvy, Billy Murray and Paul Barber) band together to take out the trash, with assists from nice gangster Sanchez (Danny Trejo), Carver\u2019s politician daughter Judy (Patsy Kensit) and a few cops.At the very least, viewers would expect a little witty banter to pad out the time between action sequences, the latter being typically inept and low-energy. Unfortunately, the dialogue sounds as if it was written by one of those newfangled AI chatbots, or maybe an actual human being who aspires to write as well as an AI chatbot but is not there yet. Renegades is released on 30 January on digital platforms.","312":"Sam Worthington spends lots of time looking intensely glum in Transfusion, matching the tone of the writer\/director Matt Nable\u2019s quietly moody action-drama. You can\u2019t blame the guy: not long ago Worthington was swimming in shimmering oceans on a picturesque planet populated by lanky smurfs. Now, in this sombre Stan original film, Worthington plays Ryan Logan, a former sniper for the Australian Army who is struggling to adjust to normal society. He starts selling wine he knows nothing about before getting in over his head, entangled in a narrative reminiscent of a Liam Neeson B-thriller.The film\u2019s first scene establishes Ryan\u2019s backstory: a mission in Iraq injured him both physically and psychologically. The second provides some father-son camaraderie: Ryan has a very macho bonding scene with eight-year-old Billy (Gilbert Bradman), as the pair hunt for deer. The third reveals Ryan\u2019s softer side, as he hangs out with his pregnant wife Justine (Phoebe Tonkin) and responds to questions from Billy such as: \u201cCan I be brave like you one day?\u201d To be fair, that line reads cheesier than it sounds: this interaction \u2013 the entire film, in fact \u2013 is decently acted, despite some lacklustre scripting.Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningThe key issue with these introductory scenes isn\u2019t the acting, or the direction, but the machine-tooled nature of the writing. You know it\u2019s all a setup to show us what\u2019s important to Ryan before Nable pulls the rug out from under him. When Justine is killed in a car crash early on, the moment feels so rote, so mechanical, that it is robbed of any genuine emotion. Did we just watch a person die, or a page in the script marked \u201cend of prologue\u201d?The narrative jumps ahead: Billy is now 16 (Edward Carmody) and a teenage delinquent. A judge lets him off with a warning, instructing him to keep on the straight and narrow or he\u2019ll be removed from Ryan\u2019s care.Again the setup is obvious: you know the boy is going to get in trouble. And when a former SAS colleague, Johnny (Nable, also acting), comes along offering some easy, albeit illegal, work, you know the opposite is true: working for Johnny is going to be difficult and precarious, and we know Ryan will end up putting everything on the line for himself and his son.In an era of rapidly advancing artificial intelligence, such as the game-changing AI ChatGPT, it\u2019s only a matter of time until we could truly suspect these sorts of paint-by-numbers scripts were spat out by computer \u2013 or that the computer might do a better job.An inevitable mishap involving Billy sends Ryan scurrying into a life of crime in order to get money \u2013 because formula, because algorithm, because he\u2019s going to get In Over His Head. Even the film\u2019s most surreal flourish is deeply templated: the posthumous presence of Justine, who as a ghost (or a vision in Ryan\u2019s head), encourages him to make better decisions; the old \u201cangel on his shoulder\u201d chestnut.Sign up to Saved for LaterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsafter newsletter promotionThese moments, again, to the credit of the actors and Nable\u2019s direction, aren\u2019t very compelling but they don\u2019t feel clumsy, even suiting the film\u2019s downcast atmosphere. And downcast it surely is: there\u2019s lots of stern looks in Transfusion, along with a lot of bad decisions and tough-talking men. The film is supposed to be dramatically engaging rather than pleasurable \u2013 but it\u2019s only occasionally the former.Transfusion is available to stream on Stan now, and is released on 23 January in the UK on digital platforms","313":"With this turbo-charged and heavy handed epic, Damien Chazelle returns to that tinsel town movie world where he made his breakthrough with 2016\u2019s Oscar-winning La La Land. This one is all about the chaos and excess of 1920s silent era Hollywood, a topic it approaches by being stridently chaotic and excessive.It\u2019s a love letter to the movies, inevitably \u2013 though I remember Chazelle\u2019s previous films being love letters to actual human beings. Chazelle is concerned to restore some of the minorities who have been erased in Hollywood\u2019s heterosexual history, but he really fudges the new #MeToo conversation about the Hollywood golden age. All the raunchy sex here is very much consensual. And those outrageous party scenes, with the mandatory overhead shots showing the ecstatically unclothed women crowd-surfing face-up \u2026 they\u2019re so much like Baz Luhrmann he should be getting a royalty cheque.Various stock characters swirl around in the movie madness: Brad Pitt plays Jack Conrad, a handsome much-married leading man of a certain age in the John Gilbert mould, whose career is on the slide, concealing his boozy ennui with a veneer of genial suavity. Li Jun Li is stylish and charismatic in the role of Lady Fay Zhu, a gay club singer perhaps inspired by Anna May Wong. Jovan Adepo is Sidney Palmer, a brilliant African American jazz trumpeter who is finally given some onscreen time in the talkies, at the expense of racist \u201cblackface\u201d humiliation in the wake of Al Jolson\u2019s success with The Jazz Singer.But most importantly there is Margot Robbie playing Nellie LaRoy, an obsessive wannabe It girl in the style of Evelyn Nesbit or Clara Bow. She impresses everyone with her ability to cry on cue, but needs some elocution lessons from Hedda-and-Louella-type gossip hack Elinor St John (Jean Smart), a haughty Brit working a Henry Higgins side-hustle. Relative newcomer Diego Calva plays Manny Torres, the moviestruck Mexican kid who gets a job on Jack\u2019s location shoot, rises up the studio food chain, pretends to be from Spain to avoid anti-Mexican bigotry and is secretly in love with Nellie.There are plenty of great scenes here: particularly an outrageous set-piece in which Nellie fights a rattlesnake in the desert after one of the many orgiastic parties, a contest which leads to a very erotic encounter with Lady Fay Zhu. Most staggeringly, we have Manny wrangling an elephant to be delivered to a colossally decadent party, where there is to be a Roscoe Arbuckle-style crisis. One plutocrat, doing drugs and pervy activity with a young woman in a private room, panics when she loses consciousness and he and his hard-faced minders use the elephant as a diversionary tactic. The question of rape (which fuelled the actual Arbuckle case, of which he was eventually exonerated), does not feature, although the movie slightly swerves the question of whether this fictional woman recovers or not. It has to be said that the traumatised secret suffered by all It girls from real-life Hollywood tended to be not that they had a quaintly imagined gambling habit (as Nellie has) but that they had been sexually abused by their employers.Babylon is a film that\u2019s thinking big, aiming big, acting big \u2013 but feeling small, and finally ordering us to care about the celluloid magic, a secondary emotional response that should be happening without any explicit instruction. Yet it\u2019s always a pleasure to be in the presence of such blackbelt movie stars as Pitt and Robbie and there is something funny in Babylon\u2019s absurd event-movie gigantism.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotion Babylon is released on 23 December in the US, and on 20 January in the UK.","314":"It seemed, for a brief moment, that film-makers had crafted an entirely new way of watching a thriller back in the mid-2010s. After the found footage boom had started to lose audiences and all sense of logic (if you didn\u2019t scream \u201cwhy the hell are you still filming?\u201d at a screen in that era then you really didn\u2019t live), an even cheaper-to-produce subgenre emerged, replacing a shaky cam with one that never even moves at all. Films such as Unfriended, Open Windows and The Den took place entirely on someone\u2019s laptop screen, a cyber-horror update that was supposed to resonate with an audience whose lives also did the same.But it wasn\u2019t until a few years later, in 2018, when Aneesh Chaganty\u2019s nifty debut Searching truly maximised the new medium, focusing less on demons and more on detectives. His film saw a single dad, played by John Cho, desperately search for help online to track down his missing daughter. A mystery was solved in ways that we often solve lesser mysteries ourselves, with internet assistance. It was a deserved hit but five years later, when we\u2019re even further from what ended up being less a big new trend and more a tiny blip, a spin-off\/sequel lands in cinemas, audience interest to be determined.Missing tells a similar story \u2013 a strained parent-daughter relationship, a baffling disappearance, all unfolding on a MacBook \u2013 but, as is often the case with sequels, ups the ante considerably with newer tech, bigger twists and wider world-building. The characters are unrelated to those in the original but there are ties (the lead watches a Netflix series based on what happened) and other Easter eggs for those invested enough to look for them.The dynamic has also flipped this time around with daughter (Euphoria\u2019s Storm Reid) looking for parent (Nia Long, having a welcome moment with this and The Best Man series on Peacock), who heads on vacation with her boyfriend (Industry\u2019s Ken Leung) and doesn\u2019t come back. The shift in perspective means that jokes at the expense of a father\u2019s tech shortcomings are replaced with mostly hyper-competence, a teen flexing her digital muscles as she marches her way into an online rabbit hole, fully armed. Searching\u2019s editors turned Missing\u2019s writer-directors Nick Johnson and Will Merrick are keenly aware that five years is more like 50 in tech so there\u2019s less reliance on Skype and more appearances of TikTok.Like the first, it\u2019s propulsive and involving and, at times, genuinely innovative but in upgrading our lead to someone who is that much more skilled behind a keyboard, the film relies on scenes of extreme intelligence often directly followed by scenes of staggering stupidity in order to keep certain developments under wraps. Reid is a compelling and commanding protagonist and the makers understandably want us to see more of her but that often means that she just happens to keep leaving on her webcam or her FaceTime just so we, the audience, can see her react. Moments of far-fetched, sigh-at-the-screen incredulity are also met by an overdose of sentimentality, something that felt less gloopy in the original, which was more elegant in its estranged parent-daughter drama. Brevity is always a welcome quality for a B-movie such as this and at almost two hours, the flaws of Missing are given too much space to distract.But sighs at incongruously dumb behaviour and groans at the family soap are eventually drowned out by audible gasps at some of the wild twists, the kind that might not make much sense on reflection but do deliver cattle-prod shocks along the way. Missing might not make a strong enough case for the subgenre at large to return (talk of Unfriended 3 has been mercifully muted) but it\u2019s entertaining enough to show that this particular series does have more battery life.Missing is out 20 January in US cinemas, 26 January in Australia, and on 21 April in UK cinemas.","315":"Anna Kendrick gives a vehement, self-aware lead performance in this Gaslight-style suspense drama about a young woman trapped in a coercive, abusive relationship from screenwriter Alanna Francis and debut feature director Mary Nighy. There are some edge-of-the-seat moments and interestingly subtle tonal inflexions, though the story spends time on a contrived subplot about a missing girl, time that might have been better devoted to developing the central thriller storyline.Alice (Kendrick) is in a toxic relationship with Simon (Charlie Carrick), an arrogant, controlling man with an uncertain career as an artist, in constant need of reassurance and always tracking Alice\u2019s movements. When Alice is allowed out for a rare evening at a bar with her two best friends Tess (Kaniehtiio Horn) and Sophie (Wunmi Mosaku), we can see how glassy-eyed Alice\u2019s smile is, how tensely distracted, how she flinches at each ping from her phone. She is no longer the vivacious friend Tess and Sophie once knew and loved; she appears to have issues with food and her hair is thin.Francis\u2019s script allows us to notice that her friend Tess is also an artist (but less successful than obnoxious, strutting Simon), and we can see the queasy irony in Alice having possibly met Simon in Tess\u2019s circle, and how he is coldly taking her away from them. Tensely aware that Simon won\u2019t like it, Alice accepts an invitation to go away on a vacation with Tess and Sophie but tells him it\u2019s a work trip she can\u2019t get out of. How long will Simon be fooled by that?Kendrick is capable of creating an arrhythmic heartbeat of tension and fear in her screen presence: this is someone who is gradually being deprived of emotional oxygen. But sometimes the tendons in the script go slack \u2013 and there is also something here which doesn\u2019t quite allow the relationship between Alice and her friends, and relationship of Tess and Sophie with each other, to become fully three-dimensional. Well, it\u2019s a very strong performance from Kendrick, who disturbingly conveys the tiny and not so tiny symptoms of emotional abuse. Alice, Darling is released on 20 January in cinemas in the US and UK with an Australian release date to be confirmed.

She comes with a price tag that would buy you a midsized family car, a full gamut of judgmental tweenager eye rolls and a taste for casual slaughter. And right now, she\u2019s a lifeline for her creator, robotics engineer Gemma (Allison Williams). Following the deaths of her sister and brother-in-law, Gemma finds herself caring for her traumatised eight-year-old niece, Cady (Violet McGraw). It\u2019s a job that Gemma is only too happy to outsource to Frankenstein\u2019s 4ft devil Barbie, a decision that comes back to bite her (and to attack her with a hammer).The latest addition to the killer doll genre, M3gan is an enjoyable horror-lite romp: knowing, amusing, but not particularly scary. But while the psychotically perky robot might not have the chaotic energy of Chucky from the Child\u2019s Play franchise or the porcelain malevolence of Annabelle, she does bring a pleasing TikTok-friendly pizazz to her killing rampages. I suspect we\u2019ll be seeing a lot more of the murder toy of the moment.","317":"Film-maker Mark Jenkin originally intended to brand his superbly haunting follow-up to Bait (2019) as \u201ca lost Cornish folk horror\u201d film. He was persuaded to drop most of those descriptions: Enys Men isn\u2019t lost (although it does feel like a recently unearthed magical relic from another era); it isn\u2019t really horror (despite that ultra-creepy trailer); and the word \u201cfolk\u201d is oddly misleading. That left \u201ca Cornish film\u201d \u2013 a simple phrase that perfectly encapsulates the myriad mysteries soaked into the dreamy, tactile landscape of this handmade gem. I could tell you that Enys Men (which means Stone Island) is Shirley Jackson\u2019s The Haunting of Hill House as reimagined by the ghost of Nic Roeg; that it\u2019s the cult 70s TV frightener The Stone Tape reconfigured through the inspirational prism of playwright and environmental activist Nick Darke; or that it owes more to the Japanese chiller Onibaba than to the \u201cunholy trinity\u201d of British folk-horror (Witchfinder General, The Blood on Satan\u2019s Claw and The Wicker Man). But the more I think about it, the more \u201ca Cornish film\u201d says it all.It\u2019s easier to describe Enys Men in terms of colour (red and yellow are primal elements) than plot, since its distinct brand of clockwork-cranked, luxuriously saturated cinematic poetry is supremely resistant to precis. Suffice to say that it plays out on an island off the Cornish coast in the days before May Day, 1973. Mary Woodvine is quietly mesmerising as the unnamed volunteer stationed alone on the island, although as she says: \u201cI\u2019m not on my own.\u201d Her life is ritual: walking the rugged cliffs, taking temperature readings around an outcrop of rare flowers; listening to a stone drop down a mineshaft; writing the day\u2019s findings (\u201cno change\u201d) in her botanical diary. Back at the cottage, she fires up the growling generator (fuel supplies are low), makes the tea (also running out), and takes to bed with a copy of A Blueprint for Survival, an environmentalist text whose cover is emblazoned with the promise that after reading it \u201cnothing quite seems the same any more\u201d. The same could be said of this film.The volunteer\u2019s primary connection with the mainland is via radio, a mysterious medium (whether VHF transmitter or Dansette transistor) that conjures voices like spirits in a seance: fragmented conversations with a distant presence (\u201care you there?\u201d); a distress signal (\u201cMayday! Mayday!\u201d) from a wreck foretold; the heart-piercing voice of Brenda Wootton singing The Bristol Christ (from a poem by Cornish bard Charles Causley).Meanwhile, the island seems to breathe the history of Cornwall \u2013 from the miners still haunting the darkened shafts below, to the Bal Maidens stomping the ground above, and the children who sing outside the volunteer\u2019s cottage. Presiding over this time-slipping strangeness is a giant standing stone with a profound living-rock connection to the volunteer. No wonder the lichen that appears on those rare flowers also colonises her body, linking us back to an earlier trauma, played out in tantalising form by the enigmatic Flo Crowe.In his current BFI season The Cinematic DNA of Enys Men, Jenkin juxtaposes the Cornish-set Children\u2019s Film Foundation production Haunters of the Deep with the Australian eco-chiller Long Weekend (\u201ctheir crime was against nature!\u201d) and Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Larraz\u2019s atmospheric British psychodrama Symptoms. But it\u2019s Lawrence Gordon Clark\u2019s Stigma, made in 1977 as part of the BBC\u2019s A Ghost Story for Christmas series, that offers the most intriguing touchstone, sharing with Enys Men an atmosphere of uncanny weirdness, closely aligned with the writings of MR James, or John Wyndham.Some will be left confused \u2013 even frustrated \u2013 by a narrative that slips dextrously between dreams and reality (Lost Highway is also in that BFI season). Indeed, in one scene the volunteer burns her hand on a stove to bring herself back to the \u201cnow\u201d, to the \u201creal\u201d. Such endeavours are self-defeating; better simply to let Enys Men drown you in its intensely sensory spell; to feel it rather than watch it.What Enys Men \u201cmeans\u201d will differ for each viewer. For me, it is (like Bait) a richly authentic portrait of Cornwall, far removed from any tourist-friendly vision \u2013 a land defined by rugged industry (those miners are still down below), locked in an elemental struggle with the sea (a force that can both give and take life) and driven by a palpable sense of the past underpinning the future. I\u2019ve seen the film three times so far, and I can\u2019t wait to dive into it and be swept away again. Bravo!","318":"The genius of Todd Field\u2019s superb T\u00e1r comes from the way the film-making echoes the treacherously seductive and mercurial nature of its central character. Lydia T\u00e1r (an electrifying Cate Blanchett) is a dazzling talent: a world-class conductor and composer with a towering ego to match her formidable professional reputation. She describes herself, in a rare, entirely insincere moment of self-deprecation, as \u201ca U-haul lesbian\u201d, but in fact she is one half of a Berlin Philharmonic power couple: her partner is the lead violinist, Sharon Goodnow (Nina Hoss).T\u00e1r is magnificent. At the same time she\u2019s a monster, a capricious narcissist who charms a series of young women, all rising stars in classical music, who subsequently find their careers stymied when they fly too close to the blistering heat of her self-regard.Field (Oscar nominated for his two previous films, Little Children and In the Bedroom) brings a slippery complexity to proceedings. Is T\u00e1r the slow-motion car crash of a cancellation? The crash and burn of hubristic ambition? A supernatural thriller? A Shakespearean tragedy about a powerful individual driven to the brink of madness by the niggling attrition of guilt? There\u2019s also a mean-spirited crackle of humour here and there.It\u2019s a phenomenal picture, supported by top-tier crew, from Bina Daigeler\u2019s costumes (T\u00e1r\u2019s tailored suits are a kind of intellectual armour) to Florian Hoffmeister\u2019s lithe camerawork, which captures symphonies of discomfort in the musicians, starting in the string section with a stricken, shamed Sharon, and answered by a flutter of uncertainty that spreads through the orchestra like a scurrilous rumour.","319":"One of the many reasons schlock horror M3gan become such a surprise critical darling last week was down to Universal\u2019s crafty release strategy, sashaying into the otherwise dead zone of January, easily leaping over an extremely low bar. This week reminds us of what the month usually offers US cinema-goers \u2013 an unwanted comedy remake, a horror film for Christians and a Gerard Butler action thriller \u2013 junk that\u2019s easy for the studios to dump and even easier for audiences to forget.Already the subject of social media jabs because of its ridiculous title, the Butler of it all, a film about a plane called Plane, is a January movie through and through, filling empty screens just because they need filling, doing the least but at an aggressively loud volume. There have certainly been worse B-movies released in this most cursed of months (last year\u2019s kidnapped mermaid saga The King\u2019s Daughter and 2020\u2019s staggeringly, almost satirically, incompetent Blake Lively thriller The Rhythm Section spring to mind) but there have also recently been far better (slay M3gan slay etc) and as such, Plane doesn\u2019t exactly rise above that low bar but sort of meets it head-on.For a film called Plane, there\u2019s really not as much plane as one would hope here, disappointing given how ideal that setting can be for a B-thriller that might be in need of a lift, exemplified by Rachel MacAdams in Red Eye, Jodie Foster in Flight Plan, Liam Neeson in Non-Stop and, hopefully, Taron Egerton in the upcoming Carry On. Everything you need to know about Plane can more easily be summed up by Butler\u2019s absurd character name \u2013 Brodie Torrance, something one would expect to find in a half-price airport potboiler. He\u2019s a salt-of-the-earth Scottish pilot, whose character can best be described as pilot, tasked with flying a tiny number of passengers on a new year\u2019s flight from Singapore to Tokyo (anyone who has been on a plane in the last two years will find the large number of empty seats to be the most far-fetched thing about the film).But there\u2019s a lightning storm which forces Butler to make an emergency landing on a remote island in the Philippines. While he manages it with the grace of an unshaven Sully, he\u2019s then tasked with keeping his passengers safe from a killer (Mike Colter) who was being transported onboard which would be bad enough until he finds out that the island is run by a violent group of rebels who have a history of kidnapping \u2013 and killing \u2013 foreigners.A more accurate title would then be Island, but Plane is perhaps best at least for instructing audience on the best location to watch the film, half-awake, tipsy on wine served from a litre bottle. It\u2019s usually the kind of dross that would arrive straight to one\u2019s rental service of choice (like Butler\u2019s last film, Last Seen Alive) and it\u2019s only when one digs a little deeper, that we see the budget is a pretty considerable $50m, impressive enough whenever the release in this climate but at this time of year, that makes it the equivalent of a Marvel movie (in comparison, M3gan cost just $12m). It therefore needed to launch in your local multiplex to turn a profit although, it\u2019s often a head-scratcher trying to figure out just where that money went. The cast, outside of Butler, Colter and a few scenes of a sleep-walking Tony Goldwyn, are mostly bit-players, the action scenes are mainly just lots of shooting and the plane scenes are often strangely shaky, as if someone is dangling a model plane on a piece of string.It\u2019s just about diverting enough for the most part but there\u2019s something a little off about its pacing, French director Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Richet (who peaked a while back with his propulsive Mesrine movies) struggling to corral his moving parts, suspense never really arriving as it should. Instead, we get bullets, a boring amount of them in fact, with a finale based around who can shoot the most before that plane comes back into play. There are small mercies throughout: Butler is thankfully not attempting an American or, shudder, Irish accent (even if to prove he\u2019s Scottish he says haggis in the first 15 minutes), his character is also not a readymade action hero (there\u2019s one easy-to-empathise with moment when he takes a good 30 seconds to regain his breath after a fight) and Colter has real movie star presence on show here in bursts (even if it still feels waiting to be utilised properly).It\u2019s hard to hope for that much more in January and the silliness of Plane will probably do the job for those burned out by the stone-faced seriousness of awards season fodder but for a film all about unpretentious fun, I wish there had been a bit more of it.Plane is out now in US cinemas and in the UK on 27 January","320":"Antonio Banderas is a class act but there\u2019s only so much class he can reasonably be expected to supply. Taking what was presumably an attractive paycheque, Banderas stars in a movie whose essential personality could only be appreciated if Blockbuster Video were to be brought back to life, just for one week, so this could be placed in the straight-to-video bin next to every till.Veteran screenwriter W Peter Ilff (who co-wrote Point Break) has dug this one out of his desk drawer and Australian adman-turned-film-maker Richard Hughes directs. Banderas plays \u2019Cuda (short for Barracuda), a careworn Miami debt collector and ex-con, working for Estelle (Kate Bosworth), scary club owner and mob boss. He is estranged from the teen daughter who despises him and, out of fatherly sadness and a denied protective instinct, he tries to befriend and protect vulnerable runaway Billie (Zolee Griggs), who is promptly kidnapped and trafficked into a horrendous cybersex dungeon. The only way \u2019Cuda can save her is with his other mentoring project: a young guy called Stray (Mojean Aria) who earns money bareknuckle fighting and helping \u2019Cuda collect debts. Together they uncover an awful secret connecting them to this grisly exploitative crime.This movie hangs together plausibly enough although there are plotholes, and perhaps it would have had more punch if it was \u2019Cuda\u2019s actual daughter, as opposed to daughter-substitute, who had been taken. But The Enforcer does have a great example of that time-honoured gun denouement in which our hero, disarmed and resigned to being shot by the bad guy, flinches at the sound of the shot, realises he isn\u2019t dead and then sees a third person who has shot the aggressor: this film has a nicely outrageous spin on that. Otherwise, it\u2019s a film that should really exist on a VHS cassette. The Enforcer is released on 6 January in cinemas.","321":"A sick feeling of dread propels Chinonye Chukwu\u2019s powerful movie: dread at the racist violence about to happen, dread at the racist violence that is then threatened against those standing up against it. This film is about Emmett Till, the black 14-year-old tortured and lynched in 1955 Mississippi for supposedly whistling at a white woman, whose testimony at the subsequent murder trial was disputed. (The closing credits icily remind us that this woman is still alive.) It is also about the boy\u2019s mother Mamie Till, and her courageous campaign for justice, which began with a laceratingly painful decision to have an open casket at her son\u2019s funeral to show everyone the shocking truth.Danielle Deadwyler plays Mamie Till, a calm, determined professional woman and single parent; Whoopi Goldberg has a cameo as her mother, Alma. Jalyn Hall plays Emmett as a smart, extrovert kid with an irrepressible puppyish enthusiasm: cheeky, but no more cheeky than many other teenagers, and mostly just naive. He is sent from his home town of Chicago to stay with family in Mississippi for the summer, with a stern warning from his mother to be careful around white people.Some of the film\u2019s purest nausea resides in the trial itself, with the swaggeringly open racism of the court officials and police. Quite clearly, the fact that any trial was possible at all was down to Mamie Till and the NAACP who took up her cause; it was virtually a private prosecution, the terrible burden for this being placed entirely on Mamie Till herself. Chukwu contrives a stunning coup for the scene in which she arrives at the courthouse, surrounded by NAACP officials and is about to make a quiet, dignified statement to reporters, whose attitude is not obviously different from the jeering crowd behind them; what happens next is best not revealed here, but it is a heartstopping lurch of ironised fear, a bathos of horror.Till is a fierce portrait of courage and a sombre study of the human cost involved in resisting this kind of barbarity. Till is released on 6 January in cinemas.","322":"Putting her privileged access to good use, Mary McCartney has directed this enjoyable documentary about Abbey Road Studios in London \u2013 famously the site of the Beatles\u2019 classic recordings (her dad is Paul of course), but much more besides. McCartney\u2019s film takes us through the history of the building itself (in the St John\u2019s Wood neighbourhood of London, perhaps only Lord\u2019s cricket ground is more of an English icon).It was designed to house a symphony orchestra, and its first occupant in 1931 was Edward Elgar conducting the LSO. It looks very different from the way we think of recording studios,small spaces divided from the mixing suite by a pane of glass. In fact two of the studios are huge, where mighty producer George Martin presided over everything from suites accessed by flights of stairs, like going up to the manager\u2019s office from the echoing factory shop floor.Paul McCartney is interviewed, as well as Elton John and Jimmy Page, who talk about their days as session musicians there. The Beatles did their best work at Abbey Road, as did Pink Floyd, Oasis and so many more. But there was also Jacqueline du Pr\u00e9 recording the Elgar cello concerto; McCartney\u2019s film has great footage of her vivid, beaming face as she rehearses with Daniel Barenboim.The 1960s gave Abbey Road its golden age of pop and then, just as times were economically hard in the 70s, Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and John Williams gave it a new lease of life by making it their home for recording the rousing orchestral scores for their hit movies. Williams gives a fine account of how Abbey Road \u2013 though a shoebox compared to Hollywood soundstages \u2013 is large enough to give the music its reverberant \u201cbloom\u201d but small enough to preserve detail and articulation. And he and his colleagues were amused at how drinking alcohol in the canteen didn\u2019t seem to hinder the workrate. I have only one quarrel with the film: I would have liked to see something about Abbey Road\u2019s part in the history of comedy, with Martin producing Peter Sellers\u2019 comedy LP work there. But it\u2019s a diverting private tour. If These Walls Could Sing is released on 6 January on Disney+.","323":"Capitalism never looked more brutal than in this new Catalan-language movie with nonprofessionals from Carla Sim\u00f3n; it is about an extended family of peach farmers in the town of Alcarr\u00e0s, people whose unhappiness and dysfunction are created by market forces. It was the winner of the Golden Bear at the Berlin film festival and is this year\u2019s Spanish entry for the best international film Academy Award.Sim\u00f3n\u2019s debut was the wonderfully tender childhood study Summer 1993 and Alcarr\u00e0s is her very accomplished follow-up. I felt it didn\u2019t quite have the same immediately accessible richness and sweetness, but this is a really shrewd, empathic and subtle movie which engulfs you in its dust and sweat and heat.Quimet, played by Jordi Pujol Dolcet, is a middleaged farmer who lives with his clan in a rambling rented house with its own swimming pool, surrounded by peach trees, whose delicious fruit he is getting ready to harvest: backbreakingly hard work which he does by hand with family members, together with some African immigrant labour. His wife Dolors (Anna Ot\u00edn) helps, as does his son Roger (Albert Bosch) \u2013 though Dolors has onerous housework and childcare, as well as having to massage Quimet\u2019s aching back, with little thanks from her grumpy and depressed husband. Their teen daughter Mariona (X\u00e9nia Roset) is busy rehearsing a dance number for the town\u2019s summer talent show, and their youngest, Iris (Ainet Jounou), likes playing in an abandoned car in the farmland with her cousins Pau (Isaac Rovira) and Pere (Joel Rovira).To Iris\u2019s awestruck astonishment, strange grownups arrive one day and take away her beloved car: this is an awful omen of the problems to come. The supermarkets are offering Quimet insultingly low prices for his produce, and like other farmers he is getting ready for a mass protest. But his landlord, Pinyol (Jacob Diarte) has in any case curtly informed him that all the peach trees are to be ripped out and replaced with solar panels, and if he wants, he can retrain as a solar panel engineer, which is far more lucrative. Quimet\u2019s elderly father Rogelio (Josep Abad) failed to get their land-tenancy in writing: it was merely a gentleman\u2019s agreement with Pinyol\u2019s late father which the son has ignored.This agony tears their family apart: Quimet is enraged that his way of life has been cancelled, but his sister and brother-in-law want to take the solar panel deal and his son Roger is in any case hurt at his father\u2019s contemptuous indifference to all his new ideas on irrigation. And so Quimet, exploited by the landlord class, is also cruel to his own staff, the labourers that he must mostly lay off.Movies about rural ways of life are often supposed to be all about the sacred, seasonal rhythm of reaping and sowing. But here there is no rhythm. There is just one continuous throb of anxiety: whether the crop will fail, whether it will be eaten by rabbits, whether it will be underpriced by the supermarket buyers. And now the whole system has been thrown out. There is a new harvest to be gathered: solar power.Sim\u00f3n\u2019s film asks us: is Quimet right to be outraged or not? Is there something sacred about the planting, growing and selling of peaches? Aren\u2019t solar panels, with their superiority to fossil fuels, just as important? Might Quimet be, in some inexpressibly painful sense, simply loyal to unhappiness, loyal to a business that has not brought him satisfaction? There is something agonising, almost self-harming in Quimet\u2019s protest stunt: he dumps a mountain of his precious peaches outside the supermarket offices: a vast, squelchy pile symbolising his wretchedness and rage. It is a deeply intelligent, humane drama. Alcarr\u00e0s is released on 6 January in cinemas, and on 24 February on Mubi.","324":"This list is compiled by the Guardian film team, with all films released in the UK during 2022 in contention.

Each in its own way was hamstrung by legal issues and family pressure, although Broomfield\u2019s was perhaps the more judicious and insightful. Now here is a music biopic on very traditional lines from screenwriter Anthony McCarten and director Kasi Lemmons: a smoothly watchable and well performed piece of work. It is almost a 144-minute narrative montage, and very avoidant on key issues \u2013 seemingly deferring to everyone who is still alive and suing.British actor Naomi Ackie is very strong in the role of Houston (though with Whitney\u2019s original singing voice dubbed). Houston was, of course, the glorious pop star who achieved mainstream white-crossover success but was crushed by sellout accusations, overwork, drug addiction, family strife and her volatile relationship with her notorious husband, Bobby Brown, and was tragically denied feelings for her best friend and assistant Robyn Crawford. She was found dead in the bathtub of her LA hotel room in 2012 at just 48 with evidence of cocaine use. Tamara Tunie and Clarke Peters give powerhouse performances as Whitney\u2019s gospel-singer mom Cissy and overbearing dad John; Nafessa Williams is very plausible as Whitney\u2019s loyal but finally heartbreakingly slighted lost love Crawford, and Stanley Tucci scene-stealingly plays avuncular record boss Clive Davis.The movie skates over the still fraught subject of who was supplying Houston with drugs and who therefore effectively enabled her sad death, and it simply does not mention that Houston\u2019s grownup daughter herself died just three years later in a grimly similar way. Documentaries have tiptoed around the allegations that family members had to source drugs on tour; this film conveniently invents a shifty-looking white guy who asks Houston for her autograph and then cash and drugs are surreptitiously exchanged under cover of Houston getting pen and paper from her bag. Nor does this film mention the theory from Macdonald\u2019s documentary that Houston was sexually abused as a child by a cousin.It does however deliver the big scenes and big moments, especially her amazing performance of the national anthem at the 1991 Super Bowl. But a boilerplate music biopic like this usually runs in four stages: tough beginnings, success, crisis and redemptive comeback. Whitney\u2019s life can\u2019t give us the last of these and this film averts its gaze from the grim final reality of that hotel room in 2012, preferring to circle back in flashback to the triumph of Whitney\u2019s performance at the 1994 American Music Awards, in which she sang her famous medley of I Loves You Porgy, And I Am Telling You I\u2019m Not Going and I Have Nothing.The ultimate questions are not really answered: was Whitney a gay woman whose problems stemmed from being imprisoned in the closet? Was she a gospel\/R&B genius whose agonies arose from being a pop princess for white audiences? Or was it simply that she had to use drugs to relieve the stress of a touring schedule she was forced into by her big-spending family retinue? It could be any of these, and the film touches gingerly on each possibility. But it\u2019s a muscular, heartfelt performance from Ackie.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotion I Wanna Dance With Somebody is released on 23 December in the US and 26 December in the UK and Australia.","326":"Ambition, sin and horror are the keynotes of Thorold Dickinson\u2019s brilliant 1949 melodrama based on the story by Pushkin. The density of visual detail and incident on screen is superb and the swirling, delirious onrush of storytelling is addictive. This is surely one of the great gambling movies, and one that makes the theological connection explicit: Pascal recommended that you have nothing to lose by betting on God\u2019s existence, but the worldly sinner gambles that the last judgement does not exist and that pleasure and gratification in this life are everything. Dickinson\u2019s control of the screen is a joy, something to be compared to Max Oph\u00fcls: I wonder how he might have directed The Earrings of Madame De\u2026 or how he might have adapted Dostoevsky\u2019s The Gambler or Tolstoy\u2019s How Much Land Does a Man Need?Anton Walbrook gives a glorious, gamey performance as Suvorin, a Russian military officer in St Petersburg. A humble captain intensely aware of his lack of money, Suvorin is obsessed, like much of fashionable Russia of the time, with France\u2019s low-born leader Bonaparte, who rose to the top with pure audacity and courage. Walbrook appears without the raffish moustache that he had for his famous performances in Powell\/Pressburger movies such as The Red Shoes and The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp, and his face is somehow naked without it, exposed and desperate. But his Austrian accent makes a certain sort of sense: in Pushkin\u2019s original story, his character was an ethnic German.Suvorin regularly attends a dissolute military club at the invitation of his friend, the kindly, well-born brother officer Prince Andrei (Ronald Howard), who sympathises with Suvorin as a lonely, sensitive, prickly soul. What fills Suvorin with greedy, envious fascination are the fortunes won and lost there every night at cards: an addictively simple game called faro, in which everyone is superstitiously obsessed with the bad luck involved in playing the queen of spades.Suvorin becomes electrified by the rumour (though a flashback implies it is considerably more than a rumour) that ancient, haughty Countess Ranevskaya, thrillingly played by Edith Evans, once sold her soul to the devil to learn the secret of winning at faro; this was to recover her husband\u2019s money, which she had lost to a secret lover. Interestingly, the nobleman who is supposed to have brokered the encounter with the Prince of Darkness is a real-life figure: the Count of St Germain, a philosopher and adventurer who appeared as if he might be French, with the same dark glamour of Napoleon, although in fact it appears he was from central Europe.Cunning Suvorin plans to gain access to Countess Ranevskaya\u2019s house by seducing the old lady\u2019s gentle, impressionable companion, Lizaveta Ivanova (a sympathetic performance from Yvonne Mitchell), and they have a murmuringly passionate encounter in the opera foyer. She is also being courted by Andrei, whose decent and diffident good nature is no match for Suvorin\u2019s brash desperation and fanaticism, which poor innocent Lizaveta mistakes for ardent passion. This is in fact the one way in which the lowborn Suvorin has the advantage over the aristocrat \u2013 and the film allows us to see his self-destructive madness in not appreciating an opportunity for happiness.When the crazed Suvorin finally comes face to face with the cantankerous old lady, it is a scene of pure fear: as Nietzsche might have said, Suvorin is staring into the abyss and the abyss stares back.

Like Sofia Coppola\u2019s Marie Antoinette and Pablo Larra\u00edn\u2019s Princess Diana, the kaiserin lives in a luxurious delirium of loneliness: notionally cherished, actually patronised.The movie even shows the empress riding at the Northamptonshire estates of Diana\u2019s ancestor, the fifth Earl Spencer \u2013 and enjoying there a capricious romantic flirtation with her riding instructor. It\u2019s broadly historically accurate, though this doesn\u2019t apply to the use of Help Me Make It Through the Night on the soundtrack or indeed Elisabeth\u2019s encounter with later inventions such as cinema and heroin. But Kreutzer sees her political melancholy as part of the tension that led to the first world war.Elisabeth is brilliantly played by Vicky Krieps as mysterious and sensual, imperious and severe: a woman of passions and discontents who faces icy distaste from the court and the family of her unfaithful husband Franz Joseph (Florian Teichtmeister) \u2013 this is because of her sympathies for the Hungarian part of the Habsburg empire and her intimacy with the worldly Hungarian Count Andr\u00e1ssy (Tam\u00e1s Lengyel). Snickering Viennese attendants and officials impugn her Austrian loyalties as they body-shame Elisabeth \u2013 every day she faces the literal and figurative struggle to fit into her corsage and get down to a terrifying 18 inches around the waist.Elisabeth wears violet gowns, violet parasols, smokes violet cigarettes and distributes violet-scented chocolates to the unfortunates in hospitals and asylums. She only really smiles at the sight of her dogs and is utterly devastated when the horse that threw her has to be shot. When travelling incognito in Vienna (to spy on her husband\u2019s mistress) she wears a dark veil \u2013 and requires an attendant to pose as her in this veil for a formal event while she is indoors shooting up. Later, she suffers the indignity of being congratulated on her atypical poise on this occasion.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotionElisabeth\u2019s whole life is veiled, and Kreutzer sees her style of dress and existence almost as a variation of court mourning. The movie has her living in a series of huge, chilly salons and gloomy dining rooms from which she takes refuge in bathrooms, subjecting herself to various self-harming weight-loss regimes. She is a lonely figure, galloping unattended across various European estates. She remembers the alcoholism of her Bavarian father, who would put away seven tankards of beer of an evening and she confesses that she thought all grownups slurred their speech after dark.In many ways this is a study in anger, and it is an austere and angular picture. Krieps gives an exhilaratingly fierce, uningratiating performance. Kreutzer\u2019s last film, The Ground Beneath My Feet, from 2019, had just the same shrewd sense of how women are isolated and restricted by whatever status they have been able to cultivate. For Elisabeth, the personal is political. Corsage screened at the Cannes film festival and is released in UK cinema on 26 December.","328":"Here is an invigorating portrait of one of Europe\u2019s most distinguished scientists, caught at the very point of morphing into a public intellectual and vehement campaigner. In 2017, Swiss biophysicist Jacques Dubochet won the Nobel prize in chemistry \u2013 jointly with Richard Henderson of the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge and Joachim Frank of Columbia in New York \u2013 for his work on cryo-electron microscopy, freezing biomolecules in mid-movement and so rendering them visible for the first time; this was a great leap forward for pharmacy and medicine.The snowy-haired Dubochet, who did his important work at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg before returning to Lausanne, is shown to be at first bemused and a little flustered by the hordes of excitable photographers who descend on his tranquil campus, clamouring for interviews and demanding a soundbite explanation of his work for the TV news. But Dubochet is no innocent: he was a committed anti-nuclear campaigner in Germany in the \u201cAtomkraft? Nein Danke\u201d era of the 80s, and the film shows it dawning on Dubochet that he can use his new platform to campaign on the new issue that he\u2019s passionate about \u2013 the climate crisis.Dubochet thus becomes a participant in climate-strike demos, beaming at young people\u2019s idealism, appearing alongside Greta Thunberg, and becoming enraged at his fellow Swiss for their complacent insularity and at journalists for their supposed neutrality, and failure to report the crisis. He also \u2013 just maybe \u2013 becomes a little bit intoxicated by his own celebrity, a possibility hinted at during a discussion over the family dinner table. This is a thoroughly worthwhile documentary, although there is one subject I\u2019d like to hear Dubochet address: as an anti-nuke veteran, does he have any time for environmentalists who believe that nuclear power might not be as evil as all that? Citizen Nobel is released on 16 December on True Story.","329":"Intimate and insightful on the highs and lows of life in the music industry, this portrait of the Australian singer-songwriter Courtney Barnett feels particularly timely. Using footage captured on and off stage, and a bruisingly candid audio diary recorded at the request of director Danny Cohen, the film works both as a document for existing fans and a valuable contribution to an ongoing conversation about the mental health impacts of life on the road.Barnett works through creative crises, wrangles doubts and anguish, and the wrung-out exhaustion of giving everything to an audience of hungry strangers night after night. While the film is not particularly groundbreaking in its approach to the music documentary, it\u2019s unusually candid and open in what it reveals about the cost of the creative process.","330":"A marathon documentary about a veteran schoolteacher and his multicultural class of 12- to 14-year-olds in Stadtallendorf, central Germany, this extraordinary film, which won last year\u2019s Silver Bear jury prize at the Berlin film festival, follows the tradition of observational humanism popularised by such film-makers as Frederick Wiseman and Michael Apted. It\u2019s an investment in time, certainly, but this profound and hopeful picture justifies every second of its three hours and 38 minute running time.Dieter Bachmann\u2019s teaching methods are unconventional \u2013 he leans on storytelling and music in a classroom that has a full drum kit and is lined with guitars. But as an early scene in Maria Speth\u2019s sensitive portrait shows, his approach is uniquely attuned to the needs of his students, many of whom are recent migrants who are not yet fluent in German. Herr Bachmann spins a surreal story of sentient furniture and musical instruments, and gradually the deflated kids perk up and engage. Ultimately, however, this is not just a celebration of one man, but of all teachers who go above and beyond for the children in their care. This article was amended on 12 December 2022. The Silver Bear prize is awarded at the Berlin international film festival (Berlinale), not Cannes as an earlier version said owing to an editing error.","331":"A lovely, low-key showcase for the talents of character actors Dale Dickey and Wes Studi, A Love Song is a wistful little gem of a film. Dickey plays Faye, a widow camped out by the side of a Colorado lake, eking out a stripped-back existence of birdwatching, boiling up coffee and catching crawfish. The vast potential of the wild and limitless landscape is mirrored in miniature in Faye\u2019s life. She\u2019s at a turning point. On a whim she sent a letter to her first love, Lito (Studi). And although she\u2019s no longer sure she will recognise him, she waits for him.There\u2019s a sparseness and stillness to Max Walker-Silverman\u2019s storytelling that is filled by Dickey\u2019s terrific, lived-in performance and the brief spark of connection between two lonely people.","332":"You fear the worst when you discover that this is an anime about a high-school tutor forced to choose which of his five quintuplet students to marry; will it be something flagrantly oblivious to recent #MeToo advances? But Masato Jinbo\u2019s film is actually a fairly charming, if stridently sentimental and moralistic romantic fantasy that, with its clever structure, even manages to pick at the mysteries of identity.The story is the culmination of the Quintessential Quintuplets TV series, an adaptation of the 2017-2020 manga of the same title. One mitigating factor is that Uesugi (voiced by Yoshitsugu Matsuoka) is approximately the same age as the five sapphire-eyed quins he is chaperoning as the end of the school year approaches. Everyone is looking ahead to their plans for the future, but there is the annual school festival to get out of the way first. The five siblings are equally moony over their tutor, and gathering them together, he admits he has feelings for them, too. But he promises to choose one by the time the three-day festivities are done.Given how Jinbo flits between time frames, and in and out of character\u2019s thoughts, following the identical quins isn\u2019t easy at first. But the film quickly becomes an elegantly hormonal Rashomon, tracking each one in turn over the three-day period, carefully individuating each to the point it begins to graze the old nature\/nurture chestnut: how flighty Ichika (Kana Hanazawa), already a famous teen actor, can be so different from the stern but protective Nino (Ayana Taketatsu); ditto overcompensating people-pleaser Yotsuba (Ayane Sakura).Weaving in a thread about the girls\u2019 biological and adoptive dads, the business of settling this love hexagon is conducted with the same vehement seriousness as the Shogun picking clans in a medieval samurai drama \u2013 only with copious blushing and Uesugi gasping like he\u2019s been run through every time he kisses someone. It largely avoids ickiness, apart from the bosomy waterpark intro; in fact, its insistence on the essential fallibility of the teacher, that they are there to learn from their students as much as vice versa, shows sensitivity. Like Uesugi\u2019s ability to distinguish between the girls, The Quintessential Quintuplets looks beyond the surface. The Quintessential Quintuplets Movie is released in cinemas on 7 December.","333":"Produced by Ai Weiwei, this is a rousing portrait of Liu Ximei, an astonishingly resilient Aids activist; it also sheds light on a controversial government campaign that accelerated the epidemic in 1990s China. During the first half of the decade, poor farmers were encouraged to donate their blood in exchange for money. Due to a lack of health and safety standards, a staggering number of donors as well as those who received transfusions contracted HIV. In Ximei\u2019s province of Henan, more than 300,000 villagers live with the debilitating effects of the condition, all while facing societal discrimination and neglect.In following Ximei\u2019s day-to-day routines, the film captures the gruelling reality of simply making your voice heard in an environment that is determined to strip HIV-positive people of their humanity. The lively thread that binds this stigmatised community together, Ximei makes endless trips to the central hospital where she demands better medical treatment on behalf of other HIV-positive people, many of whom are elderly and illiterate. In contrast to the indifference of government officials, the warm atmosphere of Ximei\u2019s home, a haven for those living with HIV, attests to the importance of community and grassroots organisation. Ximei herself was abandoned by her birth parents; later, when she was diagnosed with HIV at the age of 10 after a blood transfusion, it was her foster family that nurtured her sense of compassion.Shot over seven years by director Andy Cohen under surveillance and interference from Chinese officials, this film, like Ximei\u2019s tireless work, feels like a miracle. In juxtaposing her activism and the hardships of her condition with intimate moments such as her wedding, the documentary beautifully shows how the lives of Ximei and many others are not defined by their HIV status. Ximei is released on 1 December in cinemas.","334":"Here is a beautifully gentle and melancholy coming-of-age YA adventure from the Japanese animator Atsuko Ishizuka. The story will be instantly familiar: a tale of boyhood friendship coming to an end \u2013 or shifting into a new phase perhaps, less intense. There is nothing new to see here, and yet it\u2019s a deeply felt film, romantic and earnest about childhood. Though I have to admit I found the subtitling hard to follow in places; the dubbed version might be a better choice, especially for younger audiences.The narrator is called Roma; he is remembering the summer when he was 15, living on a farm. The other kids in the village laugh at him, and call him \u201ccow dung guy\u201d. His best friend is serious, hardworking Toto (Y\u00fbki Kaji) who has been away at school in Tokyo. Now Toto is back for the holidays with a new boyband haircut and a slight air of disdain for his country bumpkin friend. The pair have been inseparable for years; they built a secret den in the woods and called themselves the Don Glees gang (the name is explained later).While Toto was away at school, Roma buddied up with another kid, nicknamed Drop (Ayumu Murase), small for his age, wild with a mischievous grin. The moment Drop mentions \u201cthe hospital\u201d with glistening eyes, it\u2019s pretty obvious where his storyline is headed.The Don Glees pride themselves on their amateur fireworks \u2013 which are highlight of the gorgeous animation, along with a spectacular starry night sky. But this summer, the gang\u2019s display is accused of causing a forest fire. So they pack up their rucksacks and head to the mountains where they hope to find a drone that will prove their innocence. Not one scene here is likely to surprise, but what a lovely, unashamedly emotional and affectionate look at friendship. Goodbye, Don Glees! is released on 30 November in cinemas.","335":"College freshman Alia (Sophia Ali) returns home to her affluent New Jersey suburb and the tight-knit but judgmental Indian diaspora community. But the weekly party scene and the gossipy speculation about marriages and infidelities begin to pall after she stumbles on her parent\u2019s secrets. Meanwhile, romance blossoms with the son of the new owners of the local grocery shop.India Sweets and Spices is peppy, energetic and unapologetically broad in its comic approach. But the burgeoning romance is markedly less interesting than the relationship between Alia and her mother (Manisha Koirala), a conservative housewife with a radical secret past.In cinemas now","336":"A gender-switched riff on Stand By Me sounds like an intriguing idea \u2013 a dead body is discovered by four pre-teen girls \u2013 and interesting things do happen in this film at first, in that it declines to conform tonally to what you expect; and yet the quirky-dreamy YA style persists. However, there is something uncertain and soft-centre about what follows, and the plot unrealities make it very silly.Lola (Sanai Victoria), Mari (Eden Grace Redfield), Daisy (Madalen Mills) and Daisy (Lia Barnett) are four best friends in an American suburb, whiling away the long hot summer before they start middle school. Rambling aimlessly through some woodland outside town, they are stunned to discover the corpse of a man, and find themselves mostly reluctant to tell the police or their parents: they want to savour this bizarre, rare secret and also realise that once the alarm is raised, they will be fiercely questioned and feel like they are in trouble even though they aren\u2019t.This paralysis brings its own complication: the longer they leave it after the discovery, the more trouble they will indeed be in. It\u2019s a sound, shrewd psychological insight. But then they move the body and discover a receipt from a bar (that time-honoured pulp-thriller plot move) and go there on a cute detective-jaunt to find out who the corpse was. Daisy even borrows her mum\u2019s gun and gets to fire it at a padlocked door \u2013 all without consequences. Did she ever return the gun to her mum? Who knows?The dead man may symbolise the looming concept of maleness in their lives, the absent or emotionally unavailable father (only their mums are shown on screen). Or maybe he symbolises the looming relevance \u2013 or irrelevance \u2013 of boys. Either way, the ending is a tiresome new-agey cop-out and a lot of viable ideas have gone to waste. A disappointment. Summering is released on 2 December in cinemas.","337":"Nushu is a traditional secret writing system used by women in Jiangyong county in China\u2019s Hunan province: slender, diamond-shaped characters they used to vent their frustrations and record their inner lives. This haunting but slyly subversive documentary about three present-day nushu specialists uses the practice to examine women\u2019s changing roles in a China modernising at breakneck speed \u2013 though the forces of resistance are evident in the numerous episodes of impressive mansplaining surrounding this female preserve.A prize-winning nushu expert working at a Jiangyoung museum, Hu Xin frets about how the essence of the art is being watered down in dance-based presentations demanded by tourists. She believes it deals at heart in \u201cmisery\u201d \u2013 and so looks up to wizened calligrapher He Yanxin, who raised her four children solo, as her inspiration. Hu has left her violent husband, but despite her high status in nushu, deems her own family-less existence a failure. Meanwhile, soprano singer and fellow nushu fanatic Wu Simu is preparing for marriage, but an uneasy look comes into her eye when her fiance dismisses her passion as a \u201chobby\u201d.The powers-that-be are alighting on nushu as a unique artform with wider commercial value in the push to promote Chinese culture \u2013 but always in sanitised form. We see nushu banners hanging in a sort of finishing school\/Princess Camp for young girls. One spectacularly misjudged proposal is to use the writing to brand \u201chigh-end potatoes\u201d. Even ordinary folk seem to struggle to define it in non-patriarchal terms. One visitor at a Macau tourist expo appreciates seeing the characters on men\u2019s clothing: \u201cIt makes me feel women are taking care of men. And I like that message.\u201dMatters come to a head for Wu when her big-smiling beau tells her to forget nushu and ready herself for pregnancy. The plaintive song that follows (\u201cWhite cloth wrapped around my feet \/ A handsome boy visits my home\u201d) is withering in its commentary. He\u2019s never seen again, and she chooses to pursue her craft and later unveils twin poems \u2013 one old, one of her own \u2013 that show the evolutionary possibility for nushu: making the cramped rebellious impulses of long-dead women echo with female solidarity and independence today. This is a deft act of historical revival. Hidden Letters is released at Bertha DocHouse on 2 December.","338":"A young Indian American woman Alia (Sophia Ali) rolls her eyes at her mother\u2019s generation in the affluent New Jersey community where she grew up. The aunties, she jokes, are a bunch of \u201csari-wearing zombies\u201d, only interested in shopping and gossiping about who\u2019s getting married and who\u2019s getting fat. Alia\u2019s assessment of her mum \u2013 and her own privilege \u2013 are the subject of this extremely likable mother-daughter comedy with a smart script from Geeta Malik, who has said in interviews her affectionate send-up is semi-autobiographical.Alia is back home for the summer holidays planning to chill. Her dad Ranjit (Adil Hussain) is a successful doctor; her mum Sheila (Manisha Koirala) is devoted to keeping up appearances. All the families in their world take it in turns to throw fancy parties, trying to outdo each other with the catering. On a whim, Alia invites the Duttas, a family who\u2019ve just taken over the local south Asian shop, to a party at her parents\u2019 house (mainly because she fancies their son Varun, played by Rish Shah). It\u2019s a clumsy thing to do: her dad is appalled (\u201cwho next, the gardener?\u201d). At the party, the other guests are frosty and condescending towards the \u201cshopkeepers\u201d.Malik\u2019s script has interesting, awkward things to say about class: Alia is completely oblivious to her privilege, and unexpectedly it turns out that Mrs Dutta (Deepti Gupta), knew Alia\u2019s mother from university in Delhi; they were political activists together. The impossibility of ever really knowing our parents is a familiar storyline, but it\u2019s told here with real generosity and warmth. Malik slyly pokes fun, but never meanly. This is satire with the thermostat turned up to 22 degrees. India Sweets and Spices is released on 2 December in cinemas.","339":"This artfully made, borderline-despicable French drama revolves around Leo (K\u00e9vin Mischel), a brooding, lonely taxi driver with cheekbones sharp as dressmaker\u2019s shears, a secret talent for musical composition, romantic longings for pretty dancer Am\u00e9lie (Aur\u00e9lia Poirier) and the uncontrollable urge to kill women. Whether he actually does that or not isn\u2019t clear at first, since scenes where he murders one woman turn out to be fantasies \u2026 or are they?In a way, this film seems to not care either way because it\u2019s essentially much more interested in Leo and his mental anguish: anguish that is seeded by a former chanteuse mother (Dominique Frot) who beat him when he was little. The whole handsome-tragic-murderer shtick is one we\u2019ve seen before in an assortment of films, from Peeping Tom and Taxi Driver to Kim Ki-duk\u2019s Bad Guy \u2013 but at least writer-director Marc Fouchard brings a few offbeat touches that add some fresh texture. For a start, Am\u00e9lie, Leo\u2019s object of obsession, happens to be deaf which means she can\u2019t hear the music Leo has written and plays in the car, which one customer complains about rudely. But deafness doesn\u2019t stop Am\u00e9lie from being an expressive, mesmeric dancer, and the bits where she performs are some of the best passages of the film.Elsewhere, Fouchard\u2019s blurring of the lines between reality and fantasy and fluid editing are genuinely adept and very disturbing, enough to make one look forward to seeing what he does next. Music, as befits a film about a composer and a dancer, is skilfully incorporated into the plot and the bits of music that Leo is supposed to have written (actually composed by Pascal Boudet, AKA Cyesm), are indeed rather lovely, little cycles of repetitious patterns that earworm inside your head, much like the film itself. Out of This World is released on 5 December on digital platforms.","340":"Here is a movie that could so easily collapse into self-satire, especially at the first sneery-knowing intonation of the word \u201cmilady\u201d, a phrase probably now most associated with Parker from Thunderbirds. But the commitment and passion of its two lead performers, Emma Corrin and Jack O\u2019Connell, carries this new version of DH Lawrence\u2019s Lady Chatterley\u2019s Lover, and the actor turned director Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre finds the keynote of idealism. The film is never shy of eroticism and full-on sex, if sometimes going for a slightly quaint soft-focus approach. But Clermont-Tonnerre is never in any doubt that this is a love story. The last adaptation of any note was from another French film-maker, Pascale Ferran\u2019s flawed Lady Chatterley (based on an earlier version of the book). Perhaps it takes a French and not a British director to respond to Lawrence\u2019s forbidden tale of forbidden love.It is the middle of the first world war and Constance Reid (Corrin) is the beautiful and impulsive young woman of upper-class birth and progressive views who, after a chequered emotional past, honestly believes herself to be in love with Sir Clifford Chatterley; they get married before he has to return to the front, hardly knowing each other at all. At the war\u2019s end, he is a gloomier figure, using a wheelchair after a terrible war injury, and it is in a sombre mood that the new Lady Chatterley is to arrive with him at Wragby, his vast country estate, paid for by the sweated labour at his colliery.There, she is alienated from the friends he invites up from London for the weekend. Sir Clifford is a shallow, meretricious figure: after dabbling in writing fiction, he throws himself into making his colliery even more profitable by laying off some miners and exploiting the rest more ruthlessly. This impotent plutocrat is coldly obsessed with producing an heir, making it clear to the bewildered Constance that he will permit her to have a discreet affair if that produces the correct result. As it happens, Constance has become obsessed with the handsome gamekeeper, Mellors (vehemently played by O\u2019Connell, who maintains his character\u2019s dignity). He is the only person in her life capable of human sympathy.Hypocrisy as well as sex is what supercharges the story. Sir Clifford is quite content for Constance to stray as long as it is with someone of the right class. But the film shows how Constance is a hypocrite herself: she initially considers using Mellors to get pregnant without considering his feelings. But their relationship and their sensuality become an almost religious revelation to them both. Love and sex, two things taken so casually for granted in so many different kinds of story, here become totemic articles of faith. Lady Chatterley still has the power to move.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotion Lady Chatterley\u2019s Lover is released on 25 November in UK cinemas and on 2 December on Netflix.","341":"A 70th-anniversary rerelease for this film by a masterly French director who is known for his craftsmanship \u2013 but deserves also to be known for his artistry. Jacques Becker\u2019s Casque d\u2019Or is a gripping tragic drama of Parisian lowlife set at the turn of the century, based on news stories and apocryphal tales of the \u201capache\u201d criminal gangs that roamed the Paris underworld in the belle \u00e9poque, terrifying and titillating those wealthy boulevardiers who liked to slum it in seedy dives.Simone Signoret is glorious as Marie (nicknamed \u201cCasque d\u2019Or\u201d for her golden helmet of hair); she is a woman of the night, based on the \u201cgigolettes\u201d tempting gentlemen into dark alleys, who would then be beaten and robbed by the woman\u2019s male accomplices lurking behind her. Marie, though, never does anything so cruel here and has a heart, as well as a hairstyle, of gold. She is currently kept by Roland (William Sabatier), a sneery and insecure criminal, who takes offence in a bar when Marie likes the look of a quiet, personable carpenter called Georges (Serge Reggiani), who is going straight after some time inside and not looking for trouble. Marie and Georges fall deeply and tenderly in love, to the rage not only of spiteful beta-male Roland but his sinister gang-boss, Leca (Claude Dauphin), who uses his wine business as a respectable front and a means of bribing cops and is also enamoured of Marie. He has a plan to get this low-rank rival out of the way by having him convicted of murder.Like Renoir and Oph\u00fcls, Becker has a knack of creating densely and vividly achieved visual set-pieces and extravagant, involving drama. Scene follows scene seamlessly and the screen is flooded with detail and incident. Becker uses real locations which have the immediacy of the New Wave Paris movies; perhaps this is the reason for Truffaut admiring Becker so passionately. The tragedy is shot through with a kind of knowing black comedy: a doltish young waiter, who is an inconvenient witness to Leca\u2019s criminal affairs, is killed in a mysterious street accident, after which Leca organises a solemn whip-round for the boy\u2019s tearful grandma.There is also a lovely setpiece when Georges and Marie, loved up and wandering the rural streets in postcoital bliss, tiptoe into a church where a wedding ceremony is taking place, and Becker creates a droll tableau of the bourgeois guests in their finery and the uncomfortable looking bride and groom. Georges himself looks uneasy and sceptical: does he sense that a wedding and a happy ending is not in his future?Casque d\u2019Or leads up a great coup de cin\u00e9ma: the final, mysterious sequence in which Marie appears to want to rent a certain room for a stomach-turning reason. In earlier scenes, Signoret usually gets an ethereally lit soft-focus closeup: but not now, in this pitilessly grim finale. This is an unmissable classic.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotion Casque d\u2019Or is released on 25 November in cinemas.","342":"The first one was good \u2026 this one is better: an ingenious, headspinningly preposterous and enjoyable new whodunnit romp featuring Daniel Craig as the legendary detective from the deep south, Benoit Blanc. Writer-director Rian Johnson has established his own murder-mystery working model, positioned equidistantly between the Agatha Christie approach, in which the culprit is revealed at the very end, and the Columbo approach, in which it happens at the very beginning. Here, as in the first film, the guilty party\u2019s identity gradually emerges in the second half \u2013 not so much a twist as an unfurling pirouette. But Johnson and his enigmatic, drawling sleuth keep us guessing.Edward Norton is an insufferable tech bro called Miles Bron who has become a multitrillionaire through his stake in Alpha, an online network fusing data, news and cryptocurrency. He invites a whole bunch of pals and fellow \u201cdisruptors\u201d to his private island with its giant domed building called the Glass Onion for a murder-mystery themed party: these include politician Claire Debella (Kathryn Hahn), supermodel turned designer Birdie Jay (Kate Hudson), YouTuber and men\u2019s rights activist Duke Cody (Dave Bautista), scientist Lionel Toussaint (Leslie Odom Jr) and \u2013 most uncomfortably of all \u2013 Cassandra Brand (Janelle Mon\u00e1e), who had the original idea for Alpha but was ousted from the company by Miles and his lawyers with hardly a dollar.But also among the guests is Benoit Blanc himself. Bron says he didn\u2019t invite Blanc, but lets him in anyway, amused by whatever prank his guests are apparently playing on him. His idea is that someone will fictionally \u201ckill\u201d their host and the guests have to figure out who and why. Things turn deadly serious and of course the ashen-faced guests turn to Benoit to save them.Glass Onion is never anything less than entertaining, with its succession of A-lister and A-plus-lister cameos popping up all over the place. And Johnson uncorks an absolute showstopper of a flashback a half-hour or so into the action, which then unspools back up to the present day, giving us all manner of cheeky POV-shift reveals. Craig\u2019s outrageous leisure-themed outfits are a joy and Mon\u00e1e gives a tremendously likable comic performance as the woman with more than one secret to reveal and more than one grievance to hold against Norton\u2019s loathsome Musk-ish plutocrat.

The first film\u2019s central figure Ja-yoon (Kim Da-mi, briefly returning here) began to exercise her telekinetic powers only two-thirds of the way into Part 1\u2019s narrative. However, Part 2\u2019s heroine Ark 1 (Shin Sia-ah) is, from the off, able to throw whole cars around and beat people up psychically, having been raised in a secret facility where her superpowers were genetically implanted from birth. But Ark 1 was never socialised like Ja-yoon, the latter having been adopted by kindly if elderly normie farmers at a young age, so a lot of the time is spent watching Ark 1 adapt to regular life after she is taken in by young farmer Kyung-hee (Park Eun-bin) and Kyung-hee\u2019s brother Dae-gil (Sung Yoo-bin). (In relatable fashion, she loves the food samples in supermarkets.) The farmers are being menaced by an uncle (Jin Goo) who wants to forcibly seize their farm, but like almost all the men in this film, the gangsters profoundly underestimate the power of slight young women such as Ark 1, Kyung-hee or, indeed, Ja-yoon herself.If you grasped all that without having seen Part 1, you\u2019ll notice that the plot is a bit like a Korean version of Stranger Things, with Ark 1 as The Witch\u2019s version of Eleven, the lab-reared victim-prodigy with extraordinary psionic powers. Writer-director Park Hoon-jung has also grafted on a subplot reminiscent of Orphan Black that involves a bunch of telekinetic young people in rival gangs who are connected to the story. They\u2019re all ridiculously good looking and super-cool, like the members of competing K-pop bands but with extremely murderous instincts. (Bear in mind: the film is extremely gory and has deservedly been given an 18 certificate.)In the film\u2019s more comic moments it explicitly links the biologically altered transhumans to the developed world\u2019s fetishisation of beauty. For example, when tough tracker girl Jo-hyeon (Seo Eun-soo) is flatteringly described as having \u201crebel eyes\u201d by a rival (Lee Jong-suk), she, in turn, praises his lovely skin, which is indeed cosmetic-advert perfect. He brushes off the compliment, saying it\u2019s only genetics, and indeed nearly everyone\u2019s looks and powers are \u201conly genetic\u201d in this world. But satire is much less the point than good old-fashioned ass-kicking and special effects, all smoothly executed and doled out in bite-size scenes. The Witch: Part 2 is released on 28 November on digital platforms.","344":"Succession director Mark Mylod has an acute eye for the absurdity of extreme privilege. So the preposterous world of haute cuisine is almost too easy a target: not so much about eating as worshipping at the altar of the chef\u2019s ego. The chef in this case is Ralph Fiennes, sporting joylessly immaculate whites and an expression of patrician displeasure. The guests at his culinary temple, run with a cult-like devotion by the ferocious front of house manager Elsa (Hong Chau), are a tasteless bunch: a trio of braying investment bankers, a needy movie star, a miserable wealthy couple trying to buy some meaning into their lives. And then there\u2019s Margot (Anya Taylor-Joy), the last-minute date of foodie fanboy Tyler (Nicholas Hoult). Margot is more interested in sneaking a cigarette than fawning over chef\u2019s sous vide technique. She is the one errant ingredient in the evening\u2019s menu.Subtle it\u2019s not, but it\u2019s maliciously entertaining. It turns out that revenge on the ultra-wealthy is a dish best seared over a naked flame.","345":"When so much current movie-making is risk-averse, sanitised, cinema by consensus, you have to admire a film that takes such an ambitious and unfettered approach to storytelling. You don\u2019t, however, have to like it. I\u2019ve watched Alejandro I\u00f1\u00e1rritu\u2019s latest \u2013 the wildly uneven, Fellini-esque Bardo, False Chronicle of a Handful of Truths \u2013 twice. That\u2019s a little shy of six hours of my life (I\u00f1\u00e1rritu cut about 20 minutes from the film after its premiere). It\u2019s audacious, bold film-making, a highly personal work that is cluttered with symbolism and bloated with self-regard. It is, very occasionally, brilliant: a deft reveal in the final 20 minutes ties together the disparate, seemingly unrelated scenes that came before. But with its overuse of fish-eye lenses and the quacking, whimsical brass-heavy score, it\u2019s extremely hard work.In cinemas now and on Netflix from 16 December","346":"Queens, 1980. The way James Gray tells it in this bustling, tobacco-hued autobiographical drama, it\u2019s an in-between world, on the brink of the cultural explosion of hip-hop and the political paradigm shift heralded by Reaganism. But it\u2019s also rooted further in the past and in the Jewish family history of Gray\u2019s alter ego in the picture, sixth-grader Paul Graff (impressive newcomer Banks Repeta).Paul is flirting with the notion of teen rebellion \u2013 he triggers a family argument with his unilateral decision to order Chinese food rather than to tackle his mother\u2019s baked fish (\u201cIt\u2019s called scrod,\u201d says his mother, swilling the word around her mouth like something she would prefer to spit out). At school he bonds with Johnny (Jaylin Webb), a Black kid who delivers the kind of scorched-earth comebacks to teachers that make the other children gasp with delighted horror. Paul wants to be an artist; Johnny would like to work for Nasa. And for a while, both ambitions seem achievable.The family scenes, all jostling banter and suffocating love, are terrific. Anne Hathaway is a frazzled mother whose status on the school PTA is not quite the power-play Paul believes it to be; Anthony Hopkins dispatches twinkly wisdom as a much-loved grandpa; Jeremy Strong is the disciplinarian dad with a whiplash temper. Preteen drama is amplified by robust and fairly obvious musical choices, but more interesting is the sound design: the city is everywhere, grumbling and fractious, the sound of a short fuse burning out. A brief, felted moment of silence allows Hopkins\u2019s potent final line to land like a punch.","347":"Earlier this month, the debut feature from Scottish-born, New York-based writer-director Charlotte Wells picked up a whopping 16 nominations for the British Independent Film awards, an impressive haul second only to Saint Maud\u2019s record-breaking performance in 2020. It\u2019s easy to see why Aftersun has generated such excitement since premiering at Cannes in May. A brilliantly assured and stylistically adventurous work, this beautifully understated yet emotionally riveting coming-of-age drama picks apart themes of love and loss in a manner so dextrous as to seem almost accidental. Don\u2019t be fooled; Wells knows exactly what she\u2019s doing, and her storytelling is as precise as it is piercing.We meet young, separated father Calum (Normal People\u2019s Paul Mescal) and his 11-year-old daughter, Sophie (screen newcomer Frankie Corio), on holiday together in Turkey in the late 1990s. Sophie is smart for her age (she and Calum are sometimes mistaken for siblings) but she\u2019s still also very much a child, torn between hanging out with the younger kids at the resort or with the more boisterous teenagers who lounge around the pool table. As for Calum, his outward calm seems to cover demons of denial; a trancey energy that threatens to break through the placid surface of his current life, dragging him back into a more chaotic \u2013 or euphoric \u2013 existence (Moonlight director and Aftersun co-producer Barry Jenkins describes Calum as \u201cwading through wells of quiet anguish\u201d).Scrappy DV-cam footage offers apparently concrete evidence of the interactions between Sophie and Calum, with both roles being performed with quite breathtaking naturalism. Yet Aftersun is constructed as a very personal recollection, filtered through a haze of memory and imagination by the now-adult Sophie (Celia Rowlson-Hall) looking back on things she didn\u2019t really understand at the time. That tension between fact and fiction \u2013 between recorded and remembered events \u2013 draws us deep into the drama, causing us to examine every frame as if searching for clues to a hidden truth that remains tantalisingly elusive. It often seems as if the real story is playing out beyond the edges of the frame, dancing in the shadows beyond the confines of the screen. Plaudits to editor Blair McClendon, who juxtaposes scenes and images in almost hyperreal, dreamlike fashion, conjuring a magical space in which time seems to bend emotionally.Appropriately for a work that is clearly profoundly personal, Wells says the roots of Aftersun lay in flipping through holiday albums of herself as a child and being struck by how young her father looked. Later, she came across a photo in which she was sitting by a pool in Spain, with \u201ca very beautiful woman right behind me\u2026 and it made me wonder who the real subject of the picture was\u201d. That sense of mystery runs throughout this mesmerising feature, which, despite being set largely in the past, nonetheless feels peculiarly present.Some of the groundwork for Aftersun was laid in Wells\u2019s 2015 short film Tuesday (she has called this \u201ca sequel of sorts, in a different place and time\u201d). There\u2019s more than a hint of the tactility of Lynne Ramsay\u2019s early works, with short films such as Gasman (1997) and features such as Ratcatcher (1999) clearly serving as inspirations. Just as Ramsay has an almost uncanny ability to capture the texture of memories on screen, so Wells showcases a Proustian talent for transporting the audience back into a world they didn\u2019t actually experience, while making them feel like they did. There are also clear traces of the films of Margaret Tait in Wells\u2019s craft, specifically Blue Black Permanent (1992), which seems to have served as a tonal reference (a volume of Tait\u2019s writings is prominently displayed on screen).Gregory Oke\u2019s cinematography captures the colour of memory, with bright exteriors and glowing surfaces carefully graded by Kath Raisch to evoke vivid snapshots of fleeting moments. Composer Oliver Coates weaves his way in and out of the film\u2019s emotional labyrinth, while deftly chosen needle drops (including a mashed-up vocal version of the Queen-David Bowie hit Under Pressure) put us right there in the moment.","348":"The English translation of the title of C\u00e9dric Klapisch\u2019s latest could be a little more evocative. The original French title, En Corps, is a kind of double entendre, both something related to the body and also the company of a dance troupe. Appropriately so, as this film is all about the self-discovery journey of Elise (Marion Barbeau), a classical ballet prima donna who struggles to reclaim her place in the dance world after breaking her ankle on stage.Her affliction is emotional as well as physical; it occurs right after Elise discovers that her dancer boyfriend is cheating on her. When told that she might never perform again, Elise is ready to accept her fate. Nevertheless, while staying at an artists\u2019 residency in Brittany as an extra pair of hands in the kitchen, Elise finds her way to healing \u2013 both physically and mentally \u2013 through mixing with a contemporary dance group.While the supposed dichotomy between classical ballet and contemporary dance feels naive and rather simplistic, there is a life-affirming quality in how the film captures the recovery process: it is not a solitary act but a communal one, as the healing of Elise\u2019s body is made possible only by being among the collective of other creative souls. For a first-time actor in a feature film, Barbeau, a trained ballet dancer in the Paris Opera, gives a beautiful performance that communicates the emotional interiority that exists in the physicality of dancing \u2013 bringing to mind Moira Shearer in The Red Shoes (1948). Although Rise stumbles occasionally in the humour department, Barbeau\u2019s presence is nothing short of a star-making turn. Rise (En Corps) is released on 18 November at Cin\u00e9 Lumiere, London.","349":"Movie stars, bemused by their own magnified faces, don\u2019t usually have much interest in self-analysis. Paul Newman turns out to be the ruthlessly candid exception. In the late 1980s, between beery binges, Newman recorded endless hours of reminiscences, trying finally to understand the insecure, inadequate stranger who skulked behind his handsome facade. Probably alarmed by what he\u2019d revealed, he later destroyed the tapes. But after his death in 2008, 14,000 pages of transcripts were discovered in his musty Connecticut basement and in a storage locker; these have now been cut and pasted into an autobiography, supplemented by contributions from colleagues and family members. The result is startling: Narcissus breaks the mirror, leaving only some cruelly jagged shards.In the early 1950s, Newman seemed the most unthreatening of Hollywood\u2019s angry young men \u2013 less eruptive than Marlon Brando, less twitchy than Montgomery Clift, less surly than James Dean. Tempering the fury unleashed by the others, he played a redeemed hoodlum in Somebody Up There Likes Me and an introverted outlaw in The Left Handed Gun. Eventually, as a wise-cracking robber in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and a playful gambler in The Sting, he settled down to be wry and irresistibly charming. But his book hardly mentions roles like these; instead, he ridicules \u201cthis goddamn movie star with blue eyes cast as a half-Apache in Hombre\u201d. Overcome by a sense of unworthiness that festers into self-contempt, he calls himself \u201cthat decorative little shit\u201d, a merely ornamental creature with an empty centre.His mother takes most of the blame. Her crime was to adore him, as the fans he cold-shouldered later did. She dandled him like a doll and he compares himself to the lapdogs she stuffed with chocolates until they \u201cbecame so cancerous and obese they could hardly move\u201d. Stifled by her cosseting, he refused to reciprocate affection and developed a protective \u201ccarapace of indifference\u201d. That explains why many of his later performances \u2013 for instance as a defecting cold war scientist who switches off his emotions in Hitchcock\u2019s Torn Curtain, or a cynically amused private eye in The Drowning Pool \u2013 can seem blandly detached.Like the alcoholic husband he played in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Newman relied on liquor to ease him into a merciful numbness. He has a crackpot theory, probably concocted when he was sloshed, which maintains that the British never get as drunk as Americans do because they like warm beer and don\u2019t put ice in whisky, which means that their bodies have no need to heat up the alcohol they consume to blood temperature before it can be absorbed. \u201cMy whole system,\u201d he says, \u201cwas based on catching up with those ice cubes.\u201d It\u2019s a shrewd comment on his emotional refrigeration: those blue eyes do often seem glacial.In Newman\u2019s telling, he chaotically improvised his way through an unscripted life. At college, he organised panty raids on sororities, in the navy he boozed. Obliged to find work, the best he could manage was a modelling job in \u201ca cover shoot for a detective magazine\u201d. He blundered into a first marriage without rehearsing the sex: \u201cWe waited,\u201d he groans, \u201cuntil the wedding night\u201d, when they immediately conceived a child. With his second wife, Joanne Woodward, he took direction from what he calls \u201cthis thing I carried around in my trousers\u201d. Attending classes for method actors, who were expected to draw on their emotional memories when on stage, Newman realised that he \u201cdidn\u2019t know enough about my own feelings to start examining them\u201d.Danger ejected him from this state of anaesthesia. Hence his obsession with racing cars, which began with a movie role as a grand prix driver in Winning but took him \u201coutside that fictional experience into something real and quite primitive\u201d. More culpably, he also urged his son, Scott \u2013 an addict and an unsuccessful actor, with whom his relationship was \u201ca dance of death\u201d \u2013 to take high-speed risks on the road. At one lacerating moment, Newman recalls that he considered shooting himself to rid Scott of \u201cthe affliction that was me\u201d; in the event, it was the unhappy Scott who died prematurely.Given this psychological record, Newman refuses to take credit for his much-praised philanthropy. Although the salad dressing sold as Newman\u2019s Own generated millions for charitable causes, he winces at the way he marketed his celebrity on the shelves of grocery stores and suspects that his altruism came \u201cfrom having no civic impulses at all, just inventing them the way I invented everything\u201d. Presumably that also applies to his political activities in support of candidates who opposed the Vietnam war; though he voted Democrat, Newman defines himself as \u201can emotional Republican\u201d \u2013 hard faced and self-contained or, as a college crony says of him, \u201ctough and cold\u201d, even \u201cdevilish\u201d.Two of Newman\u2019s daughters, contributing a foreword and afterword, claim that after recording the tapes he became \u201cmore present\u201d in his remaining years. That\u2019s good to hear, but it\u2019s easy to see why he decided back then not to publish the agonised testimony. Praising Newman\u2019s performance as a fearful, drink-bleared lawyer in The Verdict, Robert Altman remarked that \u201che shows you his pink places\u201d.

In 2014, Reyes was at his day job as a California court interpreter translating for a defendant: Sans\u00f3n Noe Andrade, a young Mexican immigrant who was to be convicted for first-degree murder having been the driver for a drive-by gang shooting, conducted by his 15-year-old brother-in-law. Andrade got life without parole, having denied guilt and denied gang membership; he insisted he was reluctantly giving his brother-in-law a lift out of politeness with no idea of his intention. Andrade had turned down a plea bargain, but then made a bad impression on the jury by claiming not to have heard any gunshots.Later, Reyes entered into a correspondence with Andrade, who was to tell him he refused any deal because he was scared of gang reprisals (although his brother-in-law took a deal) and still insists he was not a gang member, though had to join up once in prison for his own safety. So Reyes made it his mission to create a film based on Andrade\u2019s unhappy life, using an actor, Gerardo Reyes, to play Andrade\u2019s adult self and reconstruct their jail-visit conversations on the stage of a cinema in front of a blank screen. More audaciously still, Reyes got Andrade\u2019s sister and brother-in-law to play his parents in reconstructions of his troubled childhood in the Mexican town of Tecom\u00e1n, with his nephew Antonio, or To\u00f1ito, playing his pre-teen self.Soon it becomes clear that this real family is experiencing exactly the same pressures and miseries and young To\u00f1ito might well wind up going the same way. Inevitably, the director puts his own life in parallel with Andrade\u2019s and suggests if things had gone another way, his life might have come out like this. Maybe: although the real parallel is between Andrade and To\u00f1ito. A very sobering inquiry. Sans\u00f3n and Me is released on 18 November at Bertha DocHouse, London.","351":"Hearts audibly sink when Sid Straw (Tony Hale) cranks up his chummy banter. His colleagues can barely bring themselves to make eye contact when he attempts to engage; his sister-in-law has all but banned him from family events. So when Sid claims to have been college friends with The Hunger Games star Elizabeth Banks, there\u2019s a degree of cynicism, which is not helped by the fact that social media neophyte Sid inadvertently and very publicly starts bombarding her with cringey messages.The picture goes full bore on the skin-crawling creepiness of Sid\u2019s slow-motion car crash into internet ignominy \u2013 it\u2019s amusing, in a fist-chewingly uncomfortable way \u2013 but it then attempts to redeem the character in the final act, not wholly successfully.On digital platforms from 14 November","352":"Acclaimed documentary maker Matthew Heineman is known for his remarkable ability to stay close to subjects caught up in dangerous situations \u2013 be those fighting the drug trade in Latin America (Cartel Land), defying Isis occupation (City of Ghosts), or struggling to care for the sick during the Covid pandemic (The First Wave). This latest feature-length chronicle lays out an extraordinary insider\u2019s view of the last months of the United States\u2019 war against the Taliban in Afghanistan, as seen from the point of view of the last Green Berets supporting the Afghan army led by Gen Sami Sadat. While those filmed, especially the local soldiers, clearly disagree with America\u2019s withdrawal from the region, the film itself tries to maintain a posture of journalistic neutrality. Still, just like the American soldiers who must keep repeating that it\u2019s not up to them, you can sense that Heineman and his crew recognise they\u2019re watching a tragedy unfold.Footage of the chaos at Kabul airport in August 2021 when crowds of desperate Afghans tried to secure places on the last American planes to leave bookend the film. Even if you were glued to the news when it was happening, you won\u2019t have seen anything quite like the shots Heineman and his co-cinematographers capture here. Soldiers clumsily fire guns into the air, sort of, to scare off the hordes, and people claiming to have been translators, liaisons and support workers for the US military desperately wave paperwork trying to get through the line.The material in between, covering roughly eight months leading up to the final evacuation, is almost serene in comparison, although the tension is still palpable. The crew captures footage of the combined forces using drones and remote-controlled weapons to take out Taliban personnel. However, the sheer relentlessness of the Taliban\u2019s determination becomes clear, as Sadat and colleagues see their control of the country erode piece by piece. It seems almost frivolous to note this, but the hyper high-definition cinematography is both beautiful in a savage way and adds immediacy to the viewing experience. Retrograde is released on 11 November in cinemas.","353":"The Hunger Games\u2019 Elizabeth Banks is an unexpected choice as the muse of this Canadian comedy-drama, adapted from Michael Kun\u2019s pre-social media-era novel about a sadsack software worker\u2019s obsession with Heather Locklear \u2013 who, to be honest, was more front-and-centre than Banks in the zeitgeist of her day. Debut director Scott Abramovitch\u2019s gentle film is less a look at digital-age fandom than an affable primer on accepting your own unremarkableness.Sid Straw (Tony Hale) is pootling along in his job as VP of marketing at a generic firm, waving\/drowning on the midlife dating scene, and irritating his sister-in-law Janet (24\u2019s Elisha Cuthbert) with his try-hard perkiness. So when he is called to organise a college reunion, he spies a golden opportunity to bolster his standing: by persuading his famous one-time pal Elizabeth Banks to attend. He begins leaving messages on her Facebook page, oversharing about his personal life and invariably signing off with \u201cEat wheaties!\u201d; the special farewell the future Hollywood star would shout out to the volleyball team.But the hapless desk-jockey doesn\u2019t realise the posts are public. As Sid\u2019s professional life unravels, Hale forestalls what might have been a satirical pile-on with deft attentiveness to the nerves and eagerness to please behind the droopy moustache. He\u2019s helped by Abramovitch\u2019s fastidious characterisation, perhaps left over from its literary origins; there is lived-in detail everywhere, including a voicemail scene reminiscent of Swingers, in which Sid\u2019s hands-free attempts to call \u201cKate, My Girlfriend\u201d end up in \u201cRay\u2019s Skate Land\u201d.There\u2019s a kind of bravery in having Sid remain an unfailingly nice guy, even when his world is collapsing and he calls on the service of a slovenly lawyer (Paul Walter Hauser). But maybe giving him some darker traits, a hint of stalker obsession, would have pushed Dear Elizabeth\u2019s comedy into something more radically funny, instead of just being briskly amusing. The sitcom-ish direction drags it further in the direction of complacency, but Hale and the focused writing ensure it has a kind-hearted integrity. Dear Elizabeth is available on digital platforms on 14 November.","354":"This LA-set breakup comedy at least has a nifty hook: when a longstanding couple part ways, who gets drinking rights at their favourite bar? After five years together, flannel-shirted carpenter Allen (Luka Jones) and go-getting talent agent Nina (Melissa Fumero) are undergoing what Los Angelenos now call a \u201cconscious uncoupling\u201d. Having never fought when they were together, their separation proceeds on the same smooth lines \u2013 until they set foot in the Martinez Bar & Lounge on the same evening, both on the town as singletons for the first time. Staff allegiances are divided, so they come up with a decider: Allen and Nina have to undergo a best-of-three bar challenge, with the loser \u201ceighty-sixed\u201d for good.Debut director Jim Mahoney gets a tasty buzz on in the early stages, couching Bar Fight! as an upbeat Californian Christmas affair in the Shane Black tradition, with a rhythmical snap in his stride as the characters face off in front of the counter. He tries to make the Martinez a Cheers-style home-from-home, with boozy dramatis personae including soft-touch manager Dick (Vik Sahay), silver-tongued barman Mason (Daniel Dorr), and 1,000-yard-stare cook Elena (Dot Marie-Jones).These mini-dramas are interwoven with the central competition, yet Mahoney goes weirdly light on the main rivals\u2019 backstories. There is some character development in a jarringly wistful last stretch, when Allen\u2019s stuck-in-the-mud nature and Nina\u2019s restlessness come to the fore. Deprived of this extra depth for most of the runtime, Bar Fight! coasts on not-especially-interesting challenges (trike-racing; blindfolded darts) and smug snark, exemplified by Nina\u2019s wingwoman Chelsea (Rachel Bloom) egging her pal on to \u201croot some dicks\u201d. (She seems to have drunk Steven Stifler\u2019s dregs.) Bar Fight! wants to be the best night out of your life, but \u2013 mistaking dodgy drunken acting for ambience \u2013 it feels pretty ersatz throughout, like one of those pseudo-Irish bars that has bought in all its decor. Bar Fight! Is available on digital platforms on 14 November.","355":"Hatz\u00edn is an adolescent kid from Mexico City, first met arriving in northern Mexico near the US border. Played by Hatz\u00edn Navarrete \u2013 at the time of casting a non-professional actor \u2013 he\u2019s there to collect the remains of his father, a man he barely knew, who was seemingly killed in an industrial accident. Offered a box and an identification card with a barely discernible photo of the dead man, Hatz\u00edn sets off on the long journey back, but changes his mind and jumps off the bus when he sees a man who looks like the picture on the ID card. Hatz\u00edn is convinced with possibly irrational fervour \u2013 the film never makes it quite clear if he\u2019s deluded or not \u2013 that this is actually his father, who is now only pretending to be someone named Mario. Mario keeps trying to brush the kid off, gently at first and then with more force when he just keeps coming back.Like Jacob in the Old Testament who insisted on wrestling with an angel until he blessed him, Hatz\u00edn wins the struggle eventually but pays a price for it. Mario (Hern\u00e1n Mendoza) takes the boy in under his wing and puts him to work in his sleazy business recruiting people to work under brutal conditions in the local garment factories. There\u2019s a very telling moment that says a lot about postcolonial capitalism when Mario rallies potential recruits by saying that their real enemy is the Chinese; they, he argues, will put their own children to work, taking advantage of their tiny hands, leaving Mexicans and Latin Americans like themselves in poverty unless they compete.Director Lorenzo Vigas, who collaborated on the script with Paula Markovitch and Laura Santullo, adeptly manoeuvres things so that the film slides effortlessly from mystery to criminal story to quasi-Greek tragedy, changing registers with subtle alterations of tone. The landscape \u2013 vast, desiccated, menacing \u2013 is practically a character in its own right, full of inscrutable secrets like Hatz\u00edn\u2019s own deadpan face. The kid barely cracks a smile but he has an incredible presence, and genuine chemistry with the more experienced Mendoza; the latter projects a charisma that\u2019s understandably compelling to the boy. Be warned though: this is the kind of film where there are drawn-out shots in which nothing happens other than a speck of vehicle or person in the distance trudging from one corner of the screen to the next, which might try the patience of more fidgety viewers. Released on 11 November on Mubi.","356":"Not to be confused with the recent Netflix hit series, this is in fact a very solidly engineered Hitchcockian throwback. Company man Karl Glusman and resting actor Maika Monroe are the upwardly mobile young Americans relocating to a Bucharest bolthole boasting a prominent picture window; with hubby out schmoozing clients, his better half has time enough to dwell on a gruesome local murder spree, and the silhouetted figure peering down from an adjacent property. Suspicion shifts and moves closer and closer to home, but on one point Chloe Okuno\u2019s film remains resolute: these characters would have avoided a lot of grief had they invested in net curtains.As recently as Wes Craven\u2019s Red Eye in 2005, we could take this species of medium-budget runaround for granted. Yet Watcher offers not just relief that it exists, but actual, genuine, old-fashioned thrills. Striding confidently into studio terrain after contributing to last year\u2019s V\/H\/S\/94 horror anthology, Okuno works up a muted style and aces the setpieces: retooling passing extras as peripheral threats as the sound design goes right through you. She has punched up an underlying psychology in Zack Ford\u2019s script: the wife\u2019s mounting fears compounded by frustration at a Rational Spouse seeking to explain them away as girly misunderstanding. (Glusman\u2019s heroically regrettable moustache offers its own grounds for divorce.)Okuno describes this gaslighting for what it is, and that permits us the rare privilege of a mainstream thriller heroine who actually errs on the side of caution throughout. As in 2014\u2019s It Follows, Monroe is no pushover, and her reward for persistence, amid the nicely unpredictable finale, is a \u201ctold you so\u201d moment for the ages. Unimprovably brisk at 91 minutes, Watcher is not messing around \u2013 and probably won\u2019t hang around long in cinemas with starry awards fare in the offing. But a few more of these nifty diversions, and the multiplexes might once again be a viable night out. Watcher is released on 4 November in cinemas.","357":"Here is an admirable documentary about the brilliant life and tragic death of author and journalist Lyra McKee, shot dead in 2019 at the age of 29 by a stray bullet from the New IRA as she covered riots in Derry\u2019s Creggan estate. Apart from being a grotesque homicide, perpetrated by swaggeringly unrepentant and clumsy extremists, the McKee killing represented a culture clash and a generational collision. An inspirational young LGBTQ writer, McKee came from a Republican community in Belfast, had written on depression among the post-Good Friday generation, challenged the UK government\u2019s line on the 1971 Ballymurphy massacre, confronted homophobia in Catholicism and Islam, investigated the class inequality of the new peace dividend and \u2013 perhaps most importantly of all \u2013 started on what was set to be her first major work, a book entitled The Lost Boys, a study of the children who went missing during the Troubles, almost certainly in each case because they were witnesses to terrorist crime.McKee was a young, fearless writer, a world away from the macho gangsters of old-school terrorism who still plied their trade, in thrall to the paranoia and buried shame which McKee understood but they didn\u2019t. Moreover, McKee was a product of new media; she went directly to the riots when she heard about them, a first-hand observer instantly tweeting and shooting video, very different to the mainstream Troubles coverage of yesteryear.The film gives a vivid and heartfelt portrait of this remarkable young woman, hearing from her family and her partner, with whom she first bonded over their love of Harry Potter. The film ends by pointing out that her funeral, which by general acclaim had become a virtual state occasion, was the first time the major politicians had met since the collapse of power sharing, and expresses the hope that her memory might be instrumental in restarting dialogue. Let\u2019s hope so. This article was amended on 3 November 2022 to remove an inaccurate comment about BBC and ITN coverage of the Troubles. Lyra is released on 4 November in cinemas.","358":"It\u2019s Saturday morning, the rain outside is relentless, the TV is on but the remote is nowhere to be seen \u2013 it\u2019s likely down the back of the sofa. You\u2019re stuck watching children\u2019s cartoons, sucked in by the bright colours and high-stakes, save-the-world narratives. One Piece Film: Red is in this great tradition: a sugar rush of stunning animation, great music and a strong central story with frequent stretches of utter nonsense.The One Piece franchise centres on Monkey D Luffey and his crew of pirates; this one-off adventure introduces us to Uta, a beloved, stadium-packing singer from Luffey\u2019s past who turns renegade and attempts to use her special powers to trap her fans in an alternate universe. The pirates work to take her down \u2013 and then a lot more happens as several dozen new characters and new subplots sputter and zigzag with little concern for cohesion. Narrative discipline is not the first concern here, but the core story about Uta and her motivations is emotionally resonant.A feast for the eyes and ears, every frame is decked with colour and detail. The final showdown is a sensory assault and is akin to watching a fireworks display \u2013 colours swirl and things go bang. There are musical numbers throughout, each accompanied by eye-popping, rainbow-dripped visuals that reel you back in when the plot loses you. The songs themselves are marvellous: performed by Japanese musician Ado, they stand their ground against current chart-toppers and justify the idea that Uta is the world\u2019s most popular singer. When focused, this film truly sings, but it takes its time and tests your patience to land on the right notes. One Piece Film: Red is released on 4 November in cinemas.","359":"This whirling, churning, exhaustingly busy \u2013 but lavishly produced \u2013 Korean action-thriller film is directed by and stars Lee Jung-jae, who played the down-on-his-luck protagonist Seong in Squid Game. Although he\u2019s been a big name for years in South Korea, starting out as a heartthrob in the 1990s, his current fame in the west probably explains why the film was selected for Cannes and other festivals this year. That means it\u2019s available to audiences who probably won\u2019t know the historical context vital to understanding the plot. It\u2019s worth some pre-viewing brushing up on South Korea in 1983, when the film was set \u2013 the regime was deeply repressive at the time and the country was riven by internal protests, while tensions with North Korea were (literally) explosive.If you keep all that in mind and think of this as a John Le Carr\u00e9-style story, set in Asia and on speed, it makes a bit more sense. Lee plays Park Pyong-ho, the chief of the foreign unit of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA), who is locked in a power struggle with his counterpart Kim Jung-do (Jung Woo-sung) from the domestic unit of the KCIA \u2013 especially after president Chun Doo-hwan is almost assassinated while visiting the United States. It turns out there is a North Korean mole operating within the KCIA, and both Park and Kim are assigned to head competing teams to find out who it is.Some shocking twists go off like well-timed bombs in the back half of the film, somewhat compensating for what is, in all honesty, a bit of a slog. Lee himself is charismatic as ever, and as a director has a flair for the action, stunts and kinetic aspects of film-making. He seems less assured as a screenwriter, given what a muddle this turns out to be \u2013 crammed with incident and all just a bit too much. Hunt is released on 4 November in cinemas and on digital platforms.","360":"In writer-director Shana Feste\u2019s muddled midnight movie Run Sweetheart Run, life is a string of misogynistic slights for Cherie (Ella Balinska), a young single mother trying to make it at a male-dominated, female-assisted Los Angeles law firm. From unwanted groping on the bus to inappropriate behaviour at work, the men surrounding her are as blunt as they are unashamed of it, a familiar-to-many daily grind she\u2019s accustomed to yet aggrieved with.When a scheduling mishap leaves her boss double-booked for the night, Cherie is asked to take his place meeting a client, scrambling together a last-minute babysitter and a last-minute outfit. Cherie is pleasantly surprised when she meets Ethan (Borgen and Game of Thrones alum Pilou Asb\u00e6k), who is handsome and friendly, a balm after yet another day of shitty men, but as their date goes from restaurant back to his extravagant home, things go from very nice to very, very nasty.Feste, a film-maker typically associated with earnest non-genre fare like the Gwyneth Paltrow music drama Country Strong and teen romance Endless Love, has described Run Sweetheart Run as \u201cGet Out for women\u201d, a refreshingly honest confession that her film is very much part of the, at times, exhausting increase in so-called social horrors. It\u2019s a hugely difficult subgenre to get even half-right, something that\u2019s been underestimated by many since Jordan Peele\u2019s gamechanger, and Feste\u2019s admirably ambitious attempt settles at about a quarter, her film working best in the early stages when the emphasis is more on social and less on horror.Even before the film slides into gory, full-tilt mayhem, the world is already a scary place for Cherie, who, like many women, is made cruelly, almost constantly, aware that male danger lurks around the corner. It\u2019s an unsubtle escalation but effective nonetheless because, well, sexism so often is unsubtle and Balinska, a Charlie\u2019s Angels survivor, is a warm and empathic actor who doesn\u2019t struggle to get, and then keep, us firmly in her corner. When the micro-aggressions turn macro, Feste makes a decision to censor the violence inflicted on her heroine, a laudable course correct to the many, many films that excitedly indulge in women in pain, but one that involves a fourth wall removal that clangs. So too does Feste\u2019s repeated use of on-screen text that tells her lead to \u201cRUN!\u201d whenever things get dangerous. These big swing B-movie flourishes feel that much more discordant given how so much of the film around it is made without the same sense of flash.As the running begins, the script, co-written by playwright Keith Josef Adkins and newcomer Kellee Terrell, starts to, ahem, run out of steam, devolving into extreme and extremely divisive silliness, in ways that can be charmingly goofy but most often not. The difficulty of balancing a genre film \u201cthat\u2019s really about _____\u201d is that when you\u2019re trying to say something about a real tangible issue using an absurdist device, the gap between your ability to master the two, between familiar fact and fantastical fiction can end up making or breaking your point. In Get Out, Peele proved himself to be as adept at one as he was at the other, landing the far-out nuttiness of the reveal after such careful groundwork. I was also reminded of how ferocious and focused Mimi Cave\u2019s similarly themed thriller Fresh was earlier this year, a film that also turned the horrors of dating and everyday sexism into actual horror, confidently gliding from coercive to cannibalistic behaviour. But here, the switch to gonzo hokeyness is far harder to stomach or even understand, edging the film away from a thriller-horror and further into comic book fantasy.By the time a vampy Shohreh Aghdashloo has turned up as an age-old mystical being using menstrual blood to save the souls of targeted women while telling us that the Adam and Eve story is in fact a lie, it\u2019s hard to know what to think or how we even got here. It\u2019s difficult to fault a film for being over-ambitious given the low-effort nature of so many genre films but the sheer, two-joints-in bizarreness of Run Sweetheart Run needed a surer hand to guide us through. As it is, that run to the finish line ends up feeling like a crawl.Run Sweetheart Run is available on Amazon Prime on 28 October","361":"Adrian Sibley\u2019s documentary now gets a touring theatrical release in the UK and the Republic of Ireland: a revised and recut version differing from the original version shown at the Venice film festival, about which I had some reservations.Revisiting this film is in fact no great hardship for me: it was a pleasure to be reminded of Harris\u2019s great performances in movies such as This Sporting Life and The Field, and his extraordinary (and extraordinarily successful) detour into chanson-style pop singing in the late 60s. But it is interesting that this new cut of the film gives a much fuller account of Harris\u2019s ferocious consumption of cocaine, which I thought the film originally glossed over in favour of a more sentimentally traditional booze narrative when it came to discussing that picturesque concept of \u201chellraising\u201d \u2013 although in both versions I liked Harris\u2019s contemptuous refusal to be cowed or psychoanalysed: he indulged because he loved it.This documentary is better for this new emphasis and it gives a fuller context for the complex emotions now being expressed by his grownup sons, the boys for whom Richard had a passionate and poignant love, but from whom he was so often estranged by divorce and by his Hollywood career. Actor Stephen Rea gives a very interesting and alarming account of how dangerous and violent Harris\u2019s acting could be (especially, perhaps, when he wanted to put a younger guy in his place) and director Jim Sheridan is frank and forthright about how difficult the great man could be.Watching this documentary for a second time reminded me of my feelings when I saw him in 1990 playing the lead in Pirandello\u2019s Henry IV on the London West End stage, experiencing at first-hand that charisma, that lion-in-winter defiance.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotion The Ghost of Richard Harris is in UK cinemas now with an Australia date to be confirmed.","362":"Luxuriating in a wealth of archival material that encompasses radio and TV interviews, privately recorded conversations from reel-to-reel tapes (Armstrong could swear like a sailor), and good old-fashioned newspaper clippings (remember them?), this documentary about the great Louis Armstrong is a real keeper. Fans of the legendary jazz trumpeter are likely to complain that a mere 104 minutes is not enough to cover such a complex, innovative character whose career spanned decades and hope there will someday be a supercut that goes on for hours. But in a way this swinging, 4\/4, 135 beats per minute biography-cum-essay crams a lot into its running time and makes relative brevity its virtue. Like one of Armstrong\u2019s great solos, it feels packed with dynamics, sprinkled with astonishing high notes, and immensely pleasurable.As with so many docs these days, there are very few talking heads, and instead director Sacha Jenkins opts to layer the sound of unseen speakers over film clips and rostrum shots. One welcome exception is a wonderful sequence where the camera slowly tracks in on actor Ossie Davis as he recalls observing Armstrong when the musician thought no one was looking. The million watt smile was turned off, and he seemed like the saddest man in the world. There are revealing snippets of observation from maestros such as Wynton Marsalis, Miles Davis, Leonard Bernstein and more, as well as bits of Armstrong\u2019s writings read by the rapper Nas. Among all the deeper insights there is plenty of juicy gossip and weird trivia, covering everything from Armstrong\u2019s well-spent youth playing music in brothels, his generosity towards fans (he gave away coal to the poor at some gigs), his taste for marijuana and devoted use of laxatives. Who knew?Jenkins doesn\u2019t exactly parse material into specifically labelled chunks, but there are distinct thematic groupings here: they cover, for example, Armstrong\u2019s musicianship, his rise to fame, his ambivalent relationship with the white hegemony that ran the music and film businesses, the civil rights movement, and so on. Indeed, there\u2019s a jazzier approach here at play than the usual straight-up chronological plodding of so many bio-docs. Consequently, the film skips from one year to another and back again, weaving and darting from idea to comment with an editorial fleetness that may be a little overpowering for some. But it\u2019s not like there aren\u2019t scads of secondary sources out there if you want to know more about Satchmo, or Pops, as he\u2019s called. The film also represents an excellent primer for younger viewers who might only know Armstrong from, say, his cover of La Vie en Rose in Wall-E. Louis Armstrong\u2019s Black & Blues is released on 28 October on Apple TV+.","363":"When Matthew Jacobs\u2019s name is first displayed on screen in this likable documentary, he is identified as a \u201cmid-level screenwriter\u201d; it\u2019s more of a self-deprecating description than a diss given that he is one of the film\u2019s co-directors (along with Vanessa Yuille) as well as the feature\u2019s star subject. But his filmography is a mixed bag, and includes several things you may never have heard of (Bar America and the cartoon Justin and the Knights of Valour), little remembered reworkings of established works (a 1994 version of Lassie, Young Indiana Jones TV movies), the original story for one of Disney\u2019s least popular works (The Emperor\u2019s New Groove), the film adaptation for one stone-cold British cult classic (Paperhouse, 1988), and the script for 1996\u2019s Doctor Who: The Movie.That last title is the prompt for this doc in which Jacobs, with some initial trepidation, ventures into the tight-knit world of Doctor Who conventions and events. Jacobs\u2019s leeriness of Whovians \u2013 who mostly come across here as cuddly, sweet-natured people, no weirder than Star Trek Trekkies or My Little Pony Bronies \u2013 stems from the fact that many have professed to hate Doctor Who: The Movie because in it the Doctor (Paul McGann) reveals that he\u2019s half-human and at one point snogs his companion Grace (Daphne Ashbrook). These deviations from Whovian lore seem to trouble the fans less when they meet the gentle-natured Jacobs, an Englishman living in the US who has his own bone-deep ties to the Who franchise. Eventually, it\u2019s revealed that not only did his actor father play a role in one of the oldest episodes, from 1966, but that Matthew visited the set as a little boy.But that happy memory turns out to be one of the few peaks in what was otherwise a pretty miserable-sounding childhood, an upbringing marred by parental mental illness. That making this film provided Jacobs some kind of closure is nice, although as a movie it\u2019s a little ramshackle and repetitive. A few of the interviewees try to define why Doctor Who means so much to them, and why departures from the canon mean so much, but the movie never quite wraps its arms around the whole phenomenon.It\u2019s also very skewed towards the costume-wearing US end of Whovian fandom: the cultural disconnect between them and British fans in the birthplace of the story might have added some ballast. Still, at least in one amusing aside, an interviewee notes that if you go to a Doctor Who event in the UK the attendees, given Brits\u2019 reluctance to dress up in public, will look as if they were just rounded up at a bus stop. Doctor Who Am I is in cinemas from 27 October.","364":"Descendent, Margaret Brown\u2019s documentary about the search for America\u2019s last known slave ship, begins with a distant figure kayaking through a sun-dappled swamp. Green leaves blanket the water\u2019s surface and the rower\u2019s strokes are slow and meditative. Nothing to see here, just a man \u2013 a Black man, we gather, as he glides closer \u2013 in nature, accompanied by the buzz of insects and the lone egret that is keeping watch. It\u2019s a strikingly bucolic beginning for a work about so devastating a subject. We\u2019re in for something different here, is the film\u2019s opening gambit. It\u2019s an unspoken promise that Descendent lives up to.Brown, a white native of Mobile, Alabama, returned to her hometown to record the search for the Clotilda, believed to be the last slave ship in American history. Produced by Barack and Michelle Obama\u2019s Higher Ground production company along with Questlove (a descendant of enslaved people on the Clotilda), the film is a layered and slyly defiant portrayal of a community saddled with a shared history of unspeakable tragedy and violence. The treasure in this story is not a sunk vessel, as the interviews with its more literal-minded subjects might suggest, but a sense of justice and equilibrium that has been denied to a people that have been passing down their trauma from one generation to the next.In 1860, more than half a century after the slave trade was abolished, Alabama landowner Timothy Meaher is said to have made a bet that he could smuggle a slave ship without being caught so he orchestrated the capture of 110 Africans from what is now Benin. The enslaved people were made to wait out two weeks in the Alabama swampland before being divided into three groups and smuggled to their purchasers. Meanwhile, the Clotilda was burned and sunk to conceal the crime.Five years later, when slavery was abolished, the Meaher family cooked up another repugnant scheme: rather than take responsibility for their crime and provide for the newly freed people, they spun a profit from them, selling them parcels of land in an undesirable area three miles north of downtown Mobile, where zoning rules would accommodate industry to this day. This quarter, presently cut through by an unsightly highway and swarmed by factories and harmful pollutants, is now called Africatown. The enslaved people, and their children and grandchildren, were told that they\u2019d be lynched if dared breathe a word of what had happened. Passing down an oral record has been their only way of preventing their own erasure.Brown follows the ship\u2019s retrieval, but it\u2019s the mostly white teams of scuba divers and historians and investigative reporters who get starry-eyed talking about scanning historical records for clues and dredging procedures. The Africatown community is more circumspect about the search party. \u201cI don\u2019t want the momentum of the story to be just about the ship,\u201d says Joycelyn Davis, who has childhood memories of refuse from the paper plant raining down \u201clike snow\u201d on her school playground, and who recently survived a cancer diagnosis.With Zac Manuel and Justin Zweifach\u2019s stunning cinematography and her own good sense not to place herself in the story, Brown delivers a powerful meditation on damage. Descendant serves as a stark reminder that \u201cdamage control\u201d is a contradiction in terms.Midway through the film, the search team informs an assembly of Africatown residents that they have found the Clotilda. Those gathered offer dim applause and nod their heads. Their expressions are cautious, troubled.For all its cultural currency, closure can be a mixed bag. The eventual discovery of the ship\u2019s remains inspires local news segments and the introduction of a new \u201choliday\u201d \u2013 the governor of Alabama can\u2019t personally make it to a convention of Africatown residents, but sends an emissary to proclaim that 8 February 2020 shall go down in history as \u201cHonor the Descendants of the Clotilda Day\u201d. Joycelyn Davis is seen sitting on a bench at the Smithsonian, facing an indoor fountain that is part of the permanent Slavery and Freedom exhibition. Davis doesn\u2019t look too appeased. Reflect all we want, this is a story that will never sit well.Descendant is now available on Netflix","365":"Hold your nerve and your stomach: this gorefest is almost too good to pass out while watching it. Making headlines for apparently causing cinemagoers to faint and vomit, with an ambulance reportedly called to one screening, Terrifier 2 is not for everyone, but this tasteless wonder meets nauseating expectations. Blood, guts, molars and tendons fly across the screen with reckless abandon. No body part is safe from Art the Clown, a Pennywise on bath salts who treats the human body like a diamond-stuffed pi\u00f1ata, each blow and decapitation unearthing intestinal bounties and gushing reserves of liquid ruby.In between scenes of bodily mutilation, there is a plot \u2013 just about. High school student Sienna Shaw (Lauren LaVera) prepares a costume, designed by her late father, for a Halloween party. The night before, Sienna has a vivid dream in which she encounters a rampaging Art, fending him off with fire. For some reason, this also causes a fire in her bedroom. The following day, Sienna and those around her face the deranged clown in the flesh.The creative ways bodies are hacked to bits is the film\u2019s only truly inventive aspect. These scenes are long and unobscured. Victims are left wailing in pain as they become Art\u2019s plaything. Despite the bloodshed, the impressive practical effects help ensure the film is absurd fun instead of outright cruel, more in the vein of The Evil Dead than the torture-porn of Saw.The tacked-on commentary about the perils of unsupervised screen time and the gratuitous nature of true-crime entertainment, with namechecks for Jeffrey Dahmer and Ted Bundy, are hardly original, and the runtime is at least 40 minutes too long, but the commitment of the cast, and jaw-dropping scenes of flesh being turned inside out makes Terrifier 2 catnip to a certain audience.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotion Terrifier 2 is on digital platforms from 24 October.","366":"The 80s classic gets a Halloween re-release for its 40th anniversary: a supernatural chiller and anti-gentrification satire that came out the same year as ET \u2013 Mr Hyde to that film\u2019s Dr Jekyll, perhaps \u2013 and one of the most Spielbergian films not actually directed by Steven Spielberg. It is also a movie with its own particular flavour of sadness, owing to the early deaths of two of its stars: Dominique Dunne, daughter of author Dominick Dunne and niece of Joan Didion, killed in the year of the film\u2019s release by her violent ex-boyfriend, and Heather O\u2019Rourke, who died in 1988 at 12 years oldafter suffering cardiac arrest and septic shock connected with a bowel condition.It was directed by horror maestro Tobe Hooper, who claimed to have had the basic story idea himself; nonetheless, the credited lead screenwriter and producer is Spielberg. Spielberg\u2019s auteur fingerprints are all over Poltergeist, but some of the residual creepiness and brashness must be Hooper\u2019s \u2013 particularly the scene in which one of the \u201cghostbusters\u201d rather gratuitously claws his own face off. Yet there is a key moment where these two film-makers\u2019 sensibilities fuse.The story takes place in a new suburban housing estate in California, a classic Spielbergian habitat of kids Edenically riding around on their bikes, making mischief with their remote-control toy racing cars. Steve Freeling, played by Craig T Nelson \u2013 later to be the voice of Mr Incredible \u2013 is an employee of the property company that has been putting up these homes on the site of a former 19th-century settlement. He has evidently been rewarded with living in one of these state-of-the-art houses. Go-getting salaryman Steve is bit of a Ronald Reagan fan (he\u2019s seen reading the president\u2019s biography in an early scene). His fresh-faced wife, Diane, played by the excellent JoBeth Williams, has maybe has more of a Carter-era hippyish background, and is seen smoking a joint while the couple loll around on the marital bed. (Post-coitally?) They have a smartmouthed teen daughter Dana (Dunne), a younger son Robbie (Oliver Robins) and a blonde-haired angelic infant daughter Carol Anne (O\u2019Rourke).It is young Carol Anne who is to sense something strange in the TV which (in that distant broadcasting era) stops transmitting after the national anthem is played last thing at night and the screen goes to a fuzzy white noise. Reassuring patriotism is replaced by evil. Approaching the TV screen, putting her face right up close to the set, she senses something there, something which only she can see and which invades their happy home.There are some classic moments in Poltergeist. When Steve invites the three paranormal specialists to his home and shows them up the stairs to the closed door of his haunted bedroom, he listens dumbly to one of these experts frowningly explaining how some objects can move by millimetres over hours \u2013 then opens the door to reveal furniture flying wildly around the room. And it gives us one of the great creepy moments of 80s film history when Diane takes her eye off the kitchen for a second, then looks back to see all the chairs suddenly piled in a heap on the tabletop.The keynote of the film is O\u2019Rourke\u2019s eerie, ethereally pale face, illuminated by the unearthly light of the haunted TV. Her expression, with its faint and worrying smile, gives us a very Spielbergian close-encounters-type awe. But there\u2019s something else as well: a disturbing hint that she has in some sense been seduced by the forces in the TV. There is a tiny, ambiguous touch of the devil child in her toothpaste smile: a coming together of Spielberg and Hooper. Poltergeist would be nothing without O\u2019Rourke. The movie builds to two separate outrageous exorcism climaxes and a horrible disclosure about how Steve\u2019s property company has been ruthlessly maximising profit from the land and cutting costs. Poltergeist\u2019s special effects may look a little hokey now, but this film can still throw the furniture around.

It is set on a gloomy English seafront and intercuts between the buttoned-up 1950s and the late 1990s. As an earnestly intended drama I can imagine it being performed on stage at a weekday matinee, the climactic speeches echoing wanly around the auditorium. But in its contrived way, it conjures a very English sort of shame.Screenwriter Ron Nyswaner has adapted the novel by Bethan Roberts, itself inspired by the famous m\u00e9nage between novelist EM Forster, Forster\u2019s policeman lover Bob Buckingham and Bob\u2019s wife, May. Linus Roache and Gina McKee play ageing married couple Tom and Marion, respectively a former police offer and retired schoolteacher. To Tom\u2019s dismay, Marion has taken a local resident into their home to be cared for by her as part of a volunteer outreach programme: cantankerous stroke survivor Patrick, played by Rupert Everett.But Patrick is no stranger: 40 years previously, he was the elegant museum curator and gay man (in an age when homosexuality was a criminal offence) who fell passionately in love with Tom and began a secret relationship with him, just as poor, shy, muddled Tom was courting Marion, hardly understanding anything about his own sexuality and certainly nothing about Marion\u2019s, whose motives for taking him in now are fraught with guilt. Young Patrick is played in flashback by David Dawson, young Marion by Emma Corrin and young Tom by Harry Styles \u2013 who is not at all a bad actor, better than he was in Don\u2019t Worry Darling, with a rather assured on-camera presence. His line-readings are a bit decelerated, perhaps as a result of coaching, but he has an interestingly melodious delivery. It reminds me a little of Mick Jagger\u2019s movie acting.The film shows how much in this era depended on the importance of discretion, the grim hypocrisy dance of knowing and not knowing. And Patrick keeping a diary in which he swooningly refers to Tom as \u201cmy policeman\u201d is indiscreet, as is his (absurdly) brazen decision to take Tom on a business trip with him to Venice.The modern-day parts of the film are not fully realised: older Tom and Marion are too accustomed to a life of reticence to voice their feelings: stroke-patient Patrick cannot speak anyway, and the dissolve-fade transitions to their shared tremulous past are a bit on the nose. But even in this constraint there is a certain kind of poignancy. I would like, perhaps, to see Grandage dramatise the famously tragicomic final domestic set-up of the ageing Kingsley Amis, cared for by his first wife, Hilary, and her husband, Lord Kilmarnock. My Policeman is released on 21 October in cinemas and on 4 November on Prime Video.","368":"The Exhibition on Screen has done sterling work over the years offering cinemagoers and (in its cut-down, small-screen format) TV viewers an excellent simulacrum to the experience of visiting a major art gallery. While its output has generally concentrated on the blockbuster names of the art world \u2013 a commercially potent mix of impressionism, post-impressionism and the high Renaissance \u2013 here is a welcome deviation from the norm: an impressive biography of American master Edward Hopper, whose quiet, precise and somehow otherworldly painting responds particularly well to Exhibition on Screen\u2019s house style.This Hopper documentary is not anchored to a specific exhibition, but still presents the customary mix of loving close-ups of the paintings, knowledgeable talking heads, and voiceover readings of original letters and diary entries. (There\u2019s some nicely effective soundtrack music too, eerie and mournful by turns.) Hopper\u2019s difficult early years are described, and then elevation to glory after meeting his future wife, Josephine Nivison. Considerable attention is given to some of Hopper\u2019s less well-known works \u2013 the bizarre Soir Bleu from 1914, the equally mysterious Two Comedians, from the other end of his career in 1966 \u2013 though most attention is lavished on key paintings of isolation and alienation: Automat, Chop Suey, Office at Night, Nighthawks.There has, however, been considerable revisionism of the Hopper story in recent years, and this film is not afraid to tackle it: partly concerning Hopper\u2019s refusal to engage with the teeming multicultural streets of his home base, New York City, which was undergoing enormous social change around him, but more substantially with the oppressiveness of his treatment of Nivison, who encouraged and supported his work in the early days but found her own already-established career as an artist stymied and thwarted by his disapproval. Others have been more outspoken about the toxic nature of Hopper\u2019s attitude, but there\u2019s plenty of material included here that reinforces Hopper\u2019s spitefulness even as he was dependent on her; the film\u2019s title, while not entirely ironic, certainly points up their difficult relationship. Inevitably focus remains on him, but Nivison would make a rich subject for another film. Hopper: An American Love Story is released on 18 October in cinemas in the UK, and on 20 October in Australia.","369":"Despite a (potentially) interesting central character and a genuinely confrontational and uncomfortable opening scene, this feature from artist and film-maker Martine Syms spins its wheels dramatically, with indulgent, undirected performances and ideas. It is archly knowing about the art world, yet never quite earns its putative status as satire: a movie about someone graduating from art school that itself feels like a graduation project.The contemporary artist and writer Diamond Stingily (who has collaborated with Syms on other work) plays Palace Bryant, a young woman of colour about to undergo a viva voce exam from an uptight panel of advisors as part of her MFA degree. Some of them are supportive, some uneasy and one is openly sceptical about Palace\u2019s claims to be creating work that engages with her African heritage. \u201cWhere\u2019d you grow up?\u201d she asks pointedly, a question to which Palace responds by calling her a racist. Yet later, at the graduation party, there will be hilariously derisive talk among Palace\u2019s friends about other people\u2019s claims to authenticity: \u201cShe\u2019s not from Belarus \u2013 she\u2019s from Las Vegas!\u201dPalace is clearly as well-read as any of the faculty or fellow students on her subject and we later find out that she appears to be exhibiting at the Venice Biennale, and yet she is also coolly laidback with everyone she meets, all the people crowding up to her, wanting to talk to her, hang out with her, have sex with her, or just be with her at that evening\u2019s party, which Palace is not keen to attend. Palace shows a politely wry bemusement in the face of everyone else\u2019s excitable behaviour, but exactly what she wants and feels is mysterious. Stingily is relaxed and amiable, but in acting terms there may be nothing else there and the film doesn\u2019t develop in any interesting direction. The African Desperate is available on 21 October on Mubi.","370":"Featuring non-professional actors from the Indonesian island of Java, this beguiling \u2013 and occasionally muddled \u2013 debut from the Spanish director \u00c1lvaro Gurrea treads the line between fiction and ethnographic documentary. Suddenly abandoned by his wife Olive, Yono (Yono Aris Munandar), a sulphur miner at the Kawah Ijen volcano, struggles to win back his beloved. His efforts range from the spiritual to the capitalist: the forlorn husband is willing to dabble in shamanic spells as well as cryptocurrency.Moments of beauty quietly emanate from the film\u2019s penchant for static compositions. Engulfed in billowy clouds of hazardous sulphur fumes, Kawah Ijen is at once majestic and terrifying. As the camera often keeps its distance from the characters, the islanders are at times rendered simply as impersonal pieces of a tableau vivant. These vignettes of life in Java, though pleasing to look at, are sometimes emotionally alienating: Gurrea\u2019s film is prone to aestheticising its subjects instead of meaningfully inhabiting them.The final third, however, is wonderfully lifted by more spirited scenes where Yono discusses his dilemma with friends and other miners. Nevertheless, this is also where the film\u2019s difficulty in wrapping itself up becomes apparent. Perhaps such problems stem from a shaky understanding of the island, considering that the narrative restlessly jumps from knotty family dynamics to a simplistic dichotomy between spiritualism and exploitation. When Yono finally grabs the camera and turns the lens on himself, this sense of the subject\u2019s autonomy comes too late. This film aims to feel reminiscent of work by Apichatpong Weerasethakul or Lav Diaz, but \u2013 despite the title \u2013 it\u2019s lacking a distinct soul. Ancient Soul is available on \u200b\u200b14 October on True Story","371":"Alan Rickman\u2019s voice was a purr, but it masked sharp claws. This was evident in the memorable baddies he played and now you can hear it in the feline prose of these selected diaries. \u201cJohn Major said, \u2018You have given us so much enjoyment.\u2019 \u2018I wish I could say the same of you,\u2019 was the unstoppable reply. He had the grace to laugh.\u201d You suspect not everyone did. Rickman didn\u2019t suffer fools and his intelligence keeps chafing against his fellow professionals \u2013 their self-absorption, their vanity, their unresponsiveness. He snipes and then regrets it. After a barney with his latest director he writes: \u201cHow can I curb this ability to distance and intimidate?\u201dIt was an ability that casting directors noted and audiences loved. His smarmy cleric Obadiah Slope in the BBC Barchester Chronicles and his vulpine seducer Valmont in the RSC Les Liaisons Dangereuses were early delights, though he was already in his 30s, a late starter. He wrote to Rada when he was 26 after initially pursuing a career in design. He hit pay dirt in 1988 as Hans Gruber in the immortal Die Hard, holding a skyscraper to ransom while running a malevolent eye over his to-do list in a Filofax. I had never seen a suaver, funnier screen villain and I still haven\u2019t. (Orson Welles\u2019s Harry Lime is the only one who comes near.) These diaries begin five years later when he\u2019s famous and famously picky. He turns down another script with this: \u201cWould not require acting \u2013 just getting on with it while the camera has a look.\u201d If a script wasn\u2019t up to snuff he would change it, as he admitted doing for his Sheriff of Nottingham in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. It won him a Bafta.It also made him rich and an unexpectedly keen shopper. He loves buying clothes and popping into Conran for what he calls \u201cgift items\u201d. The boy who grew up on a council estate in Acton had a taste for the high life, and he and his long-term partner Rima Horton are regularly on the move between London, an apartment in New York and a house in Tuscany. They holiday in Antigua with Ken and Barbara Follett. Affluence has its downsides, though. When the director Stephen Frears excuses himself from paying in a restaurant (\u201cpredictably\u201d) Rickman writes: \u201cThe general assumption that I will pay the bill is beginning to pall.\u201d As the years go by the company gets ever grander: \u201cTrudie and Sting\u2019s Christmas party. Byzantium meets Fairyland.\u201d \u201cRichard Rogers\u2019s 70th birthday party at the River Caf\u00e9.\u201d \u201cCar to Chequers\u2026 Tony hanging around at the door to talk to me.\u201d One wonders if anyone dared call him a Labour luvvie to his face. Horton in fact served as a Labour councillor and Rickman put his politics front and centre when in 2005 he collaborated with the Guardian\u2019s editor-in-chief, Kath Viner, on My Name Is Rachel Corrie, a play about the American activist killed by an Israeli bulldozer in the Gaza Strip.He is harrowed by bad manners and rudeness, deploring the want of \u201ccuriosity\u201d \u2013 he meant an interest in others. He has sharp words on the matter even for his dearest friends, Emma Thompson, Juliet Stevenson, Ruby Wax. He claims never to have met a curious politician, \u201cone who asks questions rather than makes little speeches\u201d. (He offers the exception of Neil Kinnock.) A certain sighing impatience dogs him and he doesn\u2019t mince his words, at least in private: \u201c15 May, 2004. Jumpers. Stoppard bores me rigid again\u2026 Simon [Russell Beale] needs a smack rather than a director\u201d. He has no illusions about his own repeat role as Severus Snape in the Harry Potter franchise, but it keeps the money rolling in and introduces him to a new generation of fans. He\u2019s not a full-time moaner and will often write something to make you smile: \u201c29 October 2005. Four great words \u2013 I MET TOM WAITS\u201d. His design background didn\u2019t go to waste either. The book\u2019s endpapers reproduce his sweet illustrations and affable handwriting.Great actor that he was, he never starred in a great film. Did he know it? He ought surely to have been Valmont on screen \u2013 they chose John Malkovich, alas \u2013 and he turned down Roger Michell\u2019s fine adaptation of Persuasion. On stage, I saw him twice in Private Lives opposite Lindsay Duncan and rejoiced both times. I spoke to him once at a party sometime in the 1990s, a burst of gush about how much I admired him and he took the praise with the slow-blinking cool of one who was used to it. He died of pancreatic cancer in January 2016, the same week as David Bowie, also aged 69. From his obituaries I got the feeling he was wonderful company. These diaries confirm it.

Two brothers in Delhi, Mohammad and Nadeem (and their humble, faintly put-upon employee Salik) have spent the past two decades on a mission to help the black kite, a commonplace bird that wheels in the skies above the city, but is becoming slowly poisoned with pollution, just as the city\u2019s society is becoming poisoned by sectarianism and hatred. They rescue injured and sick birds and nurse them back to health.The kites themselves are, arguably, not especially delicate or beautiful creatures: they are fierce predators who have become used to scavenging in the city, encouraged by a tradition of \u201cmeat tossing\u201d, and the city\u2019s age-old conviction or superstition that it is good to feed these kites because they eat the sins of those that feed them. Like ravens in the Tower of London, the black kites are thought of as a vital part of the city, a kind of secular holiness. The brothers\u2019 ramshackle animal welfare clinic is dependent on local charity, and they are increasingly stressed and depressed at the lack of support, although a supportive article in the New York Times in 2020 (which presumably inspired this film) does bring in more money.But one brother is thinking of abandoning this vocation and going to study in the US, before it is too late for him to do anything other than this \u2013 so a sadness underlies the film. There is something quixotic in their support for the kites who would otherwise be unsentimentally ignored by the vast majority of people; Mohammad and Nadeem experience something mystical and mysterious in their devotion to the birds, a kind of ritual dedication to their community and to the ideal of interconnectedness. All That Breathes is released on 14 October in cinemas.","373":"Maybe I missed something, but there seem to be several witches in this so-so horror feature. All of them are the not-nice sort of witch: the kind who invade dreams, steal boyfriends, eat children and, in the film\u2019s most delicious scene, wreak cruel and bloody vengeance on guests who spend too long hogging the toilet at parties.Perhaps the title refers to the fact that the film is divided into two slightly overlapping but otherwise standalone parts, each one dominated by a different witch. The first, weaker, story revolves around Sarah (Belle Adams), who\u2019s expecting a baby with her partner Simon (Ian Michaels). A middle-aged woman in a restaurant (Marina Parodi) unaccountably decides to bewitch poor Sarah, giving her all kinds of nightmares that mostly consist of jump scares piled on jump scares; it all starts to feel like one long, not-at-all-jump-inducing scare, and a noisy ghoulish makeup showreel with a loud soundtrack.A couple of supporting characters from the first part (played by Dina Silva and Tim Fox) crop up in the second, a much more confidently handled chapter which revolves around young witch Masha (Rebekah Kennedy, wonderfully creepy). Roommate Rachel (Kristina Klebe) tries to be understanding of \u201cweird\u201d and \u201csort of lost\u201d Masha, but when the latter goes all Single White Female on Rachel the relationship goes south, with inevitably brutal consequences. Although Kennedy\u2019s crazed smile buoys the back half of the film considerably, it\u2019s all pretty episodic and blurry. Two Witches is available on 17 October on Arrow.","374":"Marketing this film as a Blumhouse-style found-footage horror does this genuinely interesting and experimental lockdown effort a bit of a disservice. Conceived during Covid times by Jacob Estes (responsible for the excellent 2004 teen drama Mean Creek) and his children Iris and Lucas, the horror elements are more sweetly vindictive than scary. The film is best described as a kind of pseudo-stalker-flick-cum-Freudian-video-diary-cum-dressing-up-box-raid, with Blair Witch and Lynchian overtones, and a meta fascination in the film-making eye, couched in the shut-in mania of 2020. Just run with it.Iris (Iris Serena Estes) and Lucas (Lucas Steel Estes) find themselves home alone during a mysterious pandemic that affects adults; they are only in technological contact with their hospitalised parents. Being the children of a film-maker and a musician, a pandemic of creativity also runs amok in this household. When teenager Iris isn\u2019t looking after her needy brother, she is painting and vlogging, while he precociously knocks out Clair de Lune on the keyboard. But when ritualistic arrangements of objects begin appearing in the hallway, then clips from a prowler\u2019s point of view show up in her camera roll, she accuses Lucas of taking the DIY projects too far.Modern vlog, Paranormal Activity nocturnal, high-saturated nostalgia, frosted-negative transitions: Estes taps every register in the film\u2019s own artistic spree. But there\u2019s a dark side to it too. Early on Iris finds a note from her father pretending he keeps watch over them as the \u201cCloset Creeper\u201d, implying that the anonymous presence in the videos could be the parental gaze. Or, like a YA version of Peeping Tom or Lost Highway, the forward-grasping compulsion of the film-making urge itself. Maybe all creativity is cursed, as a demonologist explains later on: \u201cThe demon prefers novel and personalised approaches to summoning. Those who create their own ritual with pure and true belief are often the most corruptible.\u201dHe\u2019s Watching gets a bit listless and repetitive two-thirds in, then rallies as the kids try to decipher the object stashes and exorcise this invader. What this stir-crazy, cheeky and wise family album tells us is that true horror for self-authoring, first-person Generation Z seems to be the hectoring dictates of the boring old third person.

Julian Gilbey\u2019s mountaineering drama isn\u2019t just visually resplendent, it also has an impressive tactile familiarity with its milieu \u2013 placing its actors on real rock faces on the Eiger, Matterhorn and Mont Blanc mountains \u2013 that results in super-authentic climbing sequences (at least to this non-climber). Too bad then that it fumbles its dramatic handholds with a risible sub-Point Break storyline about peak-scaling addiction.Thorp plays a Keanu-esque newbie who has quit his finance job to chase the Chamonix dream. Egged on by his loudmouth climbing partner JP (Michel Biel), Michael starts to push his limits on the region\u2019s slopes, starting with the terrifyingly sheer Dent du G\u00e9ant. And, despite initially being whipping boy for weathered American Leo (Ryan Phillippe), he fits right in with the young, dumb and full of kombucha hip local scene \u2013 including a budding hookup with piste-bashing French ski guide Isabelle (Mathilde Warnier).The climbing sequences are genuinely exhilarating: in monumental drone shots homing in on minuscule figures on rock faces and in blow-by-blow crag-side set pieces that demonstrate the film-makers know whereof they speak (even with the odd low-budget shortcoming, such as suspiciously light-looking boulders). And with lightning backlighting alpine vistas in the final storm sequence, you feel right alongside the climbers in a way that even Hollywood big-hitters such as 2015\u2019s Everest struggle with.Best not look down at the story, though, which might have been able to stand up the cliched theme of adrenalised hubris if it hadn\u2019t painted it so cartoonishly. Even the film\u2019s expert free solo climber is at one moment lecturing about respecting the mountain, then arrogantly dynoing two seconds later. (Cue further philosophical finger-wagging from Phillippe, Swayzeing it up.) Warnier, in particular, is left stranded at sea level as the love interest. Aided by its physical clout, Summit Fever does hit a kind of rhythm near the end \u2013 but last year\u2019s The Summit of the Gods is a more substantial look at this kind of obsession. Summit Fever is available on digital platforms on 17 October.","376":"Director Gina Prince-Bythewood plants the bold flags of storytelling and myth-making with this stirring period action movie, inspired by the 19th-century west African kingdom of Dahomey (now Benin) and its Agojie, an Amazon brigade of female warriors tougher and more feared than any men: somewhere between a special forces unit and a praetorian guard for the king.Viola Davis plays Nanisca, the battle-scarred general of the Agojie: tough, disciplined and hyperalert for any sign of attack from their old enemy, the Oyo empire, and worried that the new king Ghezo (John Boyega), who has deposed his brother in a coup, is not sufficiently focused on these things. Nanisca\u2019s loyal lieutenants are Izogie (Lashana Lynch) and Amenza (Sheila Atim) but she nonetheless finds herself strangely preoccupied by a new hothead recruit, Nawi (Thuso Mbedu), who has been effectively dumped on the military by an angry father on account of her resistance to marriage. As two Brazilian aristocrat slavers come to their country, eager to exploit the warring factions who each wish to sell off their prisoners of war into slavery, Nawi is to come of age as a warrior and make a terrible discovery about her past.The Woman King is an interestingly old-fashioned film, with hints of Gladiator and Braveheart, although there is something bracingly contemporary in Prince-Bythewood and her screenwriters Maria Bello and Dana Stevens tackling the way tribal warfare, insidiously encouraged by the imperialists, created the market forces for slavery \u2013 although Ghezo is now considering making the big business-model move from slavery to palm oil, which is lucrative and plentiful. This is a big, bold picture with the vivid presences of Davis, Lynch, Atim and Mbedu giving it some real voltage. I sometimes wondered if there wasn\u2019t room for a more potent villain here, someone worthy to face off dramatically with the charismatic Davis: Boyega\u2019s Ghezo is supposed to be flawed but there was perhaps room for a real antagonist to strike more sparks. Even so, this is a grand spectacle with vivid and theatrical performances. The Woman King is released on 4 October in cinemas.","377":"Writer-director Neil LaBute has created some genuinely challenging work for cinema and theatre, including the 90s toxic-masculinity classic In the Company of Men. But he takes his eye off the ball sometimes, and in this film the ball is so far outside LaBute\u2019s eyeline, he might as well be outside the stadium trying to remember where he parked the car.House of Darkness is a tedious quarter-baked straight-to-video revenge horror set-up that is sort of \u2013 but not really \u2013 satirising male attitudes. Justin Long plays Hap, a guy who has just picked up Mina (Kate Bosworth), a young woman in a bar, assuring her that he is \u201cseparated\u201d from his wife. This demure, white-clad young siren asks Hap to drive her home, which turns out to be a weird Castle Dracula mansion in the middle of nowhere. She asks him in to this creepy old-timey place and while she is gone in the kitchen fixing them both drinks, Hap can\u2019t help gloating on the mobile to his friend about how he\u2019s almost certain to score. With a sweet smile, Mina returns with the drinks giving no hint that she heard his ungallant comments. And after what feels like hours and hours and hours of tensely cutesy conversation and directionless non-action, the grisly main event finally kicks off.This feels like something LaBute wrote in an afternoon on the notes app on his smartphone while thinking about something else. It doesn\u2019t even really have a plot or narrative development. Even the introduction of new characters doesn\u2019t advance the action or make things interesting. It\u2019s just set-up \u2013 and punchline. Then credits. This really is just streaming content to be sludged through your laptop or tablet. Long will always have a place in everyone\u2019s heart because of his appearance in Galaxy Quest and Dodgeball, but this doesn\u2019t suit him (or Bosworth) one bit. House of Darkness is released on 10 October on digital platforms.","378":"Documentary film-maker Patricio Guzm\u00e1n returns to his great and tragic theme of exile \u2013 from his Chilean homeland, from his past, from a world that made a certain sort of sense before the brutal 1973 coup which unseated Salvador Allende and introduced a military despotism whose ugly consequences have never been resolved there. Like his 2012 film Nostalgia for the Light, which reflected on the vast beauty of the Atacama desert in central Chile and thegreat Paranal observatory, contrasted with the shabby dishonour of 73, The Cordillera of Dreams again finds the film-maker juxtaposing the historical chaos and despair with the eternal beauty and mystery of the landscape: in this case, the awe-inspiring \u201ccordillera\u201d or Andean mountain range that surrounds his home town of Santiago.Guzm\u00e1n fled Chile soon after the coup and the cordillera\u2019s vastness haunts his dreams and those of the many Chileans he interviews: artists, writers, scientists. Is its colossal unchangingness reassuring, or disturbing? Does it make Chileans\u2019 human pain and injustice look irrelevant? Just as Paul Robeson\u2019s Ol\u2019 Man River just keeps on rolling along in the midst of racism and slavery, the cordillera just stands there in geological time, for hundreds of thousands of years, indifferent to the minuscule reversals of human history.Yet Guzm\u00e1n finds in the cordillera something inspiring and energising: a thread of beauty and romance which energises him. He speaks to people in Chile who have kept the faith, including film-maker Pablo Salas, whose filming over 40 years has accumulated a vital archive of the people\u2019s resistance to oppression, inhumanity and mediocrity. Guzm\u00e1n is reticent on the subject of US involvement in the coup; I\u2019d like to see him confront Henry Kissinger. This is rich and valuable testament to Chilean courage. The Cordillera of Dreams is released on 7 October in cinemas.","379":"\u2018You must kill Kate Bush!\u201d The order is given on a planet far, far away. And so begins the odyssey at the centre of this trippy, erotic sci-fi fantasy, a film that looks like a horny music video from the 80s, neon-lit and smothered with glitter, the screen filled with erect nipples in quantities not seen since the early seasons of Game of Thrones. It\u2019s French, of course, directed by underground film-maker Bertrand Mandico with such loopy abandon I could almost forgive him the film\u2019s obscenely indulgent two-hour-plus running time.Kate Bush is not the Kate Bush. Her full name is Katarzyna Buszowska (Agata Buzek), and she\u2019s a Polish outlaw on a post-Earth colony in space populated by women. (The men all died soon after arrival.) Kate Bush has one hairy arm (as furry as a werewolf\u2019s), black pointy fingernails and a third eye in her, erm, vagina. She\u2019s also possessed of an otherworldly beauty: imagine David Bowie, Tilda Swinton and Patti Smith fed through one of those facial morphing apps.The story makes about as much sense as you would expect. Kate Bush seduces a stroppy teenager, Roxy (Paula Luna), into saving her from execution. As punishment, Roxy is banished with her mother (Elina L\u00f6wensohn), and ordered to hunt down Kate Bush. But forget about the plot, which is a mere backdrop to the psychedelic planetary wildness Mandico has dreamed up. I could fill pages with the deranged details: the hairy caterpillar cigarettes that wriggle as Roxy smokes them; the male android that instead of a penis has tentacles like long flaccid fingers; a hot tub filled with erotic goop.After Blue is a preposterous film, easy to ridicule. But it\u2019s surely already halfway to cult classic status \u2013 destined to play midnight slots, watched by students smuggling bottles of red wine into the cinema under their coats. After Blue (Dirty Paradise) is released on 7 October in cinemas and on digital platforms.","380":"The great Australian protest documentary Ningla-A\u2019na is returning to cinemas with a new restoration timed for the 50th anniversary of the film and its subject. Capturing the early days of the Aboriginal Tent Embassy \u2013 a hugely influential symbol of sovereignty that began as a beach umbrella erected by four activists (Billy Craigie, Tony Coorey, Michael Anderson and Bert Williams) in 1972 \u2013 it\u2019s not just a historical document but a kind of evergreen clarion call and electric time capsule, burning with white-hot energy and a searing sense of purpose all these years later.The launch of the Tent Embassy marked the first time many saw First Nations people confronting the establishment. In Ningla-A\u2019na we watch protestors congregate, march, occupy public spaces and clash with cops, including in one shocking sequence that became a widely seen and highly influential depiction of police brutality. This moment, as curator Liz McNiven wrote for the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia website, \u201cbrought international attention to Aboriginal people\u2019s struggle for land rights and human rights\u201d and even \u201cfundamentally changed the way the world saw Australia\u201d.Italian-born director Alessandro Cavadini structures the film \u2013 which was clearly made from inside the movement \u2013 around Indigenous voices. Given its message that black activists don\u2019t need white spokespeople, it was an odd choice to open with an elderly white pacifist and former veteran, Jim Leacock, who comments about his life and attitudes towards war before finally moving on to the topic at hand, describing the push for Aboriginal land rights as \u201cthe most important direction we can take in helping to restore some of the injustice\u201d.But then Cavadini takes to the streets and never looks back, capturing many engaging subjects and the intense feeling and fervour of what would become a watershed moment in Australian history. The coolest subject is probably the great Gumbaynggirr activist and artist Gary Foley, who is what they call in documentary land \u201cgreat talent\u201d \u2013 a pull-no-punches presence who is loquacious, charismatic and mad as hell. After a tetchy exchange with a well-dressed white woman, Foley discusses the need for the black community to represent themselves, criticising previous iterations of the movement for being \u201cfull of white liberal shits\u201d and arguing \u201cpeople like her fucked our movement up for 20 years\u201d.Foley then responds to the suggestion that the movement may find more support from the wider community if he tones down his use of language. His retort is one for the ages. On the notion of obscenity: \u201cYou think that my language is obscene \u2026 I think that what is going on in the black communities in this country is obscene.\u201d And on being offensive: \u201cI find very, very, very offensive the fact that a black person in birth, if he sets one foot in a bloody thoroughfare, he will get his head kicked in \u2026 I find very offensive the highest infant mortality rate in the world in this country amongst black kids \u2026. that\u2019s offensive to me.\u201dNingla-A\u2019na\u2019s restoration took seven months to complete, cost around $40,000 and received crowdfunding support from financiers including Russell Crowe. The rerelease will hopefully introduce it to a new generation and bestow upon the film its rightful status as Australia\u2019s greatest ever protest movie: so alive and so galvanising it seems to have its own electromagnetic force.There\u2019s been some good protest documentaries in recent years (including The Tall Man, Defiant Lives, Brazen Hussies and Frackman) but nothing that registers with this sort of impact. And nothing that so vividly captures such a significant event in modern Australian history, when activists (among many other things) created, as Jennetta Quinn-Bates put it, \u201ca deliberate reminder of the ongoing atrocities subjected to the oldest living culture on the planet\u201d and a space where Indigenous people \u2013 in the words of Roxley Foley \u2013 can \u201cheal something in themselves\u201d.Cavadini takes a multifaceted approach to exploring activism, digressing from tumultuous footage to quieter moments exploring topics such as the role of feminism within the movement, the birth of modern Indigenous theatre, and the shocking state of Indigenous health, articulated in a powerful sequence by Professor Fred Hollows. Cavadini went on to co-direct another historically significant documentary, Two Laws, which introduced many white Australians to the concept of this country having two kinds of laws, one of course existing far longer than the other.With time maybe that production will also be restored and its presence renewed in the zeitgeist. For now all eyes should be on Ningla-A\u2019na: the very definition of an unmissable Australian film, returning to the big screen like a clap of thunder.Ningla-A\u2019na is playing in select theatres around Australia","381":"The last time we saw Lesley Manville in a fashion movie, she was playing the highly strung sister and business partner of Daniel Day-Lewis\u2019s fastidious British couturier in Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s Phantom Thread. Now she returns in a very different fashion film set in very much the same era: the musty old 1950s, playing a chirpy London cleaning lady called Mrs Harris whose backdated war-widow pension kicks in at the same time as a win on the football pools (younger viewers may need to Google that), and she heads off to Paris with a big dream: to buy a beautiful Christian Dior gown.Wide-eyed Mrs Harris finds herself initially looked down on with haughty Gallic astonishment by the fashion house\u2019s formidable director of operations Mme Colbert (Isabelle Huppert), who has no great wish to be addressed as \u201cducks\u201d. But Mrs Harris\u2019s innate charm and innocence wins everyone over. It is adapted from the 1958 novel by Paul Gallico in which she was \u201cMrs \u2019Arris\u201d in its original American title: a condescension that this film corrects.There\u2019s such a lovely sweet-natured sense of fun in this Cinderella tale, a multicoloured confection like something that Fortnum & Mason might put in the shop window. Manville carries it off with absolute conviction: she plays Mrs Harris\u2019s naivety with just the right lightness, her determination with the right edge of steel, and her inner grief at the long-denied loss of her husband with the right seriousness and sadness.And there\u2019s a terrific supporting cast giving it some zing both sides of the Channel. Anna Chancellor is hilariously awful as the mean Lady Dant, who has enough money to buy a staggering Dior dress (it is the sight of this garment that triggers Mrs Harris\u2019s frock-yearning) but is too stingy to pay her cleaning lady what she owes. Ellen Thomas gives a lovely performance as Mrs Harris\u2019s best mate Violet and Jason Isaacs comes close to pinching the whole thing as the rackety, cheery Archie, who is involved in greyhound racing. Once Mrs Harris makes it to Paris, she encounters the scary Mme Colbert (great tongue-in-cheek stuff from Huppert) but also the handsome, soign\u00e9 Marquis de Chassange, played by Lambert Wilson, who appears to take a gallant shine to Mrs Harris, causing her to be all aflutter.Preposterous though it may be, this is a terrific family movie in a style audiences may not have seen since Mary Poppins. I hope it\u2019s a box-office smash up to Christmas and beyond. Mrs Harris Goes to Paris is released on 30 September in UK cinemas and 27 October in Australia.","382":"There\u2019s usually a no more heart-sinking way of starting a movie than with the larky, slippery announcement: \u201cBased on a true story \u2013 mostly!\u201d or \u201cWhat follows is all accurate \u2013 kinda!\u201d It usually means the film will fall between the two stools marked \u201ccreatively interesting\u201d and \u201cfactually informative\u201d. However, David O Russell begins his elaborate screwball mystery Amsterdam by declaring: \u201cA lot of this actually happened.\u201d He means the film is a wacky riff on the little-known 1933 \u201cWhite House putsch\u201d in which a cabal of wealthy American businessmen conspired to overthrow President Franklin D Roosevelt, hoping to dupe a retired major general called Smedley Butler into leading their fascist veterans\u2019 organisation. (Maybe the nearest British equivalent was Lord Mountbatten being approached in 1968 by a group of establishment grandees to unseat Labour prime minister Harold Wilson.)Amsterdam imagines three innocent veterans being drawn into these creepy shenanigans. Christian Bale plays Burt Berendsen, a disabled ex-soldier who lost an eye in the first world war; after The Big Short, this is Bale\u2019s second \u201cglass eye\u201d role. Burt is a doctor in New York, supplying pain medication and prosthetic limbs to fellow veterans on a pro bono basis. Burt\u2019s army pal Harold Woodman (John David Washington) is now a qualified lawyer, and helping him to run a morale-boosting ex-servicemen\u2019s gala dinner. And the two men\u2019s soulmate is the mercurial and brilliant Valerie Voze, played by Margot Robbie, who in the first world war was a volunteer nurse and dadaist artist who saved all the shrapnel she dug out of soldiers\u2019 shattered bodies to create bizarre objet trouv\u00e9 artworks.Valerie took Burt and Harold for a glorious bohemian retreat in Amsterdam where they did nothing but carouse, but then she mysteriously vanished. And now back in New York in 1933, Burt and Harold witness the bizarre death of a prominent US general\u2019s daughter, and find themselves in the frame for murder; they need the help of another top soldier, General Gil Dillenbeck (Robert De Niro), and Valerie dramatically reappears.There are some great supporting turns here, which periodically break the surface of this film\u2019s soupy strangeness. Rami Malek is very funny as Valerie\u2019s wealthy, silken-voiced brother Tom, always charming and insinuating. Mike Myers is amusing as MI6 operative Paul Canterbury, who for no good reason in one scene does Wilson, Keppel and Betty\u2019s \u201csand dance\u201d, surely the first time this has been seen in the cinema since the opening scene to Julien Temple\u2019s Absolute Beginners. Andrea Riseborough is elegant and stylish as Burt\u2019s snobbish wife Beatrice, and Matthias Schoenaerts and Alessandro Nivola get laughs as two lumpen cops.As for the leads, the best is John David Washington, who pursues a policy alien to his costars: less is more. His performance is cool, unruffled and his address to the camera is very seductively underplayed. Bale and Robbie are doing bigger and broader comedy, and often there isn\u2019t quite the material in the script to back it up \u2013 although Bale has a good bit when Burt takes a new, state-of-the-art morphine painkiller via eyedrops, starts talking about how unreliable these things are and then suddenly interrupts himself: \u201cOh that\u2019s fast!\u201dBut there is something weirdly heavy and foggy in Amsterdam that feels like it\u2019s working against the lightness and nimbleness needed for a caper. It\u2019s the reality of the history, which the movie makes explicit in the closing credits: the grim fact of the US\u2019s proto-fascism understandably means that the comedy isn\u2019t going to be too lighthearted, although the obscurity of this story means that isn\u2019t immediately clear. Well, there are some very good performances, and Washington has taken another step towards A-lister greatness. Amsterdam is released on 7 October in the US and UK.","383":"If you\u2019ve ever had this word addressed to you as an instruction, followed up with \u201c\u2026 it may never happen!\u201d you already know how grotesquely unnatural smiling is if you don\u2019t feel like it. It\u2019s much more difficult than pouting when you\u2019re happy, a skull-grimace of misery, betraying the heartbreak within. Incidentally, I lost a bet with myself as to which Nat King Cole song would be ironically played over this film\u2019s closing credits.Smile is a queasy, nasty horror-melodrama from first time feature director Parker Finn. Like David Robert Mitchell\u2019s 2014 film It Follows, this takes an indirect inspiration from the MR James short story Casting the Runes, all about an unending DNA-replication of evil. It\u2019s shot in a dull, blank, subdued light into which hallucinations and supernatural incursions can insinuate themselves without warning, together with unsubtly brutal but effective jump scares.Sosie Bacon (daughter of Kevin) plays Dr Rose Cotter, a consultant psychiatrist who has chosen to work in the most challenging environment possible: a hospital ER in which patients are invariably at their most violent and troubled. This is Rose\u2019s vocation, stemming from a trauma in her own childhood, which she has effectively suppressed with elaborate professional calm. She is now engaged to a handsome young guy called Trevor (Jessie T Usher), having somewhat heartlessly broken off a relationship with Joel (Kyle Gallner), a cop who through a strange quirk of fate is called to attend when Rose faces the most terrifying case of her life. A deeply disturbed young woman is brought in, wretched with fear and lack of sleep, telling Rose about a hideously smiling demon that stalks her, inhabiting the bodies of various people: some are friends, some are random strangers. And then with a grisly self-destructive flourish, the awful smile itself breaks cover, and Rose realises that it is coming to get her too, and she faces a terrible choice if she wants to escape its curse.Smile is a movie whose influences are certainly detectable: we are, admittedly, close to Scary Movie territory, when we get closeups of the home-security-system keypad on the wall of Rose\u2019s luxurious home, or scenes with her adorable pet, or horrible situations which turn out to be dreams from which the heroine awakens with an explosive gasp. But there is also something arresting about the central, nauseous motif. You see someone taking their own life and are from then on pursued by this grotesque, horrible smile. People who have witnessed something so intimately despairing and horrible have become somehow implicated without their consent in the most violent dysfunction and may indeed spend the rest of their lives toughing it out, smiling through their repressed pain. Yet this buried agony may well manifest itself in carrying on the chain letter of evil: being violent or self-harming with someone else.The movie is a shard of comic and cosmic spite, and the image of the malign smile carries force. Apart from MR James, I found myself thinking of the Kafkaesque short story that Billy Wilder wrote while working as a journalist in Berlin in the 1920s called Wanted: Perfect Optimist, about a man who gets a job in which all he has to do is sit in the office and smile continuously for eight hours a day; it soon becomes an existential ordeal of horror. As for this film, I found myself sheepishly grinning for some time afterwards. Smile is released on 28 September in the UK, 29 September in Australia and 30 September in the US.

In the rock musical Cages, which mixes live performance with holograms, film and animation, it is also the name of a grey dystopian city where the aesthetic is very Tim-Burton-meets-German-expressionism and any display of emotion is forbidden. Hiding in the shadows is the composer Woolf, who sees in Madeline, his pixie-ish muse, the prospect of true love. Can music help them overcome their obstacles?The most significant one facing Cages is the very technology that acts as its selling-point. Advance word suggests that state-of-the-art holograms \u2013 an improvement on the days when Laurence Olivier\u2019s floating head was projected on to the stage of the Dominion theatre for Time \u2013 will be indistinguishable from live actors. But the disparity whenever Woolf (played in the flesh by CJ Baran) interacts with Madeline (Allison Harvard in virtual form) is all too obvious. No wonder the love story feels bloodless when it depends on hitting marks and matching sight-lines, rather than old-fashioned chemistry and rapport. It doesn\u2019t help that the characters communicate via silent-movie intertitles, with a narrator (Harwood Gordon, another hologram) doing all the talking.Filmed crowd scenes showing ranks of secret police with metallic traffic cones on their heads (why?) only emphasise the meagreness of the in-person cast of eight. Baran, who co-created Cages with Benjamin K Romans, is a songwriter rather than an actor, and it shows \u2014 he has none of the physical expressiveness that could have made Woolf more than a plodding silhouette. The evening\u2019s loveliest effect has virtual raindrops sploshing on a real umbrella.The score, also by Baran and Romans, is often reminiscent of 808s & Heartbreak-era Kanye West: lots of doomy synths, vocoder and introspection. Madeline\u2019s refrain, Somebody\u2019s Somebody, is a pale echo of Vanessa Williams\u2019s Save the Best for Last, while a singing moon with a human face prompts memories of The Mighty Boosh. The one bona fide pop anthem (A Love Song) arrives too late to save a prog-heavy second act during which audiences will know exactly how it feels to have anhedonia. At Riverside Studios, London, until 1 January.","385":"The great Taken-ing of actors over 55, from playing dad to playing dad who is also a retired hitman, was a boon for the Neesons and Odenkirks and Costners but less so for their female counterparts, shuffled on from mom to mom who is also married to a retired hitman. Things seem to be slightly improving this year with more women of a similar age allowed into the action genre that has traditionally left them unarmed, with Michelle Yeoh and Viola Davis fighting their way to box office success (before Jamie Lee Curtis returns to \u201cend\u201d Michael Myers next month), and now, inevitably, Netflix is bringing up the rear with a more conventional vehicle, this time for Oscar winner Allison Janney.If only it wasn\u2019t called Lou, a dreadfully silly title that\u2019s hard to say out loud with any vague sense of excitement (just try it \u2013 Lou, Lou, Lou). It\u2019s sadly also hard to watch it while feeling any vague sense of excitement or any sense of anything, really, a film that works best as a thrilling concept \u2013 Allison Janney does Taken \u2013 than a real thing.Janney plays, you got this, Lou, a gruff, self-sufficient loner living, or existing, in the woods, haunted by something or someone, an intentionally simple life until one night things get complicated during a particularly dramatic storm. The daughter of her closest neighbour, Hannah (Jurnee Smollett), has been, we got this, taken, and she needs Lou\u2019s help to find her.Who is Lou? What is Lou? But most important, why is Lou? I haven\u2019t a clue after an intermittently diverting but mostly unremarkable 107 minutes, a film unworthy of both Janney\u2019s talents and our attention. Lou briefly teases that it\u2019s really about something before yanking the veil from our eyes, holding up its hands and shrugging. The film had been originally set up at Paramount with JJ Abrams producing, a not-unimpressive origin tale given most of the guff that gets churned out over at Netflix, but why this script garnered such attention is perhaps the film\u2019s greatest mystery.Described initially as Thelma & Louise meets Taken, Lou is a bit more like Sleeping with the Enemy meets Rambo meets Taken but sadly nowhere near as much fun as that might make it sound. The missing kid has been nabbed by an abusive ex, played with soapy menace that quickly froths out to nothing by Logan Marshall-Green, and the initial storm-set tracking scenes, forcing the women to club together, are efficiently engaging. Director Anna Foerster, whose TV credits include genre fare like Outlander and Westworld, knows how to stage action and set a mood (base level competency still counts for a lot in the streaming netherworld), and when Maggie Cohn and Jack Stanley\u2019s script keeps things simple, there\u2019s some equally simple fun to be had. Janney is, as ever, a true pro, and her wearied cynicism, most often used for comedic effect, makes her a believably haunted antihero, and Lou allows some quieter, weightier moments that her other work doesn\u2019t always afford her.But there\u2019s a dull, derailing twist that complicates and confuses, turning what could have been a tight little chase movie into something far baggier and far harder to get involved in. It edges the film into limp melodrama and takes us further away from the action, a misguided attempt to swap adrenaline with emotion. Janney sells it regardless, but by the end she\u2019s literally and figuratively walking wounded. The sheer existence of Lou might be a step in the right direction for women over 50 in action movies, but it\u2019s a misstep everywhere else.Lou is now available on Netflix","386":"Tyler Perry did not become a billionaire media mogul by making fine art. He did it by mass-producing plays, films and TV series about scorned Black women and their dysfunctional families who ultimately find succor in Christian lessons in forgiveness, dignity and self-worth. And as mesmerizing as it\u2019s been to watch this New Orleans-born, former temp worker who never finished high school write, produce, direct and act in much of this work \u2013 not least as the tart-tongued, pistol wielding granny Madea \u2013 the work ethic didn\u2019t exactly endear him to highbrow consumers who expected more of a 53-year-old Black man who rightly crows about opening one of the industry\u2019s largest studio lots on a former Confederate army base that\u2019s played host to everything from Marvel epics to Bad Boys for Life to Coming to America 2.Spike Lee would set the critical tone against Perry a decade ago, blasting his work as \u201ccoonery\u201d and \u201cbuffoonery\u201d. But when Perry, who got the last laugh by naming a sound stage after the She\u2019s Gotta Have It director, took risks, the audiences for films like For Colored Girls weren\u2019t nearly as robust as they were for the Madea franchise. \u201cI would love to go do a movie that\u2019s as powerful as Schindler\u2019s List,\u201d he told an audience at a Goldman Sachs conference four years ago. \u201cI wrote a script in 1995 about a Holocaust survivor and a jazz singer. But I knew what I was building I had to focus on \u2026 so that I could build all these other things to stand on.\u201dHere at last is that feature, A Jazzman\u2019s Blues, which couldn\u2019t be more unrecognizable as a Tyler Perry production. Gone are the overbearing religious themes, the risible wigs and the familiar rotation of company players burning through tens of pages of a day in single takes. (Brad Benedict, a supporting actor in the BET White House drama The Oval, was one notable exception.) Rather, this is a story that takes its time building characters and conflict over the course of two-plus hours before winding down with a wallop. If there\u2019s anything to lament, it\u2019s Perry\u2019s decision to drop the film on Netflix instead of challenging the current box office\u2019s weak crop. Jazzman isn\u2019t just good for a Tyler Perry movie. It\u2019s good full stop.Set in rural Georgia in 1940, Jazzman starts as a teen romance between family black sheep Bayou (Joshua Boone) and Leanne (Solea Pfeiffer), who is sent away to live up north after Bayou proposes marriage. Even though he goes on with his life (enlists in the service, dodges combat and returns home after suffering an injury), he still carries a flame for Leanne. And when she returns on the arm of a white scion of a political dynasty, it sends shivers through the Black community who knew her back when. Bayou knows she\u2019s \u201cplaying a dangerous game\u201d, but neither can resist the urge to reconnect. When Leanne\u2019s diabolical mother, who sent her away to begin with, catches wind of the kids\u2019 rekindled romance, she tells a lie that forces Bayou to skip town with his older brother for Chicago.That brother, Wille Earl (Austin Scott), was off to make his fortune as a trumpet player and had an audition (kind of) set up in the hottest room in town by his mysterious manager Ira (Ryan Eggold), a Holocaust survivor with acute survivor\u2019s guilt. But as Bayou, a shy singer with a big voice, emerges as the much bigger talent, Wille Earl\u2019s resentment deepens with his addiction to heroin. Like Leanne, Bayou is eventually lured back home to check in on his mother, whose thriving juke joint business grew fallow after he escaped town. The star-crossed lovers hitch another plan to ditch town again, this time with a baby in their party.Everything about this film is genuinely absorbing. The performances are restrained. The locations, many of them seemingly on the Perry Studios lot, are lush. The musical numbers are decadent, no doubt thanks to Perry roping in the multi-Grammy winning jazz composer Terence Blanchard, a longtime Spike Lee collaborator. The storytelling is efficient, the scenes well-paced, the command of social and racial politics ironclad. Perry never shows up on screen, in drag or otherwise. But his vast talent and resources shine through. And so does his heart.So Perry took 30 years to build an empire. In the end, there\u2019s no doubt it was the right move. If he had tried starting his career with Jazzman, the world probably never sees the film at all, let alone in this stunning, unadulterated form. Perry not only fulfilled his promise \u2013 you could call this his magnum opus. But (and I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m writing this) his best might indeed be yet to come.A Jazzman\u2019s Blues is now available on Netflix","387":"Director R Balki must have got a kick out of writing this very enjoyable poison-pen letter to film criticism in which a Mumbai serial killer stalks the practitioners of our noble profession. Se7en-style, the killer tailors the murders to the critique; woe betide the hack who thoughtlessly writes: \u201cA picture whose heart is in the right place, but whose other organs are all over the place.\u201d Not only is this premise a droll kick up the arse for the Scream-style meta-slasher, it has to be the first film in which someone says \u201cI need a critic\u201d in the same imperative tone usually reserved for a Swat team or an elite hitman.First for cancellation is the career-assassin journalist found seated on his toilet, scored around his torso with bloody grooves. Police chief Mathur (Sunny Deol) twigs that the triangle carved into his forehead is, in fact, an uncompleted star, and that the killer, the \u201ccritics\u2019 critic\u201d, is \u201crating\u201d his victims. Meanwhile, Nila (Shreyer Dhanwanthary) is the new entertainment reporter on the Mumbai Post. A film fanatic who likes to live within earshot of the musical numbers emanating from her local studio, she seems to be falling into her own movie romance when she meets strapping florist Danny (Dulquer Salmaan). So far, so masala \u2013 apart for the fact that, in private, Danny holds Norman Bates-style conversations with himself.Balki, whose last film was the 2018 sanitary-towel comedy Pad Man, has a knack for a topical hook. Chup successfully skewers not just the tense film-maker\/critic relationship, but knows perfectly where to put its finger to best needle Film Twitter: it calls out hot-take merchants, overly positive and corrupt reviewers, and this exalted calling\u2019s self-importance. \u201cI cannot live like this any more \u2013 like a terrorist attack,\u201d says the wife of one critic under police protection. Balki even manages to make Chup\u2019s disparate sides \u2013 the satirical police procedure and dulcet romance \u2013 work productively in tandem. The latter increasingly puts a bloody, ironic spin on Bollywood fantasy, as Danny turns out to be a fanboy of the lamented Guru Dutt, the celebrated writer-director who may have killed himself in 1964 at the age of 39 in the wake of the bad reception to his final film, Kaagaz Ke Phool.But as Amitabh Bachchan, cameoing, says: \u201cCinema needs fearless voices for its evolution\u201d; someone has to tell Chup where it doesn\u2019t quite click. Salmaan \u2013 though generally effective in his eerie affableness \u2013 clubs us over the head with the split personality stuff. The sound designer who came up with the bizarre mobile phone trill that accompanies significant plot points should be shot. And at well over two hours, the film stretches the plausibility of both his premise and the performances on the rack at the finish. Perhaps I should be more careful how I phrase things, but it\u2019s a caustic and tasty film for the most part. Chup: Revenge of the Artist is released in cinemas on 23 September","388":"The Scandinavian show home breeds monsters in Hanna Bergholm\u2019s pitch-black Jungian fairytale, pungently set in a sunny Finnish suburb of towering pine trees and pristine picture windows. Siiri Solalinna plays Tinja, the henpecked daughter of a ghastly influencer mum, anxiously rehearsing her moves before a gymnastics trial. But Solalinna is also Alli, Tinja\u2019s feral alter ego, who sleeps under the bed, emerging at intervals to terrorise the neighbourhood, variously biting down on local pets and rival gymnasts. Alli, of course, is a manifestation of adolescent rage. The film\u2019s a bloodstained thesis on the divided self.So what if the psychological subtext is shoved to the fore and shouted loud? Hatching delivers as a straightforward horror as well, in that it\u2019s deliciously repulsive behind the antiseptic facade. Bergholm gives us precision-tooled jump scares and creeping, clammy atmospherics; a malevolent mother and an insurrectionist child. Every unhappy family, Tolstoy said, is unhappy in its own way. This one, for instance, contains crazed crows and dead dogs.","389":"The sweet stench of failure hangs like a cloud over Owen (son of Kevin) Kline\u2019s excellent feature debut; a film so malodorous and barely house-trained that one is half-tempted to prop it outside by the bins. I liked this a lot. Funny Pages spins a hilarious tale from the fringes of the underground comics scene, powered by a wonderfully sour performance by Daniel Zolghadri as Robert, a teenage cartoonist who strikes out on his own.Working as a clerk inside a tatty district attorney\u2019s office, Robert is stunned to discover that one of the deadbeat clients is none other than Wallace Schearer (Matthew Maher), the assistant colourist on some of his favourite old editions. In Robert\u2019s eyes, Wallace is an unsung hero, a comic-book Picasso who has fallen on hard times. To everyone else he\u2019s a walking disaster, the sort of wayward, cantankerous misanthrope who should on no account be invited to the family home for Christmas dinner.And yet Wallace, it\u2019s alarming to note, is merely the principal weirdo in a rogues\u2019 gallery of losers that runs the gamut from Robert\u2019s twitchy best friend to the residents of a basement flophouse downtown. Each is fuelled by uncompromising nerd fury; each bent out of shape by their devotion to pop culture. These dreamers and schemers aren\u2019t bad people, exactly. Like Jessica Rabbit, they\u2019re just drawn that way.In cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema","390":"In a poetic piece made for the BBC in 1998 about the work of British artist Richard Devereux, David Bowie confronted \u201ca deep and formidable mystery: I\u2019m dying. You\u2019re dying. Second by second, all is transient. Does it matter?\u201d Those words circle around Moonage Daydream, threading in and out of Brett Morgen\u2019s unfolding screen elegy. They bookend Morgen\u2019s maximalist collage of Bowie\u2019s life, work and thoughts \u2013 from disposable glam-pop culture to timeless matters of life and death via a kaleidoscopic montage of music, mime, painting, acting, animation and dance, all filtered through a cosmic wardrobe of ever-changing clothes, hair and teeth.\u201cHe\u2019s smashing!\u201d burbles a 1970s Ziggy fan, one of many who have waited tearfully at a stage door to catch a glimpse of their idol. On stage, Bowie performs All the Young Dudes and Wild Eyed Boy From Freecloud while cameras peer lasciviously up his silk-printed, polo-necked minidress. \u201cEverything is rubbish, and all rubbish is wonderful,\u201d says Bowie, another of the endlessly quotable found fragments that are the closest the film comes to narration. A little later, we hear of his \u201chotch-potch philosophy \u2013 I was a Buddhist on Tuesday and I was into Nietzsche by Friday\u201d.There\u2019s more than a touch of Julien Temple\u2019s pop-culture car-crash aesthetic in the way Morgen, whose credits include the 2002 Robert Evans documentary The Kid Stays in the Picture and 2015\u2019s  Cobain: Montage of Heck, uses fragments of films (Un Chien Andalou, The Wizard of Oz, 2001: A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange \u2013 all of which Bowie eagerly recycled in his songs and stage shows) to illustrate this multifaceted tale. Scenes from The Man Who Fell to Earth are juxtaposed almost indistinguishably with Cracked Actor, the documentary that first made Nicolas Roeg think he\u2019d found his starman. Meanwhile, the studied awkwardness of early interviews stands in striking contrast to Bowie\u2019s confidence on stage, confirming his claim that he felt most comfortable playing other people. Only later in life does he appear to find peace with himself.There is some fragmentary childhood backstory, including memories of his half-brother, Terry, who introduced him to Jack Kerouac and John Coltrane before succumbing to schizophrenia. But it\u2019s the lives Bowie created, rather than the one he inherited, that are Morgen\u2019s main focus. Thus we see him scissoring journals in an attempt to apply William Burroughs\u2019s cut-up techniques to songwriting, and hear of his desire to strip away the past and discover new ways of recording with Brian Eno on the Berlin trilogy.While the overall progression of the film is broadly chronological, individual elements are shuffled for thematic effect. The intercutting of Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll Suicide with an account of Bowie\u2019s most commercially successful period in the 80s (all marionette boxercise moves and Gloria Hunniford-style blond bouffants) drives home the point that, beneath the hits and sellout tours, this was \u201cthe vacuum of my life\u2026 I never wanted to be out there pleasing people\u201d. More subtly, the keyboard stems from Cygnet Committee provide perfect accompaniment to images of the artworks Bowie once chose to keep private, while the drumbeats of Sound and Vision and the vocals of Absolute Beginners collide in \u201cmusical mashups\u201d smartly designed and edited by Morgen, overseen by Tony Visconti.Is it definitive? Of course not. No two-and-a-quarter hour film could ever hope to contain Bowie\u2019s labyrinthine legacy, and despite the exhaustive mining of rich archival material (some familiar, some revelatory), there are still plenty of roads for future film-makers to follow. What Moonage Daydream does manage to do is to share some of the adventurous spirit of its subject \u2013 a chameleon who wasn\u2019t afraid of falling flat on his face while reaching for the stars. If Bowie\u2019s career teaches us anything, it\u2019s that no one can laugh at you if you\u2019ve already laughed at yourself. Certainly his capacity for balancing seriousness with self-deprecation (\u201cNo shit, Sherlock!\u201d) remained one of Bowie\u2019s most endearing traits.Earlier this year, film director Duncan Jones (Moon, Source Code, Mute) tweeted that, although he had not yet seen this new film about his father\u2019s life, \u201cit absolutely has the blessing of our family\u201d because \u201cI know it was made with love\u201d. It sounds cheesy to say so, but it is precisely that profound sense of love that shines through Moonage Daydream.","391":"One person\u2019s paradise is another\u2019s circle of hell, particularly if that person has an aversion to rich American tourists and movies that resemble glossy corporate videos. Such, sadly, is the case with Ol Parker\u2019s Ticket to Paradise, which sends Julia Roberts and George Clooney to Bali where it proceeds to pose them beside the swimming pools and flower beds of a luxury island resort. One assumes that everybody involved had a fabulous time; the production amounts to a lavish paid vacation. How the rest of us benefit is anyone\u2019s guess.Naturally the film is at pains to conceal its hand, merrily insisting that the protagonists are actually in Bali under duress and would really rather be doing anything other than guzzling cocktails and cavorting with dolphins. That\u2019s because Clooney and Roberts play bickering divorcees, ostensibly on a mission to sabotage their daughter\u2019s betrothal to a local seaweed farmer. But they\u2019re kidding nobody, perhaps not even themselves, since the script makes it clear that these two are secretly still in love and that the upcoming wedding is not the real romance here. The course of true love rarely did run smooth \u2013 except in this instance, when it could be travelling on greased rails.Hold your nose and squint your eyes and you have an inkling of what Ticket to Paradise dearly wants to be: an old-school Hollywood screwball in the vein of The Awful Truth or My Favourite Wife. Maybe Cary Grant and Irene Dunne could have made this fly, although even they may have required more grit, more rigour and a director less easily seduced by every white sandy beach and golden sunset that he sees. Clooney and Roberts try their best but they\u2019re finally not much more than decoration themselves, the filmic equivalent of plastic figurines on a cake.In cinemas on 20 September","392":"With help from a Kickstarter campaign, film-maker and rugby coach Matt Carter has made a poignant lo-fi drama about a gay London rugby team. It\u2019s a film with some terrific real-feeling characters, the kind who speak in the way actual people do \u2013 they\u2019d be binge-worthily watchable in a series on TV or a streaming platform, flawed and lovely. Here, a bit unfortunately, they\u2019re relegated to the sidelines \u2013 B team to a romance between the film\u2019s two least interesting characters.One of those two is Mark, played by obscenely good-looking former Emmerdale actor Alexander Lincoln. Mark is in an open relationship with his rich, arty-looking boyfriend, sharing a penthouse overlooking the Thames. They\u2019re living the dream, but seem stagnant emotionally as a couple. Mark has recently joined gay rugby club, the South London Stags where he claps eyes on Warren (Alexander King), who is in a monogamous relationship with another teammate. In five minutes flat, Mark and Warren are slammed up against the wall of a toilet cubicle.It\u2019s an annoyingly long film \u2013 well over two hours \u2013 and a goodish chunk of this time is spent watching Mark and Warren in hot, can\u2019t-keep-their-hands-off-each-other clinches. The script gives us less about their emotional connection and to be honest, the will-they-won\u2019t-they-stay-together drama is a bit of a snore. The best scenes are down the rugby club, portrayed with tremendous warmth as a happy-ish semi-dysfunctional family.I wanted to know more about captain Jimmy, the team\u2019s J\u00fcrgen Klopp, who gives pre-match pep talks with deep emotional intelligence. And club comedian Pinkie (Pearse Egan) who has a lovely speech about hating rugby at school as a gay kid. The absolute grimness \u2013 or glory, if you see it that way \u2013 of grassroots rugby looks horribly authentic too. The cold, the mud, the terror of being charged at by four men who order XXL when buying T-shirts and look like extras in a Viking epic. In from the Side is released on 16 September in cinemas.","393":"Released to coincide with World Cancer Research day, Thomas Meadmore\u2019s tricky yet involving documentary follows two Britons going rogue in search of a better quality of treatment. Grant Branton, from Brighton, is a sometime biologist reeling after early tests spotted tumours in his bowels while missing shadows in his bones; Surinder Paul, landed with breast cancer, hopes to avoid a mastectomy by leaning hard into oils, juicing and cravatted energy healers \u2013 what oncological voice-of-reason Rob Glynne-Jones calls \u201cquackery\u201d. Both have taken their lives into their own hands, which notionally affords them greater control but also obliges them to take critical decisions \u2013 even fashion their own suppositories \u2013 on ever-dwindling energy reserves.It\u2019s tricky because Meadmore largely detaches these subjects from any context beyond the rooms they\u2019re in. (There\u2019s nothing about Branton\u2019s career as a commercials and music video producer, for example.) Emphasis is thereby placed firmly on the individual, but many viewers will want more about Branton and Paul\u2019s precise relationship to the NHS, and \u2013 if they went private \u2013 how and how much they\u2019re paying. (It\u2019s unclear from what is shown, possibly reflecting the blurred lines of modern British healthcare.) As carefully applied voiceover takes pains to establish, these two are outliers: Branton\u2019s Facebook interactions and a troubling encounter with a self-appointed American guru illustrate how close we are to the fringes of anti-science conspiracy theory.Yet both remain compelling figures, eliciting natural sympathy and concern as they eye the enemy within. (No melodramatic \u201cfights\u201d or \u201cbattles\u201d here \u2013 just the humdrum reality of endless tests and meetings to reveal results of tests.) Alpha-adjacent Branton endures horrific coughing fits to reaffirm his love for wife Christine; while Paul has the advantage of a large, loving, supportive family, she\u2019s evidently determined to go her own way. For his part, Meadmore bides ever-more-valuable time, monitoring his subjects\u2019 ebbs and flows, allowing them to make their own choices and us to form our own opinions, before finally ensuring the facts of these poignant case studies speak for themselves. The Cancer Conflict is released on 19 September on digital platforms","394":"This charming if decidedly silly sci-fi love story unfolds in a near future where clothes and home furnishings look much like the stuff we have today \u2013 while some of the tech equipment the props department came up with looks like the prizewinners at a primary school art fair. For example, there\u2019s a headset people can put on as they go to bed, a mass of wires and twinkly fairy lights, which stops invasive advertising (designed to implant the desire for fried chicken or soft drinks) getting into the sleeper\u2019s dreams. Another looks like a cardboard box with dials painted on it.Writer-director team Kentucker Audley and Albert Birney\u2019s low-budget whimsy aesthetic, propelled by a gently satirical undercurrent, is of a piece with other independent film-makers on the smaller film festival beat such as Jocelyn DeBoer and Dawn Luebbe, whose quirky suburban fantasia Greener Grass had a release in the UK in 2019. The whole genre is a very refreshing change from slick, hyperrealistic CGI-led films, especially when, as Audley and Birney do here, film-makers use old-school animation techniques and 100-year-old camera tricks to create their dream worlds.Audley himself plays Preble, a tax inspector with a dashing trilby, who arrives at the pink homestead of an elderly bohemian lady named Bella (Penny Fuller). His job is to audit not just her income but the value of objects in her dreams, which he can access using some of the funky aforementioned tech because everyone\u2019s dreams are recorded. Wandering around Bella\u2019s dreamscapes, Preble falls in love with Bella as a younger woman (played by Grace Glowicki) and is intrigued by people he sees in her dreams that look like they\u2019re covered in living grass like walking front lawns, or trailing fringes of videotape. Eventually, tragedy strikes and Preble goes deeper into the dream record for \u201cyears\u201d \u2013 or just a long stretch of sleep \u2013 where he lives happily with young Bella on an island, inventing games with shells and eating vegetables they find in the sand. It\u2019s like Audley and Birney have done a remake of Christopher Nolan\u2019s Inception with only sticky-back plastic and a couple of wobbly green screens for effects.Beneath the crazy candy-coloured palette, there is actually some real human warmth in the love story, and the acting ensemble features some great comic performers in supporting roles, including Constance Shulman (Yoga Jones in Orange is the New Black) and character actor Linas Phillips (Manson Family Vacation) as a sinister \u201cfriend\u201d who infiltrates many people\u2019s dreams. Strawberry Mansion is released on 16 September in cinemas and on digital platforms.","395":"\u201cBut he doesn\u2019t hurt me though,\u201d Alice insists to her two oldest friends, both staring at her with combined sadness and exhaustion. In the unsettling and unvarnished drama Alice, Darling, Alice\u2019s boyfriend does hurt her but probably not in the ways we often hear about and definitely not in the ways we often see on screen.Films about domestic abuse tend to rely on the aesthetic shock of seeing someone physically hurt their partner, an undeniable gut punch but one that too frequently takes precedent over the more insidious and inescapable ways of exerting control over someone. There was a tough and troubling TV one-off called I Am Nicola in 2019 that saw Vicky McClure trapped in a toxic relationship that was heralded by a domestic violence charity at the time for the importance of showing how someone can be knocked down without a single punch. There\u2019s an equally devastating and necessary grind to Alice, Darling, a buzz-free Toronto film festival premiere that deserves to have everyone talking.Alice is played by Anna Kendrick, an actor who doesn\u2019t always connect with some of her overly cutesy comedic work but is exceptionally, hauntingly effective here, playing a woman frazzled by a particular brand of private anxiety. In the opening scene, she meets her two closest friends for dinner (Wunmi Mosaku and Kaniehtiio Horn), a girls\u2019 night punctuated by the sounds of Alice receiving texts, each causing her eyes to blink a little bit faster or her fingers to tap just that bit louder. She\u2019s in a relationship with handsome artist Simon (Charlie Carrick) and he likes to check in.While Alanna Francis\u2019s intelligent and uncommonly subtle script doesn\u2019t take long to show us that Simon is coercive, it keeps us unsure over just how coercive he might be. We\u2019re shown less of his destructive perfectionism in action and more of the impact it has on Alice \u2013 obsessively manicuring, lecturing about the dangers of sugar, pulling out increasingly large chunks of her hair \u2013 and director Mary Nighy, daughter of Bill, making her debut, chooses to show us only the briefest flashbacks to Simon at his worst, a restraint that proves horribly potent, effect prioritized over cause. Alice\u2019s friends invite her to a cottage out of town for a birthday celebration, just the three of them, and Alice relents, telling Simon she has to go away on a work trip. At the house, her behavior gets harder to tolerate, oscillating between nervy, difficult and confrontational, the anger and frustration that\u2019s been building up with no place to go threatening to explode.It becomes an unintentional intervention as Alice\u2019s relationship is suddenly dragged into conversations outside of the ones she has with herself. The nasty things she\u2019s been conditioned to believe \u2013 that she\u2019s selfish, that she\u2019s unfair, that she should feel shame, that she\u2019s just not good \u2013 combusting once air is allowed in. It\u2019s a tough process and Francis avoids tired therapy tropes both in how she shows the jagged nature of Alice\u2019s journey (steps forward and steps back alternating) and how the women speak to each other, with a bracing, often cruel, frankness that only the oldest of friends are allowed to have. It\u2019s written with such depth of feeling and particularity that only experience can provide. The limited range of abuse narratives \u2013 which often feel filled in with basics learned from watching other abuse narratives \u2013 has led us to expect a type, perhaps withdrawn and lacking in confidence, usually wearing long sleeves to hide the bruises. But Alice is difficult, often incredibly annoying to be around, angry and spiky, forced to over-sexualize the way she looks rather than retreat. It\u2019s a character written with an odd singularity we don\u2019t usually see.Kendrick gives a performance of equal specificity; believably, uncomfortably consumed by the sort of deep-rooted anxiety that makes others feel just as on edge. It\u2019s deeply unpleasant to see her spiral (the grimly over-emphasized sound design of her yanking out longer pieces of hair is truly wrenching) and with the actor recently speaking out about an experience of being with a psychologically abusive boyfriend not long before she signed onto the movie, it feels as if the pain and anger come from a real place. It\u2019s her finest performance to date and while their characters aren\u2019t given that much beyond the basics, Mosaku and Horn are both excellent, their every line and decision made to ring true, an authentic dynamic that leads to an incredibly moving moment of extreme protection in the last act.It\u2019s a chilling little film, avoiding maximalism at every turn, a bold debut from Nighy (whose only real slip-up is a score that can feel dull and uninspired) and a difficult reminder of a difficult experience. The chill will linger for a while.In the US, the domestic violence hotline is 1-800-799-SAFE (7233). In the UK, call the national domestic abuse helpline on 0808 2000 247, or visit Women\u2019s Aid.

Most importantly, it includes a marvellous direct-to-camera raconteur performance from Poitier himself, recorded before he died in January this year. (It also includes some great archive TV material and chat-show clips, including of course appearances on Dick Cavett, without whom no documentary of this sort is possible and who surely deserves a documentary of his own.). Harry Belafonte, his great friend, ally and rival in the civil rights movement, now 95 years old, was evidently not well enough to contribute, but he too is captured in clips.Poitier came of age in the 1960s as a pioneering African-American movie star, in an era when society was loosening up: McCarthyism was on the wane, paranoia was declining, America\u2019s white middle classes were waking up to civil rights and he was to prove a persuasive and charming ambassador for black rights with wonderful presence, dignity and Shakespearian bearing \u2013 although oddly, he never acted in Shakespeare.Poitier grew up in poverty in the Bahamas and has some wonderful anecdotes about his astonishment on visiting Nassau as a child and seeing a car for the first time \u2013 and also seeing a mirror for the first time, goggling at the duplication it created. On moving to Miami, he faced death threats and violence from the Ku Klux Klan, but moved to New York City, got a job as a dishwasher in a caf\u00e9 where a kindly Jewish waiter helped him to learn to read, and he learned his sonorous voice from a white radio announcer.From there, Poitier found work in the American Negro Theatre and got a breakthrough movie role in Blackboard Jungle as a smart high-schooler. He was the black convict chained to Tony Curtis\u2019s white convict in The Defiant Ones as they made their break from a prison van, gradually coming to like the white man and creating a mythic self-sacrifice when he throws himself from a moving train rather than abandon him: a gesture that still divides pundits even now. The slap he gave to a white man in In The Heat of the Night was a sensational moment. Poitier was upset to be later regarded as a safe \u201cUncle Tom\u201d figure, but he kept working in the industry, transitioning to directing with resounding success.The documentary does a very good job in showing just how astounding Poitier\u2019s self-invention was, considering his early poverty, a story almost Dickensian in its drama and romance. And Hudlin tells us about some movies in Poitier\u2019s CV that may have been forgotten: like the very interesting Something of Value from 1957, another black\/white pairing (this one with the Rock Hudson), set in Kenya at the time of the Mau Mau uprising. It is a far more confrontational film, with Poitier in a more brutal and less emollient role, which has been allowed to disappear.This documentary is a spirited rebuke to the \u201csellout\u201d narrative which has been allowed to grow up around his career, and a paean of praise to his commitment, talent and heroism.

Jennifer Lawrence plays Lynsey, a serving soldier in the US military who has been sent home from Afghanistan, suffering from a traumatic brain injury after the explosion of two roadside bombs. Lynsey now has anxiety, disorientation, memory loss and physical coordination issues.After therapy from a kindly nurse, Sharon (Jayne Houdyshell), Lynsey has to live with her mom, Gloria (Linda Emond), who is a bit of a drinker and perhaps not providing the exact environment she needs. To the astonished dismay of her physician and family, Lynsey is keen not merely to get better, but to get better enough to redeploy, to go back into the army and see action once again in Afghanistan. She associates New Orleans with a grim world that might drag her down the way it dragged down her drug-abusing brother; the army got her out of there and she is ready to risk everything once again on the field of battle. At least now she has a friend: the sweet-natured, worldly-wise guy who fixed her truck, James, played by Brian Tyree Henry. Like Lawrence, he delivers a decent performance.But there is something a bit too smooth about the brain injury from which Lawrence\u2019s character is supposedly suffering, with its lack of unsightly symptoms or visible wounds. She also keeps on going swimming in the pools she has a job cleaning. The movie starts with some ostentatiously tough scenes: Lynsey is almost catatonic with depression, she uses a wheelchair, she can\u2019t brush her teeth and the nurse has to help her on and off the lavatory. And then, yes, Lynsey is supposed to have improved through therapy \u2013 a kind of off-camera single-transition montage leap from illness to near-recovery. Now, despite a few picturesque glitches, she has no serious physical problems.Then there are all the pills she has to take. Lynsey is not supposed to drink alcohol on those. But she rashly has some beers with James. Uh-oh. What\u2019s going to happen? Well, it could be argued that the wrong choices and the insensitive moves she makes around James are down to drinking on medication. But again, this looks like another risk-free plot contrivance which never lets Lawrence behave too badly or too unattractively.Everything about this film means well and it is acted with professionalism and commitment. But there is something too easy about it. Causeway screened at the Toronto film festival and is released on 4 November on Apple TV+.","398":"Billy Eichner\u2019s slick Judd Apatow-produced gay comedy, Bros, carries with it the specific sort of baggage that only a \u201cfirst\u201d is forced to carry. As the first theatrically released studio gay rom-com, the first studio film co-written by and starring an openly gay man and the first studio film with a majority LGBTQ+ cast, it\u2019s a light movie made heavy with expectation \u2013 will it be gay enough or good enough or accessible enough or profitable enough \u2013 an unfair yet unavoidable heap of crosses to bear.Eichner is of course acutely aware of this and so is his film, through-lined with fears over the difficulties of making gay art, how to feel important as a gay person and how to exist and excel in a culture dominated by straight people (should we beat them or join them?). His comedy, best known from Billy on the Street and the short-lived series Difficult People, has always been intense and anxiety-ridden, he has a nervy energy that\u2019s uncomfortably infectious to watch (\u201cName a woman!\u201d), and it tracks that his first film as a writer would be also filled with existential gay angst.His character Bobby is a version of himself just a few degrees to the left \u2013 a successful podcaster who prides himself on being single and self-sufficient, existing on the intimacy of friendships and the brief pleasure of random hookups while balking at the ways that other gays choose to define themselves and their romantic lives. He rolls his eyes at marriage, throuples and shirtless circuit party gym bros \u2013 that is until he meets one of them, who upends his expectations. Aaron (Luke Macfarlane) is introduced to him as hot but boring and so Bobby is surprised when he finds something more substantive and slowly romantic. The two men, who have chosen a life devoid of commitment, have to navigate how the alternative might work.There\u2019s a tension throughout Bros between making a gay film and making The Gay Film We Need Right Now, the micro vs the macro, and it\u2019s something that takes Eichner, and co-writer\/director Nicholas Stoller, some time to iron out. In the opening stretch, a few too many lines of dialogue feel closer to Twitter takes, plainly stated \u201cthe thing about \u2026 is\u201d witticisms, a strain to always be \u201csaying something\u201d rather than just speaking. But Eichner\u2019s confidence in how he chooses to get his many points across soon grows, embedded within the plot with more dexterity. And when the balance between the rom, the com and the commentary works, Bros really flies.One of Billy-Bobby\u2019s complaints about the increased acceptance of gay culture \u2013 the assertion that love is love, that gay relationships are just the same as straight ones \u2013 is something that the character and the film around him are eager to disprove. Despite the gloss and the wide release that Bros is about to be given, Eichner isn\u2019t that interested in pandering to straight audiences, to over-explain what poppers are or what Grindr is or worry if he\u2019s putting them off. He trusts them enough to figure it out or if they don\u2019t, he\u2019s too busy elsewhere to care.There\u2019s rich detail in the small character moments, like both men sadly recalling the jobs they wanted to have as kids before they worried about how gay that would make them seem, and unlike so many other loosely autobiographical concoctions that have been more clouded by ego, he\u2019s willing to make his character believably unlikeable at important moments. I\u2019d argue he could have been a bit harder on himself, especially in the grand romantic apology-filled finale which falls a little too heavily on the shoulders of the other bro, but in a subgenre filled with writers creepily insisting their loveliness, it\u2019s better and knottier than the norm.Eichner also manages to make a surprisingly convincing segue from comedy bit-player to leading man, not just delivering on the many funny moments (toning down his trademark manic delivery is key) but doing a more-than-competent job at the messier stuff too (there\u2019s a particularly effective monologue on the beach in Provincetown about being seen as \u201ctoo gay\u201d). Inevitably Macfarlane\u2019s bro gets a little less texture and at times his existence and some of his dialogue borders on fan fiction (he tells Bobby how incredible he is on numerous occasions but the same is rarely said back to him) but the actor, a Hallmark Channel stalwart, makes for a charming vision of what a dream boyfriend could be. The supporting cast, made almost entirely of LGBTQ+ actors (bar two smart cameos from Debra Messing and Kristin Chenoweth and some other surprises at the end), are strong in small bursts, and the scenes of Eichner warring with other group representatives in the fight to open an LGBTQ+ museum are very amusing.Pairing Eichner with Forgetting Sarah Marshall\u2019s Stoller, who knows how to deliver a crowd-pleasing studio comedy, gives Bros that sleek efficiency that comes with the best Apatow productions, the familiar mixture of genuine laughter, cutting insight and sugar-free warmth (it also has the slightly baggy runtime that has become a less desirable ingredient). It\u2019s big and clever in a way that so few films of this scale are these days \u2013 a pleasure to be shepherded through the easy motions of a romantic comedy by people who know what they\u2019re doing for once, and manages to walk a difficult tightrope without falling, despite the heft of baggage. It might not be The Gay Film We Need Right Now (is anything worthy of that title?) but it\u2019ll be one that many of us will want instead.Bros is screening at the Toronto film festival and will be released in the US on 30 September and in the UK on 28 October","399":"Bethlehem Hospital is the legendary institution which gave rise to the word \u201cbedlam\u201d \u2013 its name has been reapplied, without obvious irony, to a fictional geriatric hospital in Yorkshire for this gentle, shrewd ensemble comedy, adapted by screenwriter Heidi Thomas from the much-admired 2018 stage play by Alan Bennett with a new Covid-aware coda bolted on to the end. Richard Eyre directs with a sure hand.The \u201cBeth\u201d is a small community facility which has attracted donations from celebrities after whom various parts of the building are named: the film is mostly set in the Shirley Bassey ward. But it is facing closure from hardfaced Whitehall bean-counters who want giant cost-efficient hospitals or glitzy \u201ccentres of excellence\u201d with measurable success rates. Humble, unglamorous geriatric care is however about vulnerable patients who are heading just one way, and their treatment crucially involves kindness and compassion which have nothing to do with the bottom line.Russell Tovey plays Colin, a Department of Health consultant with precisely these prejudices who has to come and visit his ailing ex-miner dad Joe (David Bradley) at the Beth, a cantankerous old guy who has never been able to accept his son\u2019s identity as a gay man. There are no prizes for guessing if Colin\u2019s attitude to both the hospital and his dad is going to thaw \u2013 and indeed his initial, shrill attachment to the government line is rather broadly written.Elsewhere on the ward, Judi Dench plays Mary, a retired librarian with a passion for cataloguing rather than books, but a keen interest in marginalia: the readers\u2019 revealing scribbles at the side of the page. More genuinely bookish is the haughty former teacher Ambrose (he prefers the antique word \u201cschoolmaster\u201d) played by Derek Jacobi who broods over the Charles Causley poem Ten Types Of Hospital Visitor. Julia McKenzie is a woman with dementia whose daughter and son-in-law are desperate to keep her alive for a few more months for inheritance tax reasons (again, a slightly broad characterisation, which might have worked better on stage than on screen). Jesse Akele is the indomitably cheerful Nurse Pinkney. Bally Gill plays the genuinely caring Dr Valentine and Jennifer Saunders is the formidable, no-nonsense ward sister Gilpin who runs a tight ship.Perhaps the thought of a veteran Brit character-actor lineup in a care setting is a little mawkish, and I incidentally still have grim memories of Dustin Hoffman\u2019s unsufferably patronising 2012 film Quartet with Maggie Smith, Tom Courtenay, Pauline Collins and Michael Gambon.But this watchable, undemanding drama rolls along capably, enlivened by unmistakably Bennettian gags and drolleries which come along every minute or so. Marvelling at a new invention called an iPad, Dench\u2019s librarian purrs: \u201cIt\u2019s no thicker than a monthly periodical!\u201d Colin asks the work experience kid (Louis Ashbourne Serkis) wheeling around a trolley of large-print books: \u201cDo you want to feel my feet?\u201d The sullen teen replies: \u201cIt\u2019s not top of my list.\u201dThe ostensible purpose and meaning of the film is of course to proclaim the value of the NHS, although you might argue that this faith is slightly deflected or undermined by the big narrative reveal \u2013 inspired by well-attested real life cases. But the new Covid section at the end, with its unexpected pivot to drama and crisis, works well enough. A low-key, attractive, if minor Alan Bennett. Allelujah screened at the Toronto film festival and is released on 17 March in UK and Ireland. This article was amended on 11 September 2022. An earlier version mistakenly referred to Julia Foster instead of Pauline Collins.","400":"Pinocchio has long been a misfit within the classic Disney canon \u2013 the early animated films which solidified Walt Disney\u2019s reputation as a master storyteller and formed the bedrock layer of American cinematic fairytales. You\u2019re hard-pressed to find someone who claims the 1940 original, the second animated feature ever made by Disney, as their favorite. Many found it to be frightening and unsettling, myself included. It\u2019s a weird story, this tale of a sentient wooden puppet who dreams of being a real boy and, among other things, witnesses rogue children transform into donkeys and gets swallowed by a whale.So it makes sense that the inevitable (for business reasons) live-action remake of Pinocchio will bypass theaters and head straight to Disney+. It is an odd fit, less hyped than its live-action cousins, neither quite a children\u2019s movie nor a children\u2019s movie for adults. There\u2019s a strangeness to the whole proceeding \u2013 an unbeloved classic, sanded down from the original 1883 novel by Italian author Carlo Collodi, updated into a 1 hour, 40-minute visually stimulating but emotionally dull mishmash.Disney\u2019s live-action churn through the catalog has resulted in, at best, faithful adaptations that struggle to capture the magic of animation (The Lion King, Aladdin) and at worst, unsolicited cash grabs reaching deep into the uncanny valley (Dumbo, Lady and the Tramp). Pinocchio, directed by Robert Zemeckis from a screenplay by Zemeckis and Chris Weitz, leans more toward the former, though it\u2019s hampered by the fact that it\u2019s just never not weird, on a visual level, to watch a CGI wooden puppet interact with real humans.The film\u2019s central draw is the reunion of Zemeckis with Tom Hanks, as lonely woodshop owner Geppetto, and Pinocchio does offer hints of the sentimental kryptonite that carried their previous collaborations \u2013 Forrest Gump, Cast Away, The Polar Express. Hanks is the platonic ideal of a pathos figure for children, and you cannot help but root for him acting valiantly amid the CGI, trying and occasionally succeeding to anchor this story of a talking puppet to real human emotion. The film is most effective when Hanks fully throws himself into the role of a lonely man who has lost his child \u2013 a real boy, once, and now a wooden one \u2013 and desperately wants to be a father again.That wish, from \u201cthe depths of his heart\u201d, comes true through the magic of The Blue Fairy (Cynthia Erivo), shrouded in misty CGI glitter and, again, an odd visual fit between naturalistic Geppetto and animatronic Pinocchio. (Erivo does remind, beautifully, that When You Wish Upon a Star, the signature song of Walt Disney productions, originated from the 1940 film.) The fairy tasks the boy puppet (Benjamin Evan Ainsworth) with developing a conscience, and assigns wizened Jiminy Cricket (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, voice pitched upwards) with handling moral duties until then. Jiminy, who I must note looks, disconcertingly, more alien than insect, also serves as the narrator and thus the main interlocutor between modern dialogue and the 19th-century setting \u2013 for kids and for parents (\u201cwell of course there are other ways to make a real boy, but I don\u2019t think Geppetto gets out much,\u201d he tells the Blue Fairy).Other moments gesture to the present day, and particularly the conscience-shredding specter of fame. \u201cTo be famous is to be real,\u201d the two-bit, fox-headed scammer Honest John (Keegan-Michael Key) tells Pinocchio, luring the boy with fame and the chance to \u201cbe an influencer\u201d. A scene in which Pinocchio flails onstage to uproarious laughter in a puppet show run by the monstrous Stromboli (Giuseppe Battiston) suggests a meta-commentary on exploitative spectacle. You can see echoes of a Twitter pile-on in the \u201ccontempt corner\u201d of the Coachman\u2019s (a devilish Luke Evans) deceptive Pleasure Island for destructive, conscience-free children.None of these are offensive or off-key, more awkward and ineffective, particularly for a story whose central character lacks much characterization or charm; until the final act, poor Pinocchio is mostly buffeted by the machinations of others. (I spent a lot of this movie feeling bad for Pinocchio, gullible and perpetually confused.) This is mostly a Pinocchio story problem, and Zemeckis\u2019s film makes up for it somewhat in craft \u2013 the spectacle of Pleasure Island is visually dazzling, same for Pinocchio and Geppetto\u2019s escape from the whale. Geppetto\u2019s CGI cat, Figaro, grows from distractingly false to endearing, same for a helpful seagull named Sofia (Lorraine Bracco). Most of all, Kyanne Lamaya stands out as Fabiana, an invented character who befriends Pinocchio at Stromboli\u2019s show; her communication with him via actual marionette is by far the most convincing and moving puppet-human interaction in the film.Often, it\u2019s hard to know what to blame when the Disney live-action remakes fizzle. Is it that animation allows for a suspension of belief that human actors can\u2019t sustain? An issue with the source material? An air of corporate strategy to the whole thing? In the case of Pinocchio, it\u2019s a combination of all three. Either way, something is off \u2013 the film is competently crafted, dutifully acted, clearly labored over with soul, and yet, like its star, lacks a beating heart.Pinocchio is now available on Disney+","401":"Michelangelo Antonioni\u2019s long slide from critical favour may or may not be reversed by the re-release of this late work from 1982, a midlife or latelife crisis of a movie that Antonioni made at the age of 70 and was his last serious solo directorial work. (I would much prefer to see a revival of his tremendous and neglected film The Lady Without Camelias from 1953.)Anyway, this revives his signature themes \u2013 metaphysical mystery, existential anxiety, sexual obsession \u2013 and there are some definite, pleasing flourishes. But unfortunately, as with the later movies of Fellini, there are some softcore sex scenes and a preposterously romanticised and eroticised search for the ideal (and sexually available) woman; the concept of the sexually restless middle-aged film-maker auditioning young women to be in his movies jars a little.Our hero is Niccol\u00f2, played by Tomas Milian, a movie director who is broodingly between projects and creatively blocked. One day he finds himself at the office of his sister, a gynaecologist; she is frantically busy, so he good-naturedly helps out by taking a call from one of her patients, a beautiful, aristocratic woman called Maria Vittoria, or \u201cMavi\u201d, played by the glacially charismatic Daniela Silverio. Simply attracted by the sound of her voice, he impulsively finds her number from his sister\u2019s appointments book, calls her and they soon begin a passionate affair. This bizarre and highly inappropriate advance might in the hands of another director be the subject of worldly black comedy. And \u2013 who knows? \u2013 Antonioni maybe intended, at some level, a kind of deadpan comedy in it. But comedy would be the enemy of this film\u2019s eroticism.Soon Niccol\u00f2 detects hostility among Mavi\u2019s patrician friends and family; there are shadowy threats from an anonymous goon hanging around in the streets and eventually the entrancing Mavi simply disappears, after which Niccol\u00f2 tries to find comfort with another woman, Ida (Christine Boisson), with whom he has a (stylishly photographed) interval in wintry Venice. But she turns out to be pregnant with another man\u2019s child and that relationship also ends in calamity, leaving Niccol\u00f2 to ponder his desolate idea for a science-fiction movie featuring an asteroid heading inexorably out into space.Perhaps the most distinctive scenes are those in which Niccol\u00f2 attends a very grand black-tie affair with Mavi, and senses a blank, unreadable hostility among all the grand people present. They have that same jaded, eerie ennui to be seen in other Antonioni films with a party scene, and it is intriguing to contrast them with formal scenes in a Bu\u00f1uel film. Bu\u00f1uel might invite the audience to step back and savour the surreal absurdity of these ritualistic events, while Antonioni wants you to step inside and inhale the unwholesome, oppressive atmosphere.Identification of a Woman is a movie from which there may not yet be quite enough historical perspective to turn its datedness into period charm. Yet the strangeness and haunted anxiety is potent. Identification of a Woman is on digital platforms and Blu-Ray from 12 September.","402":"Florian Zeller has already devastated audiences in 2020 with his movie The Father, based on his own stage play and adapted by Christopher Hampton, with Anthony Hopkins as the old man being cared for by his daughter played by Olivia Colman while he succumbs to the tragic endgame of dementia. Maybe the title of Zeller\u2019s new film The Son \u2013 again from his own play with a Hampton screenplay \u2013 provides a kind of emotional rhyme or complement to that.The Son is a laceratingly painful drama, an incrementally increased agony without anaesthetic. At the centre of it, Hugh Jackman gives a performance of great dignity, presence and intelligence as Peter, a prosperous New York lawyer whose life is enviable: he is divorced (that situation being now amicable enough), remarried with a baby son, and on the verge of a political consultancy which might give him some sort of superstar future role in the White House.But then his first wife gets in touch saying that his 17-year-old son by their relationship is deeply depressed, playing truant from school and begging to stay with him for a while. Peter decides he can\u2019t honourably refuse; his new wife decides she can\u2019t refuse her husband - and everything is to lead to darkness without anyone ever being able to tell if they did the wrong thing, if there was a right thing to do or a right turn to take, or if the nature of mental illness means that this is all irrelevant anyway. Vanessa Kirby plays Peter\u2019s new wife Beth; Laura Dern is his first wife Kate; Anthony Hopkins has a cameo as Peter\u2019s formidably angry father and the young Australian actor Zen McGrath is Peter\u2019s troubled son Nicholas.The Son is a beautifully composed and literate drama with impeccable performances, especially from Jackman: the sleek Manhattan lawyer gleaming with corporate prestige in his corner office (the faint unreality of the studio sets with the city\u2019s diorama beyond the window work in the movie\u2019s favour). But small things betray his internal pain: his handsomeness is etched with strain and he has never shaved properly: a stubble of sleeplessness and anxiety shows through.I am not certain quite what I think about this film\u2019s Kodak-moment flashbacks to happier times or to the final scene: it packs a sledgehammer punch, no doubt about it, but I also felt something too slick in it, a conjuring trick played on the audience\u2019s emotions, a legerdemain which doesn\u2019t have the meaning of the POV-shifts and reality-erosion in The Father.Watching The Son means uneasily pondering possible influences, such Lionel Shriver\u2019s We Need to Talk About Kevin, or Philip Larkin\u2019s This Be the Verse, or indeed Anton Chekhov\u2019s dictum about what happens when a certain object is produced in act one. But there is something distinctively Hellerian in its pessimism. Peter accepts Nicholas into his now crowded home because it is the right thing to do, but also because at one level he wants to rebuke his own cold and uncaring and irresponsible father \u2013 and in fact engineers an unannounced visit to the old man, clearly just so he can tell him what is happening with Nicholas and then use that as a pretext to dredge up the past.Dern shows how Kate herself is over their breakup only in the sense she is able to accept it rationally, but if anything has a clearer sense of her grievances \u2013 and is perhaps not entirely displeased that young Nicholas could now damage or even destroy Peter\u2019s remarriage. Kirby shows her candid fear of Nicholas \u2013 who is sometimes charming, sometimes unsettling \u2013 and Nicholas himself is candidly angry about the way his father abandoned him (as he sees it), but his attitude is different; he wants something in return for a ruined past.But what? Does he want to bring them back together: if so, it seems to be working, in its way, but at what cost? Or is he simply transfixed and horrified, in a way that adults learn to suppress, by the terrible and unjust irreversibility of the past? Or is he just psychologically disturbed in ways that do not admit of analysis?At a level deeper than this, I think The Son is about the middle-aged generation\u2019s fear of and incomprehension of the young. Peter looks into Nicholas\u2019s face \u2013 sometimes smiling, sometimes crying, sometimes eerily blank \u2013 and can see nothing there that tells him the truth about what his son is thinking and feeling and what he should be thinking and feeling in return. Again: I\u2019m unsure about that showy final scene. But this is such a powerful and literate film. The Son screened at the Venice film festival and is released on 17 February in the UK.","403":"The campaign for gnarly, mostly one-location horror Barbarian has been scarily subdued. Just the one trailer \u2013 light on plot, heavy on mystery \u2013 and that punchy one-word title, a rare example of restraint, crafty less-is-more marketing we don\u2019t see often enough in the exhausting era of trailer teases, teaser trailers, trailer countdowns, digital trailers, extended trailers and final trailers.I\u2019m going to remain as tight-lipped about the specifics, and not just because a strictly worded pre-screening email insisted upon such, but because there are depressingly few pleasures to be had here, and one of them is at least, for a while, playing detective trying to figure out just what on earth is buried at its centre. It\u2019s in the opening stretch, the set-up laid out in the hugely effective preview, that this game works so well.It\u2019s late, and Tess (Georgina Campbell) is arriving at her Detroit Airbnb in the middle of a rainstorm, only to find that there\u2019s someone already in it. Double-booked Airbnbs have weirdly become something of a trend of late, from Katie Holmes\u2019s Covid comedy Alone Together to Winona Ryder\u2019s gonzo thriller Gone in the Night to last week\u2019s Netflix romcom Love in the Villa, but it\u2019s explored with the most thought-through detail here, the awkward ins and outs of how to then cope with such an aggravating clerical error (or is it? etc). Tess is stuck with Keith (Pennywise himself, Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd), who is being disarmingly nice about it all, and after realising that other options aren\u2019t possible for the night (a convention is in town and hotel rooms have all been snapped up), she reluctantly agrees to stay.It\u2019s obviously a recipe for disaster, but writer-director Zach Cregger initially works hard to sell us on the \u201cnope\u201d of it all (Tess even says \u201cnope\u201d at one point, when considering a risky move). She takes a picture of his ID, she locks the bedroom door, she refuses to drink anything she hasn\u2019t seen him prepare, she\u2019s \u2026 aware of the danger she could be in as a woman (the two have a discussion about the differences they face in such a situation). It then makes the ensuing descent into the basement and into full horror that much more mystifying, as Tess, a recently smart and careful woman, turns maddeningly dim-witted, acting in ways that make no sense outside of the construct of a horror movie written by someone unable to find justifications for why a character would act so foolishly. Each eye-roll and head-shake takes us further away from the film, losing us and any real suspense, characters downgraded to chess pieces.The reveal of what lies down below is less surprising than the structure Cregger then chooses to deploy as we are taken to different periods, locations and viewpoints (there is more Justin Long than one would expect), interestingly bold until one realises such diversion is merely that, a way of distracting us from what is essentially a pretty ineffective monster movie. It\u2019s competently made (Cregger could perhaps work better with a script he hasn\u2019t written) but curiously flat, and in recalling films from Don\u2019t Breathe to The People Under the Stairs, only serves to remind us how devoid this is in comparison.The way Cregger casually drifts close to hot-button topics and then decides to avoid them completely could almost be a knowingly middle-fingered statement on how he\u2019s deliberately choosing not to fall into the \u201celevated\u201d horror trap, the what-if-we-just-lived-in-a-society option over what-if-I-told-you-how-we-all-lived-in-this-society thesis. But even that extremely generous reading would require a writer-director with a firmer hand on his material, and here it feels more like someone blindly throwing a net out wide, hoping something might get caught in the process. It\u2019s a defiantly unscary lump of Midnight Madness schlock that gains nothing from showcasing an awareness of the #MeToo reckoning or the damage of gentrification other than box-ticking.It\u2019s a shame that Campbell, an actor of immediate intimacy and warmth, hasn\u2019t found a breakout more deserving of her talents. I\u2019m still haunted by her devastating, Bafta-winning work in Paul Andrew Williams\u2019s BBC3 drama Murdered By My Boyfriend, one of the most effectively gut-wrenching and nuanced stories I\u2019ve ever seen of the specific horrors of domestic violence, and while she gives this her very best, the material never reaches her lofty level. It\u2019s frustrating to watch an actor of clear intelligence glumly navigate a character of deep stupidity, and Cregger\u2019s thin attempt to explain her decision-making as based on the trauma of a toxic relationship is an on-paper construct rather than anything that makes sense for a real person.As Barbarian progresses, and as my interest diminished, it becomes clear that the secretive trailer is less artful withholding and more deliberate deception, because if more cards were laid out on the table, the majority would balk at the very silly game being played. The big secret here is that sadly it\u2019s not very good.Barbarian is released in US cinemas on 9 September and in the UK on 28 October.","404":"It is a curious fact that the Beatles\u2019 debut single, Love Me Do, and the first James Bond film, Dr No, were both released on Friday 5 October 1962. No one could have predicted that we would still be thrilled by the band\u2019s music six decades later, or that the film franchise would still be going strong. John Higgs, however, had the intriguing idea of exploring their creation, development and afterlives in parallel.Though he inevitably covers some well-trodden territory, much of the detail is poignant and entertaining. In the early days of Beatlemania, Ringo Starr\u2019s house was surrounded by fans 24 hours a day. His mother, Elsie, politely offered them sandwiches \u2013 which they took away, uneaten, as souvenirs. A friend admitted it was \u201cawkward, particularly as the toilet was still in the yard\u201d. The rulers of the Soviet Union, anxious about the rise of western youth culture, made strenuous efforts to discredit the Beatles. One article depicted them as monkeys and called them \u201cDung Beatles\u201d, while a propaganda film, reports Higgs, bizarrely \u201cintercut unflattering photographs of [the band] together with images of the Ku Klux Klan, ecstatic pop fans dancing, burning crosses and images of rural poverty from the American south\u201d.When American censors objected to the name of the character Pussy Galore in Goldfinger, they were reassured by pictures of the actor Honor Blackman at the UK premiere with Prince Philip. When the Australian model George Lazenby was auditioning for the part of Bond in the late 1960s, the producers sent sex workers to his hotel room to check that he wasn\u2019t gay.Love and Let Die works well as a collection of sharp and pacy stories, though it is a pity Higgs has a weakness for grandiose flourishes. There were \u201ctruths in [the] screaming\u201d of the girls at early Beatles concerts, he writes, \u201cthat many religions have yet to grasp\u201d. He also offers us a bold overarching thesis, based on Freud\u2019s idea of the conflict between Eros and Thanatos, that \u201cwhile the Beatles represent love, James Bond represents death. What makes Bond different from other spies is that he has a licence to kill.\u201dIt is clearly true that Bond and Beatles embody different attitudes to class, privilege, violence, masculinity and Englishness. But Higgs wants to go much further and claim that they are engaged in a kind of permanent \u201cstruggle for the soul of [British] culture\u201d.\u201cWhen we cheer on Bond, and fantasise about living his life,\u201d he argues, we \u201cunconsciously find ourselves supporting the powers that be \u2026 The spell was massively weakened, however, by the arrival of the Beatles.\u201d Once the Beatles had broken up, the Bond of the early 1970s \u201ccontinued to insist that he and the British establishment were the best in the world. And now \u2026 there was nothing of equal stature to contradict him.\u201dNone of this is very plausible. There has been a vast amount of pushback against the politics and sexual politics of Bond\u2019s world that has not needed to evoke the Beatles as a counterweight. And many people clearly enjoy the films for the suits, stunts, hedonism and exotic locations, and the \u201csophistication\u201d of a hero who can\u2019t resist telling bar staff how to make the best martini, without buying into their values. Higgs himself cites the interesting case of 007 (Shanty Town), a 1967 song by Desmond Dekker, the voice of the new post-independence Jamaica, which offered \u201ca strange mix of topical political reportage and Bond fandom\u201d. It is safe to assume that he had no time for what the book describes as \u201cpost-imperial fantasies of British exceptionalism\u201d.It no doubt makes a kind of sense to say that \u201cthe Beatles represent love\u201d, though love is hardly an unusual topic for songs, but what about Higgs\u2019s notion that the Bond films are \u201cabout selling people death\u201d? It is true that women tend to die after sleeping with 007, that some of the films feature terrifying stunts and that the producers have a knack for tapping into current fears, most recently about surveillance, hacking and nanotechnology. Yet much of the franchise treats violence and death in a cartoonish style far less visceral and disturbing than in the average TV cop show. Higgs himself mentions the scene in Diamonds Are Forever featuring \u201can almost uncountable number of police cars smashing into each other \u2013 often followed by a shot of their unharmed drivers exiting the cars and throwing their hats to the ground in frustration \u2026 people usually survive car accidents in the James Bond universe\u201d.Higgs is a lively writer and has assembled many intriguing nuggets from six decades of British popular culture. I remain unconvinced that the eternal battle between Eros and Thanatos provides the key to them all.Love and Let Die: Bond, the Beatles and the British Psyche by John Higgs is published by Weidenfeld & Nicolson (\u00a322).

He claims to the group that his laptop camera isn\u2019t working, which is why the square on the screen where his face should be is blank. But actually he doesn\u2019t want them to see what he looks like: Charlie is morbidly obese, a giant pool of flesh, hardly able to leave the couch with a walking frame to get to the lavatory, gorging delivery pizzas and fried chicken, with a stash of chocolate bars in the desk drawer. Our first view of Charlie is of him masturbating to gay porn, culminating in a heart attack that almost kills him.But this isn\u2019t supposed to be ironic black comedy and Charlie isn\u2019t supposed to be greedy or lazy or selfish (although these uncaring talking points are not really aired). He is depressed after the death of his partner, a former student from an adult night-school class for whom he left his wife and young daughter; it was a desertion for which he is still guilt-stricken.Charlie\u2019s only friend now is his late partner\u2019s sister Liz (Hong Chau), a tough-minded nurse exasperated at his refusal to go to hospital. His fragile, lonely life becomes more complicated still with the arrival at his door of a strange young man, Thomas (Ty Simpkins), a Christian evangelist from the church of which Charlie\u2019s partner was a member. His angry, conflicted daughter, Ellie (Sadie Sink), also appears to want to reconnect.Alongside it all, there is Charlie\u2019s love of literature, especially Melville\u2019s Moby-Dick, and Charlie is glumly aware that he is the whale, the huge bloated entity that no one wants to hunt down or obsess over or even think about at all. Or perhaps it is that Charlie is hunting the elusive meaning of his own wrecked life, deep in the ocean of loneliness.Fraser brings a definite gentleness and openness to the role of Charlie, and his performance is good, although of course it is upstaged by the showy latex and the special effects, which are there to elicit a mix of horror and sympathy and awards-season love, like a very serious male version of the \u201cFat Monica\u201d prom video scene in Friends.There is a too-good-to-be-true sheen to Charlie\u2019s sweet saintliness; his emotional yearning and wounded niceness are underlined by the coercive orchestral score, and this movie\u2019s concept of death is sentimental and even sneakily religiose. But even this isn\u2019t exactly the problem \u2013 it is the convoluted plot that surrounds Charlie: the weird and implausible shenanigans around Thomas\u2019s background and Ellie\u2019s unhappiness and bad attitude, all indirectly and clumsily revealed. Charlie believes in Ellie\u2019s essential goodness to the very end, but any supposed ambiguity about her intentions and behaviour is unsatisfying and uninteresting. Fraser does an honest job in the role of Charlie, and Hong Chau brings a welcome fierceness and sinew to the drama, but this sucrose film is very underpowered. The Whale screened at the Venice film festival and is released on 3 February in UK cinemas.","406":"Adrian Sibley\u2019s documentary is a genial, if sometimes incurious film about the legendary Irish actor and singer, who began his screen career as a pressure-cooker of rage on the rugby field in Lindsay Anderson\u2019s This Sporting Life and finally became the beatific face of snowy-haired wisdom as Dumbledore in the first two Harry Potter movies.This watchable film goes easy on Harris\u2019s boozing and brawling: in fact, it takes an almost a counter-revolutionary approach to the whole subject. In recent years, talk of Ollie and Peter and Richard\u2019s hell-raising has usually been countered with a frowning diagnosis of alcoholism, and this film simply quotes Harris\u2019s own roistering dismissal of all that: (\u201cI drank because I loved it!\u201d) and pretty much leaves things there. Incredibly, Harris hired a press photographer to cover a week-long post-divorce European jaunt via private plane he took with his entourage, which took in many bars and brothels \u2013 to humiliate his ex-wife, it is alleged, although his high-jinks were covered with giggling hilarity in the papers. Harris\u2019s cocaine habit is hardly mentioned: I suspect because it doesn\u2019t fit in with the essentially sentimental narrative of booze.We go from Harris\u2019s boyhood in a well-off home in Limerick in the Irish republic, his idyllic summers on Kilkee in County Clare, with a large family whose stern, disciplinarian dad was a powerful presence, and then to the Jesuit school where getting the strap was normal. He came to acting late, became a mature student at Lamda in London and, with remarkable entrepreneurial flair, rented a small theatre to mount his own production of Clifford Odets\u2019 Winter Journey (The Country Girl); it led to a job with Joan Littlewood\u2019s Theatre Workshop, West End stage roles and then a stellar movie career, with work in musical theatre, the long-running, long-touring Camelot stage show, and an amazing side-hustle in pop music.The most affecting parts of the film come with his three grownup sons gathering to remember him: actor Jared Harris, director Damian Harris, and actor Jamie Harris. They are still overawed by the colossal reputation which he had cultivated while far away from their growing-up (the boys had been placed at boarding schools). There is something very ghostly in Jared coming back to the sumptuous suite Harris kept at London\u2019s Savoy hotel, where he spent his final days.So where did the rage come from, Jared wonders, the rage that lay behind so much of the excess? Sibley offers a very plausible explanation: when Harris was 19, his promising sporting career was ruined by a diagnosis of tuberculosis, which kept him in bed and which was also socially humiliating because TB was associated with the lower orders. It was in his sickbed that Harris discovered Shakespeare and the imaginative life \u2013 but maybe that surge of imagination fused with a surge of frustration and rage.And how about his emotional life and family life? What was it really like, day after day, week after week, month after month for his wife Elizabeth Rees-Williams who was stuck at home and the boys sadly away at boarding school, while Harris was away on location and on tour, enjoying himself? Sexual indiscretions were an important but undiscussed part of booze episodes, and post-booze amnesia was a convenient route to self-forgiveness. The film gallantly steers away from this. Leniency is the film\u2019s mode of operation, but it wouldn\u2019t work without it, and it\u2019s a watchable study of a unique talent. The Ghost of Richard Harris screened at the Venice film festival.","407":"Rebecca Zlotowski\u2019s sweet, sad film is a drama of grownup sadnesses, lost chances and last chances; a little lenient and soft-focus, maybe, although I loved the bittersweet closing-credits shot of its star Virginie Efira breezing through the streets of Paris in a spirit of philosophical acceptance to the chanson Les Eaux de Mars on the soundtrack.Efira plays Rachel, a single woman in her late 30s who is a teacher, a demanding, rewarding job that she loves; she is thoroughly committed to her students and is at present trying to find a work-experience placement for a troubled kid that she believes in. Rachel is Jewish, and regularly attends a Paris synagogue with her sister and widower father \u2013 a synagogue protected by an armed soldier against antisemitic attacks. Rachel has had a chequered dating history; she is worried about her ticking biological clock and receives warnings from her elderly gynaecologist, a very funny and surreal acting cameo from the legendary documentary film-maker Frederick Wiseman.But Rachel is at the moment secretly very excited about someone she has met at the guitar lessons she\u2019s taking: this is Ali (Roschdy Zem), a handsome divorced guy sharing custody of his five-year-old daughter called Leila with his ex-wife (who is played by Chiara Mastroianni). Ali and Rachel begin a passionate relationship \u2013 amusingly, those guitar lessons are never mentioned ever again. But it is complicated by her relationship with Leila whom she adores, but who clearly needs some time to get used to her. Rachel is aware that she may never be able to get pregnant, so if Ali is to be the One, she has got to persuade Leila to think of her as her new mum. Yet Ali\u2019s ex-partner is always on the scene.Poor Rachel is aware that her relationship with Ali, however blissfully happy and fulfilled it appears to be, is always conditional. Ali could break up with her anytime he wants and take up with someone else, and maybe have more children. Rachel does not have that luxury, but can\u2019t afford to put pressure on him for a commitment without risking exactly that breakup. So making Leila fall in love with her is what she has to do. And perhaps Ali will always favour Leila over her. It all has the makings of a very contemporary and painful love triangle.There are tears for both children and adults, although I felt that Zlotowski never quite dramatises the lives of Zem and Mastroianni\u2019s characters; they are a little two-dimensional compared with Rachel. But it is a gentle, heartfelt relationship drama about \u2013 and for \u2013 intelligent adults. Other People\u2019s Children screened at the Venice film festival and is released on 17 March in UK cinemas and on digital platforms.","408":"Not every Black actor is called to play a church pastor on screen. But those who get the part, get the part. Arsenio Hall, a preacher\u2019s kid, channeled his father while hamming it up as Reverend Brown in Coming to America. Courtney B Vance had flashbacks of his childhood churchgoing experience while portraying the conflicted Reverend Biggs in The Preacher\u2019s Wife, and even took the extra step of getting baptized before shooting began. \u201cWhen we were filming at the church and the choir was singing,\u201d Vance told Jet magazine in 1996, \u201cthe Holy Spirit took over. This isn\u2019t just a movie. It\u2019s the Holy Spirit working.\u201dEven actors in small-screen pastor roles rise to the occasion. All summer I\u2019ve struggled to stop myself from rewinding this old JamIe Foxx Show clip of him as the flask-shooting Reverend Aliz\u00e9, a character you have to believe sprang from formative experiences as a church band member in rural Texas. (\u201cHe coulda been cloudy as Kahl\u00faa,\u201d Aliz\u00e9 says while officiating the funeral of a man he\u2019s desperately trying not to disparage, \u201cbut Jevus made him clear as vodka!\u201d) For so many Americans the Black church is a rite of passage of joys, conflicts and contradictions \u2013 which is what makes preacher portrayals so magnetic, after all. They take you back. Hence why Black church is such an enduring screen trope and, increasingly, real life imitates art.Honk for Jesus. Save Your Soul. doesn\u2019t resonate in the same way, however. The Jordan Peele-produced film was stretched from a 2018 short of the same name and the 90-minute version stars Sterling K Brown and Regina Hall as Lee-Curtis and Trinitie Childs \u2013 respectively, the pastor and first lady of a beleaguered Atlanta megachurch mired in scandal. Their once-robust flock of 25,000 has dwindled down to just five sad sacks. Most of the deserters have found a home with a husband and wife pastoring team who used to be part of Childs\u2019s ministry, and is now poised to overtake it. Fold in a mockumentary-style POV, and it\u2019s clear the film would have you take it for a comedy. So why are the laughs so few and far between?Well, for one thing, rookie feature writer-director Adamme Ebo fixates on the same joke \u2013 the inherent hypocrisy of institutional religion and prosperity hucksters like the Childses. On camera, they project piety. In the privacy of their Escalade, they rap along to filthy hip-hop music. In bed, they praise God \u2013 and mean it. But at no point do we get a sense of what made them such a Sunday draw before the scandal. Brown\u2019s Lee-Curtis isn\u2019t big on Pentecostal-style showmanship. There\u2019s no call and response, no wild metaphors, no grunts or staccato speech runs. There\u2019s just Lee-Curtis railing against homosexuality because, you know, he\u2019s in the closet.Worse, Lee-Curtis has been grooming teenage boys and can\u2019t even help coming on to a young sound guy in the documentary crew. It\u2019s this compulsion that\u2019s cost Lee-Curtis his flock and now has him working overtime to broker a bank-breaking settlement with his accusers so he can get back to the hustle.Not only is this setup not funny. It\u2019s ripped from the headlines. A decade ago an Atlanta megachurch pastor called Eddie Long was sued by a handful of young men who accused him of using his position of power to coerce them into sexual relationships. The scandal didn\u2019t lead to a great exodus among the church\u2019s 25,000 members or otherwise hurt Long, who was also quite outspoken against homosexuality.But there\u2019s no mystery as to why Long held on to his job in the pulpit until he died in 2017 at age 63 from what his church called \u201can aggressive form of cancer\u201d. He was a spellbinding spectacle, and it takes a mega personality to fill the pews, close the book deals and keep TV money and donations streaming in. Brown certainly has the comedic and dramatic chops to go there. But he\u2019s hamstrung by the film\u2019s lackluster writing, sluggish pacing and fidgety point of view. Hall, a comedic tour de force who should\u2019ve crushed the Trinitie role, is let down, too. Honk would have you believe her first lady is the true victim of this scandal, which takes way too long to play out. Trinitie is the one who carries her husband\u2019s water on camera and in the community and is thoroughly humiliated in the final act. And yet it\u2019s rival mega pastors Keon Sumpter (Conphidence) and wife Shakura (Nicole Beharie) who come off more winsome \u2013 mostly because they didn\u2019t get more screen time to evolve their own duplicity.Ebo tries to garner sympathy for Trinitie, leaving her around boys her husband either had seduced or would have if he got the chance. But you never really get the sense their marriage was more than community theater. You don\u2019t feel for them.Black church is all about feeling \u2013 the building, the people, the message. But Honk has none of that soul. At best, the film is an abstract commentary on a culture it doesn\u2019t fully understand; at worst, it\u2019s half-hearted creative license. And at this late stage, sadly, not even Jevus could save it.Honk for Jesus. Save Your Soul. is now in US cinemas and on Peacock with releases in the UK and Australia to be announced","409":"\u2018This is going to be one of the most legendary nights in comedy history!\u201d raves the compere. But we\u2019ll be the judges of that. You\u2019ve got to pick through much myth-making to get to the meat of this rare Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle double whammy. But maybe the hype is justified. These are arguably the two greatest US standups of their generation, and both are hot-topical too, if not always for lovely reasons. Rock got walloped at the Oscars live on TV; Chappelle\u2019s routines about trans people prompted a hundreds-strong staff walkout at Netflix. With background noise that loud, and the claims of their numerous hype men ringing in our ears, can the pair\u2019s comedy possibly make itself heard?It can \u2013 particularly Rock\u2019s, with the caveat that much of it is rehashed from his recent Ego Death tour. He\u2019s stronger here than in that solo show, with some of the lesser, domestic material culled and a tighter focus on his antic comedy and often nuanced thinking about socio-politics. His race material runs provokingly counter to current pieties, as he considers Meghan Markle\u2019s naivety and, in a routine fruitfully developed since the spring, the Kardashians \u201cloving black people more than black people love themselves\u201d. A riff on dating post-#MeToo culminates in a very effective sketch demonstrating that \u201call sex looks bad in court\u201d.When addressing sex and gender, Rock\u2019s outlook is not always the freshest. He admits as much here and makes an effort, I think, to soften the harder edges of his occasional chauvinism. Chappelle shares many of the older comic\u2019s assumptions \u2013 women\u2019s role is to spend men\u2019s money, and be thankful \u2013 but makes no apology for it. Rock sees the funny side of male behaviour; Chappelle, the alpha ne plus alpha, celebrates and even solemnises it. See a closing routine in which, all joking apart, he holds up the Rock v Will Smith fracas as an emblem of maleness: \u201cThis is what men do.\u201dThat\u2019s Chappelle for you: no comic is so skilled at hanging you from their every word, none can switch so seamlessly from preaching to comedy then back again. But the charisma isn\u2019t always backed up by strong material in this set bookended by visits the 49-year-old made to ex-boxer Floyd Mayweather\u2019s Las Vegas \u201ctitty bar\u201d. A story about a brush he once had with Russian mobsters is all skilled raconteurship and minimal content. A lot of the set draws its charge from Chappelle\u2019s unsentimental honesty about his masculinity \u2013 the trips to strip clubs, the cheating on his wife, the beating meted out to the man who recently assaulted Chappelle on stage in LA. He knows you\u2019re not supposed to take pride in this behaviour \u2013 but there are laughs to be had, if not the most savoury, in the knowing and the doing it anyway.During a show that emphasises the affinities between the two acts by placing them side-by-side, both men address this experience of recently being attacked \u2013 their least likely affinity of all. Rock has fresh material on Will Smith (\u201cDid that shit hurt? This motherfucker played Ali!\u201d); Chappelle speaks about how his own assault was hijacked by Rock himself, leaping out of the crowd. Between Rock\u2019s high-octane cultural commentary and Chappelle\u2019s smooth account, there are reminders in this two-hander, albeit sporadic, of how good these comics can be when left to speak unmolested. At the O2, London, on 3 and 4 September","410":"\u201cI tried watching Succession,\u201d says Armie Hammer\u2019s aunt Casey, somewhere near the halfway point of House of Hammer (Discovery+). \u201cI had to turn it off \u2026 Magnify Succession a million times and it was literally my family.\u201d This, it turns out, is not hyperbole.The career of Armie Hammer, star of The Social Network and Call Me By Your Name, ended virtually overnight last year, when the internet lit up with rumours (all of which he denies) of emotional and physical abuse. A direct accusation of rape followed, for which Hammer was investigated but not charged. Three-part documentary series House of Hammer recaps this sorry story then goes further, showing the disgraced actor to be the product of extraordinarily toxic privilege, and pitching his downfall as a battle for the ages: the corrosive influence of old money versus the untameable power of new media.The first episode\u2019s key interviewee is Dallas entrepreneur Courtney Vucekovich, who says she connected with Hammer via Instagram in late 2019. She claims that when they finally arranged to meet in the summer of 2020, their interactions were disturbing from the start. According to her, Hammer left a note reading \u201cI am going to bite the FUCK out of you\u201d, after turning up at her apartment to find her out of town. \u201cI chose to look at it as more flattering than concerning,\u201d Vucekovich recalls. Their first sexual encounter left her traumatised, she says, so she distanced herself from Hammer. But, we hear her claim that he tracked her phone\u2019s location and turned up unbidden to beg forgiveness: \u201cI thought it was romantic. I thought, \u2018He\u2019s fighting for me.\u2019\u201d Further meetings, Vucekovich says, left her with visible handprints and deep bite marks on her body, which she claims she was encouraged to wear like trophies. \u201cI was interpreting that as love. Looking at it now makes me sick.\u201dVucekovich\u2019s story seems absurdly naive in the retelling, but that\u2019s her point. Her account appears courageous and valuable because it demonstrates how, if true, anyone could be vulnerable to coercion and abuse. She is a smart, articulate, successful woman who says she nevertheless ignored what she now believes to have been the reddest of flags.In January 2021 another woman, known as Effie, went public, sharing what she claimed were screenshots of messages from Hammer revealing his sinister, controlling behaviour and a cannibalism fetish. Vucekovich says she recognised the pattern, and the documentary also talks to two further women who claim to have had similar experiences.With Hammer comprehensively cancelled \u2013 his agent and publicist dropped him and movie roles evaporated \u2013 something odd and very modern happened, powered by social media\u2019s propensity for hive-mind sleuthing. A TikTok user went viral simply by finding a copy of Casey Hammer\u2019s self-published 2015 memoir Surviving My Birthright and summarising, chapter by chapter, its account of abuse and excess in the Hammer family, and its suggestions that the rot had been festering for generations.House of Hammer expands on this book, with Casey as a consultant and the main interviewee of episode two. The dynasty is traced back to Armand Hammer, Armie\u2019s great-grandfather who, as the main stakeholder in Occidental Petroleum, was quietly one of the 20th century\u2019s most powerful men. We hear how his huge wealth and lack of qualms about bribery and blackmail enabled him to do whatever he wanted.Armand bantered with Brezhnev and hobnobbed with Reagan; he was convicted of illegally donating to Richard Nixon\u2019s Watergate fund, but later pardoned by George HW Bush. These big names are thrilling but for British viewers there\u2019s a sudden chill of recognition when Prince Charles and Lady Di appear. A sticky tale plays out about large charitable donations, glittering galas and the PR drive that meant Occidental largely got away with the 1988 Piper Alpha disaster, which happened on one of its rigs in the North Sea.Armand Hammer was a man for whom money bought impunity. His life story, combined with that of his unwanted, bitter son Julian, who ran his LA home like a less avuncular Hugh Hefner (and whose own son, Michael \u2013 Armie\u2019s dad \u2013 would grow up determined to destroy him, according to Casey) suggests Armie Hammer\u2019s background as one where extreme privilege was both the cause of and, in reputational terms, the solution to some horrific conduct. Logan Roy et al have nothing on them.","411":"Alejandro G I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, Oscar-winning creator of such movies as Amores Perros, Birdman and The Revenant has now returned to his Mexican homeland for this quasi-autobiographical epic, sprawling across a personal magic-realist dreamscape where fact and fiction shapeshift into each other in ways which are technically stylish and massively insufferable.It\u2019s a quite staggeringly self-indulgent and self-congratulatory film \u2013 somewhere on a continuum between Fellini and Malick \u2013 about a Mexican journalist and documentary film-maker who has been lavishly rewarded in the US and is now receiving a big prize, usually given only to Americans. (I\u00f1\u00e1rritu has, I suspect, a slightly sketchy idea about the working lives of actual journalist-slash-documentary film-makers, as opposed to those of colossally important Oscar-winning feature directors.) But now, at this moment of triumph, our hero finds himself in a midlife crisis of identity, plunged into a rabbit hole of memories and hallucinatory anxieties about his family, his career and Mexico itself.The elegant veteran performer Daniel Gimen\u00e9z Cacho plays Silverio, the award-winning film-maker whom we see first in LA (a surreal and poignant scenario to which we will finally return) and then in his Mexican home town where he is trying to secure an interview with the US president \u2013 an interview the US ambassador is offering to set up on condition that Silverio abandons his criticism of the White House\u2019s anti-Mexican racism. In fact, we hear a bizarre news story about an attempt by Amazon to buy outright the Mexican state of Baja California as a vast fulfilment centre \u2013 a pert piece of satire that alerts us to the fact that this film is produced by Netflix and not Amazon.Silverio is loved and admired by close friends and family but his journalistic contemporaries have something else in their hearts, revealed in the gigantic party thrown for him by his media comrades in Mexico City \u2013 a kind of awestruck envy combined with resentment in the way he has left them behind, commodifying Mexican poverty and wretchedness for the gringos in his films about the experiences of immigrants and the drug business. A certain rancorous ex-colleague, who now hosts a top-rated but horribly crass TV show, tries to get him on for an interview but Silverio fears he will be ambushed with questions about his vulnerable childhood and racist cracks about his indigenous background.He is particularly resented for his hugely successful docufictional epic about Mexico, entitled A False Chronicle of a Handful of Truths, which playfully imagines what the conquistador Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s was thinking and feeling in a brutal yet whimsically imagined scenario of conquest \u2013 a scenario I\u00f1\u00e1rritu later duly re-inserts into Silverio\u2019s story, which has the effect of semi-seriously making Silverio and Cort\u00e9s of equal importance in this New Mexico myth.The film is speckled with brilliant individual moments: there is a stunning sequence in which the streets are littered with the inert bodies of Mexico\u2019s \u201cmissing\u201d: the vanished people claimed by poverty and crime, heartlessly ignored by the state. And there is a bravura scene in which Silverio comes face-to-face with the ghost of his poor old dad and tries to say all the things to him he should have said while he was still alive.There a shrewdly depicted scene in which Silverio, for all his activism, takes his family to a super-rich vacation resort where servants are not allowed on the beach \u2013 and another when Silverio demands the US Immigration official at LAX apologise for saying that as a Mexican national with an O-1 visa he is not entitled to call America \u201chome\u201d. That last one is where the movie seems most intensely autobiographical (but maybe I\u00f1\u00e1rritu and co-writer Nicol\u00e1s Giacobone imagined the whole thing).It is made with real panache \u2013 so much so that you can forgive much of the film\u2019s outrageous narcissism. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu could, if he chose, tell us an equally painful but less grandiose and auto-mythic story about his own life \u2013 but he has exercised his prerogative as an artist and given us this confection instead. It is certainly spectacular.Bardo, False Chronicle of a Handful of Truths screened at the Venice film festival; it is released on 18 November in cinemas and on 16 December on Netflix.","412":"Here is an astonishing work of survival and resilience from Joana Pimenta and Adirley Queir\u00f3s; their docufiction film packs a pulpy punch, yet is also rooted in an urgent political reality. Informed by the 2018 Brazilian general election, this combustible portrait of life on the margins is an engrossing, volatile ride through Sol Nascente, a crime-ridden slum on the outskirts of Bras\u00edlia.Sharing their names with their characters, nonprofessional locals Chitara and L\u00e9a are cast as swaggering half-sisters who watch over a formidable all-female gang. The women steal oil from an underground pipeline and sell the black gold to a motorcycle squad; they create a fortress of their own, rebelling against the disenfranchisement that breeds under the authoritarian government. While their nocturnal escapades offer the visceral thrills of a gangster film, real life is also intimately woven into the narrative. Like her character, L\u00e9a is also freshly out of prison, the threat of incarceration still haunting her every footstep.Working with non-actors is a delicate process, and what makes Dry Ground Burning especially absorbing is its willingness to allow fictional storylines to organically emanate from Chitara and L\u00e9a\u2019s lived experiences. The film feels like a collaborative effort, and its sense of collectivism is echoed in the invigorating sequences where people sing and dance together. The queer dimension of the bond between the women in Sol Nascente offers another avenue of liberation.In the end, reality does tragically step in, taking the fictional elements in an unexpected direction, but the possibility for catharsis remains. In a world marred by political hopelessness, Dry Ground Burning literally and figuratively sets the landscape on fire, and out of the ashes there is hope for a new order free from oppression. Dry Ground Burning is released on 2 September at the ICA, London.","413":"A sex worker, and proud of it, Marie (Call My Agent!\u2019s Laure Calamy, excellent) has a support system of colleagues on the streets of Strasbourg, and a set of rules that keep her safe, in this impressive drama directed by C\u00e9cile Ducrocq. But when her sullen, adolescent son crashes out of catering college and into a downward spiral, Marie must break her own working code in order to buy the boy a last chance to make his way in life. She takes a risky job in a brothel across the border in Germany; meanwhile, mother-son relations become increasingly fractious. In cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema","414":"The Bridgerton effect is prominently on show in this Jane Austen cosplay, which brings colour-blind casting to an otherwise formulaic 19th-century society romance. Noted beauty Julia (Zawe Ashton, a satisfying, spiky mix of feathers, lace and malice) is furious when she is rejected by wealthy bachelor Mr Malcolm (S\u0323o\u0323pe\u0323\u0301 Di\u0300ri\u0301su\u0300) for failing to match his list of requirements for a bride. She engineers a plot, with her reluctant best friend Selina (Freida Pinto) as bait, to put the arrogant Mr Malcolm in his place.It\u2019s pleasant, frothy, unapologetically by-numbers stuff. Suzanne Allain\u2019s screenplay, adapted from her own novel, will hold no surprises to anyone with even the vaguest familiarity with the genteel intrigues of Austen\u2019s world. Emma Holly Jones\u2019s perky direction keeps the plot trotting briskly along, but the standout element is Pam Downe\u2019s playful costumes.","415":"There\u2019s a certain kind of film about film-making that fully buys into the magic and mystery; that devours the dream factory narrative and delivers a warm embrace of a movie, channelling a message about the transformative power of cinema. Michel Hazanavicius\u2019s The Artist is one example; so, in its lo-fi way, is Son of Rambow. And Singin\u2019 in the Rain, for all the sprinkling of behind-the-camera cynicism, is a classic of the kind. Official Competition is none of these. Rather than a love letter to the cinematic arts, this very funny Spanish-language satire, starring Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and Antonio Banderas, is more of a poison pen jab to the jugular. It dismantles the lofty ambitions of cinema as great, important and significant, a monument on the cultural landscape. Instead, it shows us art for ego\u2019s sake, and it has a lot of wickedly spiteful fun doing so.The film opens with a slow-panning shot across the 80th birthday present haul of pharmaceuticals billionaire Don Humberto (Jos\u00e9 Luis G\u00f3mez). A lifesize ceramic collie, a painting of a sad clown, a gun, a massage chair: Humberto surveys it all with displeasure, his waxily well-preserved face creasing into a frown. \u201cHow do they see me?\u201d he demands of the craven assistant dancing attendance a cautiously respectful distance away (the extravagant shifts in focus between the two during this exchange emphasise just how far removed Humberto is from the rest of the world). The billionaire decides that he needs to reframe his legacy. And how better to launder a tainted reputation than by bankrolling a piece of great cinema?To this end, a hot literary novel is bought (Humberto is more impressed by the massive price tag attached to the rights than he is by the content of a book he never actually bothers to read) and a team of top talent is assembled. Lola Cuevas (Cruz) is the Cannes Palme d\u2019Or-winning director with an electrical storm of red curls and a highly unconventional way of working. Two stars are cast in the lead roles of brothers who are violently at odds but bound together by blood. F\u00e9lix Rivero (Banderas) is a global superstar, draped in the trappings of celebrity and success. Iv\u00e1n Torres (Oscar Mart\u00ednez) is a luminary of the theatre who prizes the craft above all else. Both, in their own way, are great actors. Both take an immediate and visceral dislike to each other.The Argentinian directing duo Gast\u00f3n Duprat and Mariano Cohn (who co-wrote the screenplay of Official Competition with Andr\u00e9s Duprat) have a fascination with battling male egos: previous films include The Man Next Door (2009), a story of the spiralling conflict between two Buenos Aires neighbours triggered by a disagreement over a party wall. Territory is at stake here too, as F\u00e9lix and Iv\u00e1n jostle for Lola\u2019s approval during the increasingly wacky rehearsal process that makes up the main body of the film. Duprat and Cohn fill the set \u2013 the headquarters of Humberto\u2019s empire, a grand but soulless modernist temple to wealth \u2013 with mirrors, the better for these preening, self-regarding egotists to admire themselves.But for all the considerable, if at times slightly overstretched entertainment value of watching F\u00e9lix and Iv\u00e1n trade petty micro-aggressions and status flexes, it is Cruz, fiercely deadpan and utterly bonkers, who steals the film. Autocratic, exacting and strung as tightly as a banjo, Lola suspends boulders over her actors to fine-tune the authenticity of their emotional response, and uses an industrial metal grinder for an exercise in \u201cego\u201d.With its blend of scabrous honesty and self-skewering silliness, this may be the most perceptive film about the movie-making business since Tom DiCillo\u2019s Living in Oblivion.In cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema","416":"One of those improbable tales that seem almost too weird to be true, the story of Brandon Lee, the unusually mature 16-year-old student transferred to Bearsden Academy in Glasgow in 1993, holds an enduring fascination for his fellow students. One of them is Jono McLeod, the director of this mischievous exploration of the now infamous case of a thirtysomething con artist who passed himself off as a kid.It\u2019s a limber piece of film-making that blends animation (there\u2019s a hint of the distinctive style of Beavis and Butt-Head in the crude figures and graphic simplicity), documentary interviews and dramatisation, this courtesy of Alan Cumming. The actual \u201cBrandon Lee\u201d agreed to be interviewed but refused to allow his face to be shown. Instead, Cumming lip-syncs his words and delivers an intuitive parallel performance, in a technique similar to that of Clio Barnard\u2019s The Arbor. It\u2019s a fascinating story that starts as an affable, strange-but-true tall tale but ends in a decidedly minor key.","417":"There\u2019s something evil lurking deep within the bedrock, just waiting to be unleashed. This \u201ccursed earth\u201d theme is a central idea in numerous creepy movies, but one that has gained traction with the rise of folk horror: it\u2019s central to the wigged-out witchery of Ben Wheatley\u2019s In the Earth, and to the pastoral menace of a host of new Irish horror pictures. But with his bracingly gory Welsh-language feature debut, Lee Haven Jones presents another angle. Sure, there is something uncommonly unpleasant that rests beneath \u201cthe Rise\u201d, the wild land that the superstitious local farmers refuse to cultivate. But the real monsters, arguably, are the affluent family whose opulent modernist new-build is the film\u2019s location, and the smirking, ferret-faced business adviser who has helped them pillage the land for short-term gain.The Feast requires a degree of commitment; it avoids jump scares in favour of a long, slow build of tension \u2013 so slow that at times the characters appear to be in the grip of a kind of paralysis \u2013 that pays off with an explosively grisly final act. Glenda (Nia Roberts) and her local MP husband, Gwyn (Julian Lewis Jones), are hosting a dinner party. The guests include the couple\u2019s two dysfunctional sons and a neighbouring farmer\u2019s wife. First to arrive, however, is the hired help. Cadi (Annes Elwy) is wild-eyed and traumatised, with sodden hair and a tendency to tread mud across the pristine poured concrete floor. The family might be too self-absorbed to spot the writing on the wall, but the emphatic plotting and pointed shots of axes leave few surprises for the audience.","418":"We\u2019ve all heard about the Japanese soldier who, after the second world war ended, stayed on the Philippine jungle island where he was stationed, armed and lethal, dismissing all signs that Japan had been defeated as enemy propaganda. His name was Hiroo Onoda; he finally stood down in 1974 after almost 30 years of delusional guerrilla warfare and died in 2014. Werner Herzog, the prolific German film-maker who narrates his documentaries in a Wagnerian register (wonderfully parodied in the YouTube video Werner Herzog Reads Where\u2019s Waldo?), contrived to meet Onoda in 1997 and has now written a very short, only partially satisfying book about him. The Twilight World is best described as a nonfiction account of Onoda\u2019s long, pointless mission that phases in and out of fiction \u2013 or vice versa.So why didn\u2019t Herzog do the obvious thing and make a film about Onoda instead? Perhaps because another film-maker got there first: Arthur Harari, whose impressive feature Onoda: 10,000 Nights in the Jungle has recently been released. Stretches of The Twilight World read like a screenplay or documentary outline that\u2019s been injected with prose fiction growth hormones. In the expository and digressive passages, it\u2019s impossible not to hear Herzog\u2019s famous voice ringing charismatically in the inner ear (just as that of Quentin Tarantino resounded unmistakably in his recent novelisation Once Upon a Time in Hollywood). If a less celebrated figure than Herzog presented their editor with a book this slight, they\u2019d probably be sent back to their desk to imagine their way deeper into the psychic jungle, fleshing it out with a few more chapters. Which is to say: we\u2019re here for the writer as much as for the story.This isn\u2019t Herzog\u2019s first book \u2014 he is the author, most notably, of the 1978 travel diary Of Walking in Ice  \u2013 but they\u2019re rare enough to invite the question we always ask when a lauded artist switches lanes: will he make a tit of himself? The start is shaky \u2013 if they ever award a prize for ropiest opening lines, my money is on Herzog (and his translator Michael Hofmann): \u201cThe night coils in fever dreams. No sooner awake than with an awful shudder, the landscape reveals itself as a durable daytime version of the same nightmare, crackling and flickering like loosely connected neon tubes.\u201d Happily, this hallucinatory nonsense is a false alarm: the prose soon settles into a less hysterical descriptiveness, with only the odd surreal apocalyptic flourish. The author wisely trusts in the story he\u2019s telling \u2013 and with one this good, he can well afford to move out of the way.In 1944, young intelligence officer Onoda is sent by his superior Major Taniguchi to Lubang Island with orders to destroy an airstrip, undermine the enemy American forces with guerrilla attacks and await the triumphant return of the imperial army \u2013 a mission he will cleave to for three decades with dizzying literal-mindedness. Taniguchi tells Onoda: \u201cYour base of operations will be the jungle. Your campaign will be one of attrition. Skirmishes, ambushes, unpredictable attacks. You will be like a ghost, elusive, a continuing nightmare to the enemy. Your war will be without glory.\u201d With three men at his command \u2013 the last of whom will be killed in the jungle in 1972, two years before Onoda surrenders \u2013 the soldier first engages the US forces in combat and then, after they leave, commences his absurd, prolonged resistance to a vanished adversary.In Herzog\u2019s account, Onoda\u2019s war assumes the glitchy, totalising paranoia of a Philip K Dick novel. With elegantly insane anti-logic, he interprets all evidence that the war is over as proof of the contrary. Newspapers, leaflets dropped over the jungle from aircraft, radio broadcasts and even pornography are deemed intricate forgeries designed to trick him into surrendering. Characteristically, Herzog envisions Onoda as a kind of existential hero \u2013 his mission obscure, his trials unknown, his enemy vast and metaphysical. Existence and combat are one: \u201cEvery human being on this island is my enemy.\u201d Onoda is also, of course, a bizarre excrescence of imperial Japan, whose pressure-cooker code of duty, honour and sacrifice he takes to self-negating extremes.In its brevity, The Twilight World is sometimes as superficial as a Wikipedia entry \u2013 whole decades are skimmed over in a line or two \u2013 and at times frustratingly withholding. Herzog informs us that \u201cthe matter of those he had killed among the population never quite went away\u201d, but no deeper investigation or reimagining follows. A bit of Googling reveals that Onoda and his comrades may have murdered as many as 30 people during his three decades as a rogue commando \u2013 which would make him one of the 20th century\u2019s weirdest serial killers. The Twilight World provokes \u2013 and thwarts \u2013 an appetite to know more. Nearing his 80th birthday, Herzog gives off the megalomaniacal vibe of one who won\u2019t let old age slow him down, perhaps won\u2019t even notice that it\u2019s happening. I hope he follows up this book with a probing, feverish and apocalyptic documentary: Hiroo Onoda \u2013 Human War.The Twilight World by Werner Herzog (translated by Michael Hofmann) is published by Bodley Head (\u00a314.99).

Skittish, self-absorbed, seductive and terminally unreliable, Ana\u00efs (Ana\u00efs Demoustier) is the latest incarnation of the chaotic femme, the slightly more world-weary European spin on the \u201cmanic pixie dreamgirl\u201d trope that is a fixture in the American indie movie circuit.Loosely inspired by the gamine free spirits of the French New Wave, the chaotic femme tends to be in her late 20s or early 30s and at an impasse in all aspects of her life, with a tendency to sabotage the elements that threaten to succeed. She spends an inordinate amount of time running: the chaotic femme is always late, has great legs and favours short skirts, all the better to flit through various photogenic European city backdrops. Like her predecessors \u2013 Julie in Joachim Trier\u2019s The Worst Person in the World and Paula in L\u00e9onor Serraille\u2019s Jeune Femme, Ana\u00efs ought to be insufferable. She\u2019s feckless, enragingly disorganised and has the attention span of a three-year-old in the throes of a sugar rush. She\u2019s part glitterball, part wrecking ball. In real life you would avoid her like a norovirus omelette. But filtered through the forgiving lens of first-time writer and director Charline Bourgeois-Tacquet\u2019s peppy comic love triangle, she becomes a fascinating, intoxicating presence.The key to bringing magnetism to a superficially annoying character is, as always, in the casting. Just as Renate Reinsve flooded Julie in The Worst Person in the World with an itching, restless intelligence that explains her fickle lack of focus, so Demoustier works a similar alchemy with Ana\u00efs. Often cast in intense, passionate roles \u2013 she was fiercely serious opposite a more flamboyant Romain Duris in Fran\u00e7ois Ozon\u2019s The New Girlfriend; intellectually agile in Alice and the Mayor \u2013 here Demoustier gets to show a more playful side. Ana\u00efs is an incorrigible flirt. She seduces in order to reject, and is comfortably certain that all her (many) failures and transgressions will be forgiven thanks to her considerable charm. And in this she is correct. She is utterly beguiling. There\u2019s a pivotal scene in which Ana\u00efs, in the audience at a literary event, catches the eye of the speaker. And Demoustier so supercharges her performance with charisma, she almost seems to sparkle.It\u2019s a performance that works in tandem with the film-making to give depth to the woman we see on screen. We are introduced to Ana\u00efs \u2013 running, of course \u2013 to the accompaniment of a scurrying, tumbling piano score, like panic-induced palpitations in musical form. Her full-tilt movements are shadowed by a camera that seems to be as easily distracted as she is. It picks up on the essential details, however \u2013 the way that, having finally dumped her half-on, half-off boyfriend and embarked on an affair with Daniel (Denis Podalyd\u00e8s), an older man, her eyes slide away from his hungry gaze, as though she is already casing out an escape route.But while her relationship with Daniel is over almost before it starts, Ana\u00efs is increasingly fascinated by his author partner, Emilie (Valeria Bruni Tedeschi, delivering her trademark breathy, slightly dishevelled sexy\/neurotic shtick), connecting at first with her writing and then through a chance encounter on the street. Impulsive and instinctive as always, Ana\u00efs drops everything, including her dissertation, a job and her cancer-stricken mother, to place herself in Emilie\u2019s orbit.The reward is a sensual brushing of hand against thigh on a beach, a chime of synchronicity on the dancefloor and a cloud-parting moment of realisation. There\u2019s a reason why all of her relationships have failed until now. Why she unceremoniously turfs her men from her bed after sex. The film\u2019s arc might not leave Ana\u00efs as a better person exactly \u2013 the apparent disregard for her mother\u2019s deteriorating health suggests that empathy is markedly absent from the emotional baggage she hauls \u2013 but she does end the picture closer to taking control of her destiny rather than constantly trying to outrun it.","420":"The 2009 horror film Orphan relied on a truly daft dramatic conceit, one that depended entirely on the appearance and eerie maturity of then 12-year-old Isabelle Fuhrman as the parentless child of the title, named Esther for much of the film. But Fuhrman\u2019s uncanny performance, supported by similarly beyond-call-of-duty turns from Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard and adept genre management from director Jaume Collet-Serra, somehow turned a mixed bag into a bizarrely elegant reticule of some distinction.This prequel, once again starring Fuhrman as Esther, isn\u2019t nearly as classy or clever, although it has its own wackadoodle twist, two-thirds in. Even more problematic, if you saw the first film, is that Fuhrman is now over a decade older, which makes trying to pass her off as a nine-year-old even harder, although a certain amount of VFX jiggery-pokery and the use of stunt doubles for some shots has been done to adjust proportions. But if any digital work went into de-ageing the actor\u2019s face, it wasn\u2019t enough: nasolabial folds and periorbital regions don\u2019t lie. This makes a nonsense of the plot, which kicks off when the littlest sociopath reinvents herself to get scooped up by Julia Stiles and Rossif Sutherland as an American upper-middle class couple who believe she is their lost child. While the twist accounts for some of the gullibility in the adult world, it\u2019s a long stretch.The most disappointing thing about the film is that it has none of the spark or originality of the first one and just parasitically drains its source material, incorporating details like the creepy black-light drawings and the borderline paedophilic subtext without adding anything substantial. Even the bland attempt to reprise the voyeuristic sex scene from the original film \u2013 a truly erotic moment with Farmiga and Sarsgaard humping against a kitchen island \u2013 is a poor substitute. Fans deserve better servicing than this. Orphan: First Kill is released on 19 August in cinemas.","421":"This is the cinematic equivalent of the stopped clock telling the right time twice a day: a film full of stylistic overkill suddenly runs into the material that justifies it. Near the end of this otherwise unconvincing lakeside thriller from Canada\u2019s Fuica brothers, there\u2019s suddenly a protracted murderous brawl shot in an ecstatic ultra slo-mo sequence. It dazzles not just on its own terms, but for briefly elevating the film into something innovative, rather than the redundant showboating that\u2019s gone before.Maybe the Fuicas had too much time on their hands. Camping Trip is the fruit of Covid-19 lockdown, and hinges on a tenuous pandemic tie-in. Pent-up party people Ace (Alex Gravenstein) and Coco (Hannah Forest Briand) hook up with besties Enzo (co-director Leonardo Fuica) and Polly (Caitlin Cameron) for some forest-bathing R&R beside a secluded lake. But they stumble on the corpse of a doctor involved in some kind of shady tradeoff, who has dumped a bag of money in their tent; if that wasn\u2019t nice enough, he\u2019s left a patent for a prototype vaccine in there, too. The prospect of instant riches divides the party, with skint Ace keen on scarpering with the proceeds. It\u2019s not a great time for Orick (Michael D\u2019Amico) and Billy (Jonathan Vanderzon), the little\u2019n\u2019large roughnecks who offed the doctor, to turn up at the fireside.There\u2019s not much logic or depth to any of this. Characterisation is puddle-deep, with Ace\u2019s serial dick-flashing predominating. It\u2019s not every day you see protagonists having a bisexual foursome, something that goes weirdly unexplored in the later tensions. Everyone behaves idiotically, prompted by story needs: the first squabble over the loot is quickly forgotten, so they can have an impromptu dance party to draw in the criminals. The actors overcompensate for the weak script with postural, shrill performances. The directors overcompensate, never throwing in one drone shot when three or four will do.Which makes the sudden lurch into an operatic bloodbath, shot with considerable psychological acuity, all the more impressive. Shortly afterwards, there is a second confrontation that\u2019s almost as eye-catchingly lensed, the camera swivelling ceaselessly to reveal and then hide the carnage, a bit like Jack Nicholson\u2019s death scene in The Passenger. The Fuicas don\u2019t hone the choreography as finely this time, but clearly there is some visual talent there. So it\u2019s a shame they bandy it around indiscriminately, like noisy city folk in the sticks. Camping Trip is available on digital platforms on 16 August.","422":"Since its invention, cinema has played a crucial role in how images of war are created and immortalised in the popular imagination. Divided into four chapters, Massimo D\u2019Anolfi and Martina Parenti\u2019s sprawling documentary throws the supposed neutrality of the camera up in the air, probing how photography is more than a witness; it can also be an integral cog in the war machine.Restored by film archivists from the ravages of time, flickering, scratchy footage of the Italian-Turkish war of 1911-12 jumpstarts this cinematic odyssey; it also alights at the Crisis Unit of the Italian ministry of foreign affairs and ECPAD, the audiovisual wing of the French ministry of defence. From a 1911 public hanging of Turkish men in Trieste to the current unrest in Syria, the horrors of war are front and centre, yet organisations such as the Crisis Unit or ECPAD are where images get dissected with critical distance. Training classes at ECPAD, for example, involve analysing photographs for their informational value, instilling in the soldiers the importance of creating audiovisual materials with military interests in mind.In covering such a wide range of topics, however, the film seems to lose sight of what it is trying to accomplish towards the end. The fourth chapter returns to the refrigerated vaults of film archives, stressing the value of preservation work. Yet this section also includes various clips of wartime brutality with no context. Since the previous chapters go to great length to establish the ideology that lies behind the production of such images, this careless insertion of footage tends to defeat the film\u2019s own purpose. In focusing on how audiovisual materials are scrutinised elsewhere, War and Peace neglects to interrogate its own relationship to the images of war. War and Peace is available on 18 August on True Story.","423":"This barrelling action thriller has been billed as a Korean Fast and Furious, but takes a swift handbrake turn into something considerably darker and more introspective. Parasite\u2019s Park So-dam stars as Eun-ha, a Busan junkyard worker who moonlights as an elite courier, ferrying fugitives. Calmly sipping a slushie as she slams her BMW through the streets, bantering with her Hawaiian-shirted boss, she is coasting through this petrolhead playground, until her latest job comes in.Eun-ha is tasked with going to Seoul to run a disgraced baseball player involved in a gambling scam down to the docks where he can flee abroad. But there\u2019s a snag: he is caught by Jo (Song Sae-byeok, channelling Gary Oldman\u2019s linen-suited mania from Leon), a corrupt police officer running the racket, so she only manages to pick up his son Seo-won (Jung Hyun-jun). The kid is carrying the security fob needed to access an account holding millions, and Eun-ha finds herself thrust into the role of reluctant parent with the capital\u2019s bent cops on her trail.It\u2019s a labyrinthine setup for an action film, one that blooms almost noirishly as the chase unfolds and Seo-won\u2019s vulnerability triggers dormant compassion in Eun-ha. As we learn when Jo brings on board a special investigator, she is a North Korean defector (who, in South Korean films, often seem to have almost superhuman capabilities). Against her best judgment, she starts to surrender to the feelings of estrangement and abandonment awakened by the boy. In essence, it\u2019s the same \u201cfamily\u201d message as Fast and Furious \u2013 but it\u2019s a hard-won realisation here, not a contractually obliged refrain.Sometimes the joins show on the bodywork where director Park Dae-min, in his third feature, solders this traumatic material to the cocky popcorn-flick register. If there\u2019s a similar ad hoc quality to some of the plotting, this pragmatism serves the action sequences well. Not just packed with slick driving, they are driven by a furious improvisation, too, from jamming legs in car doors to Jo stapling his wounds shut. Like Drive My Car\u2019s chauffeur gone rogue, Park So-dam is an interestingly sullen, uningratiating heroine, and this bruiser of a film reminds us that even middling Korean genre fare is a cut above. Special Delivery is available on digital platforms on 22 August.","424":"This low-budget Canadian feature has its heart in the right place with a gentle story about folk-singing hippy lovers who part and then find each other again years later. Alas, the production values suggest the crew must have been either interns or working for beer and craft table leftovers. Maybe it\u2019s the jarring disconnect between the TV soap-quality of the digital cinematography and the late 1960s setting \u2013 the latter just looks wrong on this kind of stock. The disjunction is made even worse by the addition of black-and-white archive footage from the time, showing long-haired youngsters hanging out in Yorkville, then an unincorporated village outside Toronto and home to folk clubs and American draft dodgers. Either way, it feels amateurish, although Lisa Kovack and Haley Midgette, who respectively play the older and younger versions of main character Alice, both give fine performances. That said, it\u2019s not hard for them to look good given how ropey the acting is elsewhere.The action starts in the present day when Alice\u2019s documentary-maker daughter Corrina (Karen Scobie) films a homeless busker named Tom (Keith McKie) and shows the footage to her bohemian mother (Kovack). Alice immediately spots that Tom was the same American-born crooner she knew back in the day, a singer with a golden voice that harmonised with her own dulcet soprano. They became lovers and even made a record or two, but Tom got too deep into weed and LSD and they split up. She hooked up with someone else and he went off to the Himalayas in search of enlightenment and a haven from the military looking for more warm bodies to send to Vietnam.Once reunited, Alice and Corrina try to help Tom reintegrate to sedentary life and it\u2019s to the film\u2019s credit that this process is shown as neither straightforward or even entirely desirable. But then writer-producer-director Peter Hitchcock makes it all trite again by tying the storyline up in a neat bow with a bit of science magic and hugs. In the end this is hippy nonsense, less plausible than a tarot card reading. A Song for Us is out now on Prime.","425":"There is a theme emerging on this year\u2019s fringe about male power and its abuses. You see it in Svengali, the tale of a controlling tennis coach, and in Guide to Surviving Masculinist Territory, which is exactly that. It is also central to this one-woman show about the professional indignities of the acting industry.Psychodrama takes as its starting point Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s Psycho and is a reflection, without ever stating as much, on that director\u2019s complex relationship with the women he put on screen. So often, they are both star and victim, framed in the limelight but denied their agency.In Matt Wilkinson\u2019s play, Emily Bruni plays a mid-career actor who believes she has landed the part of Marion Crane in a stage adaptation of the movie by Peter Coevorden, a famous Dutch auteur. It feels like we\u2019re drifting into #MeToo territory but, drawing on anecdotes from an actors\u2019 WhatsApp group, the play takes a broader swipe at a profession too tolerant of artistic and economic exploitation.Bruni, poised and centred on a spotlit chair, is a gifted storyteller, easing us into the tale with its backdrop of humiliating auditions and cliched bit parts in a world where youth and beauty always trump talent. Although her day job in a designer boutique is undemanding, it is a good deal more emotionally secure than her work as an actor, not least in the company of the messianic Coevorden who controls the people around him with a callous disregard for anyone but himself.If it finishes abruptly, leaving us uncertain about the resolution of the unfolding murder mystery, Wilkinson\u2019s production dramatises the industry\u2019s cruel status games with a vivid intensity. At Traverse, Edinburgh, until 28 August. All our Edinburgh festival reviews.","426":"This romcom set in a Manhattan publishing house is about as bland and as easily consumed as a cone of soft-serve ice-cream on a hot day. It\u2019s essentially a sticky extrusion of sugar, trans fats and trapped air in cinematic form. Director Peter Hutchings has adapted a bestselling novel of the same name by Sally Thorne that pits perky executive assistant Lucy (Lucy Hale, from the Netflix series Riverdale and its spin-off Katy Keene) against square-jawed rival assistant Joshua (Austin Stowell, Hale\u2019s co-star in Fantasy Island). He is a Waspy corporate type who turns out to be more pleasant than he first seems.As the title suggests, the two begin their relationship by seemingly loathing each other. They clash over issues of taste, given that Lucy started out in an upmarket literary fiction publisher and Joshua worked for a more mass-market house that published trashy supermarket-bound titles. The merger of their two firms results in the two sharing an office \u2013 desks facing each other across a gulf of class, opposing values and a rug \u2013 as they minister to the needs of co-CEOs Sakina Jaffrey and Corbin Bernsen.As is the way with these things, the protagonists are powerless to resist their mutual attraction, and their relationship turns more carnal in that classic device for inspiring love in such films: the confines of a lift. Before long they have a discreet office romance going, which involves attending a wedding together, spells where they break up and then get back together a couple of times, and a rival love interest in the shape of Damon Daunno\u2019s nerdy graphic designer. All the squares on the romcom bingo card are eventually filled.Nevertheless, it\u2019s hard to deny that Hutton and Stowell have a palpable chemistry. Now that the likes of Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey have moved on to building sportswear empires or flirting with careers in politics, a new generation of blandly good-looking romcom actors need to start cutting their teeth somewhere. The Hating Game is released on 15 August on digital platforms.","427":"Turkish director Selman Nacar made a strong impression with his debut feature, a tough workplace-negligence drama at last year\u2019s San Sebastian film festival. Its indirect narrative style and sense of insidious bureaucratic evasion put me in mind of the Romanian new wave: particularly the performance of Erdem Senocak as Yasin, the bland company lawyer whose task is to pressurise the families of injured employees into signing away their legal rights.Mucahit Kocak plays Kadir, a pleasant young man who, with his more business-minded elder brother Halil (Bedir Bedir), has taken over the management of the family\u2019s textile factory, on the retirement of their father Ibrahim (\u00dcnal Silver). The work is hard, and the factory is having difficulty delivering on orders, but Kadir is happy enough, excitedly making plans with his fiancee Esma (Burcu G\u00f6lgedar). But then his world is upended when an employee is severely burned by an inadequately maintained steam-cleaner and rushed to hospital. Was the worker at fault by not wearing the right safety gear, and being drunk on the job, as the firm instantly and heartlessly insists? Or is this a lie? The man\u2019s wife Serpil (Nezaket Erden) refuses to sign Yasin\u2019s document and an increasingly horrified Kadir discovers that he himself is being set up as the company\u2019s fall guy in case of a prosecution and also that the family and the hospital are complicit in withholding the truth about the man\u2019s condition.It\u2019s a powerfully made film, though I was a little frustrated that it ends before we discover exactly what price is to be paid and what the outcome of Kadir\u2019s crisis of conscience actually is. There is a tremendous scene in which Kadir has an uncomfortable dinner with his future parents-in-law, and is prevailed upon to play the saz (a kind of lute) for them, while inwardly agonising about his family\u2019s secrets and lies. Between Two Dawns is available on 15 August on Mubi.","428":"Another dismal, algorithmically produced digital animation here, evidently the first off the production line from a new US-Spanish company, Skydance Animation, which has the former Pixar chief John Lasseter as its creative head. Everything about this robotically made movie looks derivative and contrived; the videogame aesthetic is dull and the quirky high concept plays like a pound-shop knockoff of Inside Out and Soul.Sam (voiced by Eva Noblezada) is an 18-year-old kid who has grown up in a quaintly imagined orphanage-slash-girls\u2019-home in an identikit US city. She has been plagued by bad luck all her life, not merely in being an orphan (the backstory there is primly never mentioned) but in tiny little things such as bumping into objects and losing her keys \u2013 although this micro-level bad luck could also be called klutziness. Just as she is moving out into her own apartment with a job (I guess no question of higher education), Sam becomes sadly preoccupied with a little kid in the home who is poignantly failing to get a foster family, just as she herself failed to. If only Sam could somehow give her a piece of good luck.Then Sam chances across a black cat in the street, and finds a lucky penny on the pavement; her luck changes, and she realises that this cat, called Bob (voiced by Simon Pegg) can speak \u2013 in a Mike Myers Shrek Scottish accent. And this adorable cat lives in the top half of a secret world where planet Earth\u2019s good luck is manufactured: the bottom half, darker and gloomier, is where the bad luck is. Sam finds her way to this boring non-Oz and comes across many unfunny and uninspired characters, including lucky Irish leprechauns; it seems some stereotypes can be OK.Luck\u2019s script is utterly zingless and contorted; it fails to imagine what the \u201cbad luck\u201d half of this secret universe looks like and ties itself in theological knots trying to explain the purpose of bad luck. The target audience deserves better. Luck is released on 5 August in cinemas and on Apple TV+.","429":"Pulpy yet swooningly romantic, Edwin\u2019s entertaining thriller has perhaps the coolest film title in recent years; it also won the Golden Leopard at last year\u2019s Locarno film festival. Adapted from the popular novel by Eka Kurniawan \u2013 the first Indonesian writer to be nominated for the Booker prize \u2013 this is a bombastic time capsule of 1980s Indonesia that is all about the essence of manhood. Left impotent by a childhood trauma, Ajo (Marthino Lio) can\u2019t get it up, but he can certainly raise his fists, earning a reputation as a daredevil who chases death just to prove his virility.Paved with hair-raising motorcycle duels and even murder plots, Ajo\u2019s path towards self-destruction is cut short by his encounter with Iteung (Ladya Cheryl), a girl hired as the bodyguard for one of the young man\u2019s intimidation targets. Cue the perfect meet-cute where the pair engage in thrilling hand-to-hand combat against the spectacular backdrop of a concrete dumping ground. And like any classic love scene, the camera lingers on their contorting bodies, accentuating the sensuality as much as the speed of martial arts moves.This paradoxical passion and violence is the beating heart of the narrative. Ajo and Iteung get married, and their wedding is followed by a trail of betrayals, homicidal revenges, and prison stints. These blood-soaked deeds are portrayed in a hilariously deadpan manner, which simultaneously pays homage to and subverts 1980s Indonesian action flicks. Considering that most of the baddies are ex-military figures, the film subtly conjures up the brutality that existed under Suharto\u2019s New Order regime, when ideals of hypermasculinity ran rampant in popular culture.An adrenaline-pumping action fest that is ironic in many respects, Vengeance Is Mine, All Others Pay Cash swerves towards the mystical and the spiritual in the latter half, becoming a earnest and potent critique on the trappings of masculinity. Vengeance is Mine, All Others Pay Cash is available on 5 Aug on Arrow.","430":"The French Dispatch and The Ballad of Buster Scruggs have recently shown how the anthology film is often content to supply a carousel of curios to amuse the viewer. But when the individual episodes aren\u2019t merely self-contained but converge into a single conclusion, the portmanteau can supply a narrative kick like no other. Vincent Grashaw\u2019s hunk of American gothic What Josiah Saw isn\u2019t quite as accomplished as Pulp Fiction, whose intersecting trajectories and penchant for petty criminal sleaze it shares. But it has a stubborn, almost literary feel for character that accumulates a baleful momentum by the time the finale hits.Josiah (Terminator 2\u2019s Robert Patrick) is the shock-haired, blowhard patriarch of the Graham farm, which is being eyed up by local fracking companies. Supping his \u201cmorning tea\u201d (read: hooch), he only has youngest son Thomas (Scott Haze) for company \u2013 though the pair are haunted by the suicide of the latter\u2019s mother, Miriam. Meanwhile subsisting elsewhere on the white-trash fringes is another son Eli (Nick Stahl, another Terminator alumnus), a feckless sex offender who is strong-armed into a sketchy heist to obtain a cache of gold from the Roma at the local fairground.Hovering over Josiah and Thomas\u2019s bizarre dinner-table exchanges and Eli\u2019s grubby encounters with low-lives and the law, Grashaw picks away at the family\u2019s festering kernel. \u201cThere\u2019s a hollow inside me \u2013 I can\u2019t ever fill it,\u201d says Josiah\u2019s daughter, Mary (Kelli Garner), a mordant bourgeois pretender trying for a child. When the parties finally come together, over the oil-company offer, lurking psychological horror lurches into the full-blown physical kind. Slathering the climax with a crawling string section, the big reveal is straight out of the sordid southern-gothic closet, but the fragmented structure \u2013 clueing us in early as to how moral corruption seeps outwards \u2013 keeps the film sharp and contemporary. If only the depiction of the child-snatching Roma, which borders on racist, was that considered.That latter aspect is a shame, given the astute characterisation and performances elsewhere. The entire main cast are strong, but Stahl takes the prize as the sunken-faced, swivel-eyed piece of human flotsam who manages one last noble act before destiny catches up with him. What Josiah Saw is available on Shudder on 4 August.","431":"Let\u2019s hope the estimable Brad Pitt isn\u2019t giving us his leading-man swansong with this weirdly exhausting and overwhelmingly unfunny gonzo-violent action comedy set on a Japanese bullet train from Tokyo to Kyoto \u2013 with the film\u2019s frantically hyperactive tempo cranked up in homage to the locomotive speed. This film would be an awful way for Pitt\u2019s performance career to hit the buffers and he is given lines like: \u201cHe follows me around like \u2026 something witty.\u201dIt\u2019s a semi-westwashed version of the bestselling 2010 novel by Japanese author Kotaro Isaka, and directed by David (Deadpool 2) Leitch, all about a bunch of wacky assassins aboard the train, their murderous destinies all chaotically colliding, and all turning out to have more to do with each other than they think.With the whip-pans and crash zooms, the sudden flashbacks, the voiceovers, stylised punchups, shootings and stabbings and inter titles introducing the zany characters and geezer crims \u2013 two of whom are cockneys and serious West Ham fans \u2013 this is worryingly like something by Guy Ritchie. (Although Brad Pitt\u2019s eccentric performance as a traveller in Ritchie\u2019s film Snatch is better than anything here.)Pitt himself, in goofy bucket-hat, nerdy glasses and superannuated surfer dude gear, plays a laidback hitman codenamed \u201cLadybug\u201d whose handler (Sandra Bullock) gives him an easy job, to ease him back into the game after an uproarious series of calamities in previous missions.All he has to do is grab a cash-stuffed briefcase belonging to two other killers: Tangerine (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Lemon (Brian Tyree Henry) who have just rescued the son of a noted mobster from a kidnapping and this money is the ransom they didn\u2019t need to pay. They both talk with poundshop Laarndaarn accents and Lemon has an obsession with, of all the quirky-cool things, Thomas the Tank Engine - an elaborate yet perfunctory character touch which is about 47% as funny and well-observed as it needed to be.Meanwhile there\u2019s another bloodthirsty Brit aboard, codenamed the Prince: a psychopathic high-schooler played by Joey King, who has attempted to kill the infant son of fellow passenger, Japanese killer Kimura (Andrew Koji) and retains a sinister hold over him \u2013 but may yet have to reckon with Kimura\u2019s own father, known as the Elder, in which role veteran player Hiroyuki Sanada comes closer than anyone in the cast to actually being cool.There\u2019s another killer on the train called the Wolf (Benito A Martinez Ocasio) with a grudge against Ladybug, another called Hornet (Zazie Beetz) and towering over everyone in legendary evilness is the White Death (Michael Shannon) waiting on the platform at Kyoto.It rattles strenuously on and on and on with unexciting and uninterestingly choreographed fights, cameos which briefly pep up the interest and placeholder non-lines where the funny material should have gone. Pitt\u2019s puppyish good nature keeps it from flatlining entirely but he doesn\u2019t have anything like the script and direction that he got from Soderbergh or Tarantino or Fincher. And the Japanese setting is handled really cursorily; there are gags about Japanese toilets which should have gone out in the 1980s. This is a tourist ride to nowhere. Bullet Train is in cinemas on 3 August in the UK, 4 August in Australia, and 5 August in the US.","432":"It\u2019s an enduring paradox that for as much time as we spend on the internet \u2013 narrativizing ourselves, intaking others, dissecting content into takes and memes \u2013 very few films accurately capture the experience of social media or the head-scrambling velocity of being online. Recent attempts have fallen flat, either into cheap, simple didacticism (Mainstream\u2019s message of internet = bad) or Zola\u2019s hazy, languorous adaptation of what was a punchy viral Twitter thread. The good ones \u2013Eighth Grade, Ingrid Goes West, Searching \u2013 have managed to convincingly portray the warping force of the digital world through maladaptations of human behavior, with a grasp on a specific micro-era of digital culture.Not Okay, written and directed by 27-year-old Quinn Shephard, aims squarely for the title of \u201cinternet film\u201d. Its protagonist, friendless twentysomething Danni Sanders (Zoey Deutch), works as a photo editor at a Refinery29\/Buzzfeed-esque digital media company called Depravity. Her bedazzled phone is totem, oracle, companion \u2013 she clutches it near constantly, pecks at it listlessly in her dark Brooklyn apartment. With her two platinum hair streaks and candy-colored rings, Deutch, who is also 27, looks like a Zoomer, and Danni calls herself a \u201czillennial\u201d, but her obsession with social media perfection and becoming a New York writer feel distinctly millennial.To the even somewhat online, Shephard\u2019s screenplay will recall a number of late-2010s viral phenomena, mashed up and rearranged into an original story which feels like Spotify radio \u2013 smooth, vaguely derivative, the enjoyment dependent more on familiarity than insight. Like the notorious internet celebrity Caroline Calloway (who appears briefly as herself), Danni is the child of rich parents who aspires to writing success without actual writing. Like Anna Delvey, the so-called \u201cSoho grifter\u201d who inspired the Netflix series Inventing Anna, Danni spins a web of intricate lies that win her fawning friends and, eventually, widespread scorn.Like Aubrey Plaza\u2019s Ingrid in Ingrid Goes West, Danni is a talented mimic primarily motivated by obsession: first, with co-worker Colin (Dylan O\u2019Brien), a weed influencer whose style \u2013 bleached hair, ambient vape cloud, Black slang-inflected speech \u2013 riffs on the internet thirst for e-boy dirtbags a la Pete Davidson. In order to impress him and spite more successful co-worker Harper (Nadia Alexander), Danni invents a writer\u2019s retreat in Paris and photoshops her glamorous time abroad. As in Dear Evan Hansen, Danni\u2019s silly and somewhat sympathetic lie escalates into an unforgivable, attention-grabbing one after a traumatic event: a fictionalized terrorist bombing in Paris that kills dozens.Unable to admit that she was never there, Danni barrels ahead: \u201cIm ok and safe. I don\u2019t have reliable service yet but please know I am alright. Devastated for those who are not,\u201d she posts on Instagram stories. At a support group to bolster her story, Danni meets her second fixation, Rowan (an excellent Mia Isaac), a teenage school shooting survivor turned heralded activist, a la the Parkland survivors of March for Our Lives. Craving Rowan\u2019s celebrity, genuine purpose and preternatural talent, Danni channels Rowan\u2019s trauma into a viral article, a hashtag, and false clout.Danni is, clearly, not a person to root for, and it is a testament to Deutch\u2019s bubbly yet grounded performance of anxiety that we care to see her growth, whether in the inevitable comeuppance or the seeds of an actual bond with Rowan. But Not Okay as a whole struggles with what to make of Danni\u2019s house of cards, other than to illustrate that she can build them, that these things happen, that (surprise!) the desire for validation and main characters can breed a vampiric kind of fame. As in, say, a scroll through Twitter, Not Okay occasionally hits a nerve \u2013 the mini-thrill of the half-second between hitting post and your story hitting Instagram, the dopamine hit of a like with a blue checkmark next to it, the anxious weight of the \u201cseen by\u201d list. A scene in which Colin hooks up with Danni and uses her famous victimhood as dirty talk got under my skin. Danni\u2019s confused mix of feelings toward Rowan \u2013 envy, concern, greed, loyalty \u2013 are a heightened version of the parasocial bonds formed through the Instagram portal.But these moments are undercut by the film\u2019s looseness of tone and time, at odds with the fanged boldness and timestamped specificity of the online. Not Okay feels very 2019 but is set vaguely in the present \u2013 or at least, a time when everyone is always in the office, no mention of the pandemic. At times, it veers into blunt satire of a performative woke, clickbait-y workplace (\u201cDepravity would be honored to give you a platform,\u201d Danni\u2019s editor says when she learns of Danni\u2019s story). At others, it somewhat successfully parses the difference between Danni\u2019s pathological narcissism and anxiety, which is less successfully, often uncomfortably, leveled with the actual trauma of a Black teenage shooting survivor.It\u2019s only at the moving end, which hands the mic to Rowan, that Not Okay settles on something sharp, resisting a tidy redemption arc for Danni and suggesting something beyond an artfully arranged, well-acted pastiche. Not Okay is like many \u201cinternet movies\u201d before it \u2013 approaching uncanny valley, somewhat obvious, just a little off \u2014 but this unsettling darkness makes it a solid entry into the canon of just-okay social media films.Not Okay is out on Hulu in the US and Disney+ in the UK and Australia on 29 July","433":"After almost 40 years, Wim Wenders\u2019s Euro-Americanist masterpiece Paris, Texas feels as richly mysterious and mesmeric as ever: an outsider\u2019s connoisseur-perspective on the US with its wailing, shuddering slide guitar by Ry Cooder which became as much of an instant classic as Ennio Morricone\u2019s theme for The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. It mimicked the desolate beauty of the Texas desert and the micro-landscape of the star\u2019s own weatherbeaten face. He was, of course, the unforgettably gaunt and haunted Harry Dean Stanton, who at 58 years old, and after a lifetime of self-effacing supporting roles, suddenly leapfrogged mere star status to become an icon.Paris, Texas is a beautiful-looking, beautiful-sounding film, although I have to confess to being unsure about the ending (reportedly one of a number considered by Wenders and his co-screenwriters Sam Shepard and LM Kit Carson). However, when I first saw it, I was hugely relieved about the way it turned out for Nastassja Kinski. I had been very worried about a sudden, final reappearance from Slater, the sinister, tough-looking guy that runs the peep show, played by Jarmusch regular John Lurie.Stanton is Travis, a dishevelled guy seen at first walking surreally alone through the parched west Texas desert in a shabby suit and tie, mute and clearly in some traumatised state, agonised by a secret history of guilt and shame. Finally, he is picked up by his longsuffering brother Walt, a wonderful performance from Dean Stockwell. Walt has, these four years, been looking after Travis\u2019s infant son Hunter (Hunter Carson, son of the writer) after Travis suddenly vanished at the same time as his wife, Jane (Kinski).What the hell has been happening all this time? Walt and his French wife Anne (Aurore Cl\u00e9ment) take Travis into their home, if not yet their hearts; and he lives with them in suburban LA, hardly more than a kid himself. Travis opens up about his dreamy long-forgotten plan to live in the little town of Paris, Texas where he was conceived, and he gets it together sufficiently to take Hunter on a road trip with him to Houston where he has discovered Jane is living. It is there he finds her working in a sleazy and somewhat bizarre peep show, a Lynchian touch.The lonely geographies of Texas and the unglamorous Los Angeles suburbs are superbly caught, and Wenders and Shepard indulge a love of motels with their heartbreaking neon signs about TV and air-con; this movie did much to make motels the signifier of roadside reality and the American heartland, and rescue them from the taint of Psycho and the Bates motel. Walt, incidentally, has a job creating billboards, the occasion for some witty scene-setting: he shows us a poster of Barbra Streisand\u2019s face, distorted and foreshortened like the skull in Holbein\u2019s The Ambassadors. There\u2019s a great extended scene as Travis walks across a highway bridge to the accompaniment of a male voice ranting hysterically. Is it the radio? No: it\u2019s a disturbed guy screaming into the traffic whom Travis has been calmly approaching this whole time, and passes with a casual pat on the shoulder.Finally, there are those amazing, climactic scenes in the peep show, a metaphor for Travis and Jane\u2019s alienation from each other. Kinski has the supremely difficult job of showing us Jane\u2019s backstory in just two scenes. As Travis starts telling her their story (without revealing who he is), Kinski shows how Jane is at first bemused, then startled, then moved by what she still thinks is this story\u2019s fortuitous resemblance to her own, and then her devastation at the truth.The sordid loneliness and weird alienation of these sequences, coming after the more reassuring story of domestic comfort and father-son bonding, delivers the film\u2019s enduring impact. It is an eerie, sad story whose meaning disappears over the vast horizon as if on a highway heading away through the desert. Paris, Texas is released on 29 July in cinemas and on 5 August on Curzon Home Cinema.","434":"On 3 June 1991, the Mount Unzen volcano in southern Japan erupted catastrophically, killing 43 people, among them the volcanologists Maurice and Katia Krafft, a married couple who had become legendary for their passionate devotion to the study of volcanos; their daredevil films, photographs and books documented their breathtakingly dangerous closeup study of volcanoes in mid-flow. I first heard of them from Werner Herzog\u2019s film Into the Inferno.But where Herzog\u2019s film has something dispassionate, almost fatalistic in its awe in the face of the volcano\u2019s terrifying power, this film looks for something romantic, celebrating or consecrating the myth of the Kraffts: they loved each other, they loved volcanoes and it all came together on that terrible day. Maurice in fact often casually talked about the probability of dying in a volcano eruption \u2013 although the film shows him talking about it happening to him, not to both of them together. Did they really, in their hearts, think that it could happen? Or did their lifelong acclimatisation to danger inoculate them against that thought?Either way, this film shows how their buccaneering volcanology was born decades before in the countercultural spirit of the late 60s \u2013 they were the new generation challenging the placid dullness of scientific work. They soon learned to distinguish between two different sorts of volcano. The \u201cred\u201d type, with its mighty red rivers of lava was paradoxically less dangerous than the \u201cgrey\u201d type with its explosive detonation of dull ash, rocks and dust, which could swallow you up in a moment \u2013 which is what happened to the Kraffts in Unzen.They really were amazing personalities: almost like children, although they came to be depressed that their work was not inspiring governments to work on evacuation protocols. Perhaps Herzog understood something about the Kraffts that this film doesn\u2019t quite, for all its fascination: the element of the danger cult, or death cult, in their work. I found myself thinking of Timothy Treadwell in Herzog\u2019s film Grizzly Man, the amateur grizzly bear enthusiast who hung out with grizzlies in the wild until one killed him. Fire of Love is released on 29 July in UK cinemas, and on 25 August in Australia.","435":"Great child acting is rare: so is great adult acting, and so is great directing of children and adults. But they all come together in this lovely, beautifully composed debut feature drenched in a subtle but urgent political meaning. It comes from 38-year-old film-maker Panah Panahi, son of the Iranian director and pro-democracy activist Jafar Panahi, who has this month been sentenced to six years\u2019 imprisonment for criticising the Iranian government.It takes the form of a road movie, though that Hollywood term doesn\u2019t really cover Hit the Road, which is part of Iranian cinema\u2019s entirely distinct genre of films shot semi-covertly in a car, and has evolved to avoid Iranian state snooping. It is a mode of film-making using the interior possibilities of the car, which is both prop, symbol, mobile location and means of transporting cast and crew about without attracting attention during filming. Abbas Kiarostami\u2019s Taste of Cherry and Jafar Panahi\u2019s Taxi Tehran are other examples.In Hit the Road, a family is making a tense, hot, uncomfortable road trip in a borrowed car through remote north-western Iran, heading apparently for the Turkey\/Azerbaijan border. The elder son (Amin Simiar) is at the wheel, a quiet young guy who says little but often seems in the grip of an intense, suppressed emotion. Pantea Panahiha is excellent as his mum, sitting in the front passenger seat, bantering drily with her husband (Hasan Majuni) in the back: a shambling, grumpy bear of a man with a broken leg in a plaster cast and a consistent need to smoke. Next to him is a wacky 8-year-old boy, played by Rayan Sarlak, who gives a glorious performance: always clowning around, winding down the window and winding everyone up. Their ailing dog, Jessy, in the back, keeps needing to be taken out for calls of nature.There is an elephant in the room, or rather the car. The family are lying to this kid about why they are on the road. They have told him that his elder brother is leaving the country temporarily to get married. It is a tale that makes the grownups tense and the little boy hyperactive. The film shows us that he does not really believe it, and that goofing around is at least partly a symptom of his unease at this explanation. Is their journey a strange sort of game? Or a surprise? A lark? At any rate, he knows that something is off, and he is testing their lie to destruction with bad behaviour. Meanwhile, the mother panics when she thinks they are being followed (in fact, the motorist behind wanted to alert them to coolant leaking out of their air-con unit) and also panics when her younger son confesses to bringing a mobile phone along, against her instructions, which she confiscates, destroying the SIM card. This is criminal activity. Or possibly antigovernment activity?It\u2019s also about displacement activity: about all the things that the adults do to distract the child and themselves from the awful truth. The mum lip-syncs to an Iranian pop song on the radio and suddenly the film has a rush of Bollywood energy, or maybe Tollywood energy, straight from Tehran. The film brings back in its final moments an uproarious and oddly moving lip-sync spectacular in which the fate of Jessy becomes a marker for their unspoken anguish and grief.Cinephilia is an important part of this film, and the elder son has a scene where he explains to his mum why he loves Stanley Kubrick\u2019s 2001: A Space Odyssey, which inspires a woozy, visionary moment of intimacy between father and younger son. Incidentally there is a similar scene in Richard Linklater\u2019s Apollo 10 \u00bd \u2013 perhaps the Space Odyssey explanation is going to become a rite-of-passage for all film-makers.Running through it all is a streak of sadness and even terror: something they are not quite facing up to. The family is heading for a grim farewell and loss involving not just the elder son, but maybe also the parents who could get into serious trouble and be taken away from their adored younger boy. This family could be blown into pieces. And yet an irrepressible defiance and comic energy bubbles under every scene. Hit the Road is released on 29 July in UK cinemas, and 25 August in Australia.","436":"Representation can be a double-edged sword. There\u2019s undeniable power in seeing oneself reflected on screen, in normalizing marginalized identities, but an emphasis on visibility alone can reduce complex characters to one identity, one presentation, a checkbox on a list. This is the fine line walked by Anything\u2019s Possible, a coming-of-age rom-com directed by Pose star Billy Porter, and in its smartest moments, the predominant internal dilemma for Kelsa (Eva Reign), a confident yet guarded Black, transgender teenager in Pittsburgh who, in her own words, wants to thrive in her senior year of high school rather than just survive.Porter\u2019s directorial debut, written by trans screenwriter Ximena Garc\u00eda Lecuona, relies heavily on such hashtag parlance, which splits the 96-minute film, out on Amazon this week, about evenly between banal (if well-meaning) cliches and fresh fun. Example: \u201cMy best friends make survival look good,\u201d Kelsa says in one of her YouTube videos, which double as voiceovers and effective segues. The comment alone is sassy and an effective introduction to her besties \u2013 diva Em (Courtnee Carter) and punk Chris (Kelly Lamor Wilson), both outsized personalities without much backstory \u2013 but gets run into the ground by the script\u2019s consistent comparison of high school life to the animal kingdom, a la Mean Girls. (Kelsa, an aspiring zoologist, compares Chris to a howler monkey and the feeling of a crush to \u201chaving a freshwater eel in your throat\u201d.)Kelsa, like any high school girl, has some pressing concerns: she wants to get out of Pittsburgh for college in New York or LA. She\u2019s trying to find the balance between uninhibited expression (all three girlfriends\u2019 outfits take a page from Porter\u2019s reputation as a gender-fluid fashion maven) and being treated like a normal teenager; she often invokes the \u201claw of averages\u201d to her single mother, played with almost too-fizzy energy by Ren\u00e9e Elise Goldsberry (Girls5Eva, Hamilton\u2019s original Angelica) \u2013 as in, treat her as any average mother of an average teenage girl would.But true to life and cinematic form, Kelsa is most pressed about a guy: Khal Zubai (Abubakr Ali, giving serious Dan Humphrey vibes), a nice Muslim boy whose Egyptian parents pressure him to attend a \u201cgood\u201d four-year university. (It is refreshing to see a character aspire to attend a local trade school, instead of the Ivy League dreams of protagonists in recent teen films such as the To All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before trilogy, Along for the Ride and Hello, Goodbye and Everything in Between.)Khal, stammering and sweet, reciprocates Kelsa\u2019s attraction, and the first half of the film is an immersive fall into like, then love, with them \u2013 despite Em\u2019s stated interest in Khal, a roadblock that feels more contrivance than convincing. The two are bashful and endearingly awkward in person, but self-assured and confessional online \u2013 Kelsa in her YouTube videos, which evolve from diaristic accounts of hormone blockers to laments of making everything about gender to just relishing a crush; Khal as an anonymous Redditer in r\/relationships, where he both dispenses and seeks advice (Lecuona has said a real Reddit post about asking out a trans girl inspired the screenplay.)At times, the film gestures at thorny contradictions \u2013 Kelsa wants to speak directly about \u201ctrans stuff\u201d on her public YouTube channel, but doesn\u2019t want too much attention, wants Khal to care for all of her but not focus her trans-ness, wants to be seen and loved but not fought for. These paradoxes are specific to Kelsa\u2019s experience but also broadly relatable to adolescence in the internet age, figuring out one\u2019s identity and the balance between expression and over-exposure.Unfortunately, the film hastily buries those complexities in a hairpin twist toward villainy, courtesy of Em and Otis (Grant Reynolds) \u2013 Khal\u2019s best friend, a Black teenager whose blatant transphobia feels airdropped in \u2013 then just as hastily resolves most of said villainy for the sake of resolution. Until the bittersweet coda, the film\u2019s second act devolves into what feels like an attempt to throw in references to as many pressing (and genuinely upsetting) trans issues as possible \u2013 bathroom bans, the false moral righteousness of TERFs, the terrifying experience of going viral on an internet full of trolls, white women co-opting Black women\u2019s pain for attention. Any one of these scourges could have been interesting territory for testing Kelsa and Khal\u2019s relationship with unfortunate, painful reality, but the result is less nuance than a cacophony of tweets-as-dialogue that don\u2019t really add up to anything cohesive.Thankfully, Anything\u2019s Possible is light-hearted enough to glide past all that. Porter films his hometown of Pittsburgh with clear appreciation, though the film\u2019s school scenes are stylistically indistinguishable from numerous Netflix teen productions. With a mop of dark curls brushed over batted eyes, the 31-year-old Ali looks younger than he is, but too old to be talking about SATs and college applications. Still, his chemistry with the dynamic Reign, more than up to the task as romantic lead, is enough to see their relationship through to the inevitable departure into the unknown, open future.The answer often given for a lack of representation, trans representation specifically, on-screen is more, on all fronts, in all roles and genres. Anything\u2019s Possible is another needed step in the right direction \u2013 a just-fine high school romantic comedy about an unapologetic, bold trans teenager on a major streaming platform.Anything\u2019s Possible is now available on Amazon Prime","437":"Daisy Edgar-Jones was a lockdown smash for her excellent performance in the BBC\u2019s Sally Rooney adaptation Normal People, and she deserved better for her Hollywood debut than this uncompromisingly terrible southern gothic schmaltzer based on the humungous US bestseller by Delia Owens. It\u2019s a relentless surge of solemnly ridiculous nonsense in the style of romdram maestro Nicholas Sparks (creator of The Notebook and Message in a Bottle) culminating in a courtroom trial with Edgar-Jones\u2019s free-spirited heroine in the dock as the Manic Pixie Dream Girl Murder Suspect. Defending her is David Strathairn as the white-suited decent liberal lawyer and it is at this stage that this film plays like an all-white reboot of To Kill a Mockingbird with Edgar-Jones somehow getting to play Scout and Tom Robinson at the same time. And the big twist ending is an outrageously evasive cheat.The scene is the beautiful and dangerous marshland of North Carolina in the 50s and 60s, a place \u201cwhere the crawdads sing\u201d; crawdads being crayfish that apparently sing metaphorically, doing their crayfish thing when no human beings are around. Edgar-Jones plays Kya, a young woman who has basically raised herself in a remote shack (there is only the tiniest bit of tastefully restrained five-string banjo picking on the soundtrack). She\u2019s had to learn to survive when her drunken and violent Pa (Garret Dillahunt) drove Kya\u2019s mother away after years of domestic abuse; her siblings fled and Pa finally keeled over. So as a teenager Kya is basically on her own, making a living by selling freshwater mussels to the local store, roaming wild and free on the wetlands in her outboard motorboat and drawing pictures of the local flora and fauna with her amazing untrained artistic talent.Kya is subject to much paranoid misogynistic abuse from the local townsfolk, who are also racist to her only allies: the black store-owners played by Sterling Macer Jr and Michael Hyatt. But two very similar-looking local blond hunks fall in love with Kya. One is a decent young fellow called Tate (Taylor John Smith) who is just about to go away to study at Chapel Hill; she does a bit of kissing with Tate while the lakewater sploshes around them, like Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr in From Here to Eternity. The other guy is boorish high school quarterback Chase (Harris Dickinson), whose dead body is found in the marsh, just underneath the fire tower. Kya is arrested for his murder. She pleads not guilty. So was Chase\u2019s death an accident? Or did someone else kill him?And so the drama drones on and on and on, leaving us to wonder, with increasing urgency \u2026 when, oh when, are we going to get the crucial flashback to which we are surely entitled? The scene when the film shows us, on screen, moment-by-moment, what actually happened, and what responsibility the participants actually have. Well, suffice it to say that what we get is a hilarious and ridiculous cop-out, a cakeist twist that left me yearning for the gators gliding around in the marsh to chomp down on everyone involved. Where the Crawdads Sing is released on 22 July in cinemas.","438":"Satyajit Ray\u2019s magnificent movie from 1963 is now rereleased as part of a Ray retrospective at London\u2019s BFI Southbank, and what a pleasure to marvel again at this film\u2019s freshness, its fluency, its directness, its powerful and essential optimism. Ray\u2019s lucid storytelling always strikes me as a kind of miracle whenever I see this film. He makes the miracle look easy.The setting is Kolkata in the early 1950s and Subrata Mazumdar (Anil Chatterjee) is the harassed employee of a bank which \u2013 though he doesn\u2019t know it \u2013 is on the verge of going under. He is reasonably happy with his lot, with a humorous, distracted manner, often absent-mindedly smoking or eating during conversations. He lives with his wife Arati, whose sensitivity, sweetness and darting glances of insight are wonderfully portrayed by Ray\u2019s great leading actress Madhavi Mukherjee. But their household is crowded: there is their young son Pintu (Prasenjit Sarkar), Subrata\u2019s kid sister Bani (Jaya Bachchan) and also his elderly parents \u2013 mother (Sefalika Devi) and grumpy father (Haren Chatterjee), a retired teacher who is enviously obsessed with the fact that all his ex-pupils seem to be well off while he is ending his days hardly more than a pauper in the home of his not-particularly-well-off grownup son.Keenly aware of the need for more housekeeping money, Arati upends everything her menfolk know about life. She boldly applies for and gets a job as a door-to-door saleswoman, ringing on doorbells and encouraging the lady of the house to buy from her a state-of-the-art knitting machine, with which, she promises, you can run up a jumper in an hour. (The firm is evidently the Kolkata franchise of a western company, Autoknit, whose white models are up on posters in the city\u2019s branch office.)After a nervous start, the smart and personable Arati is a huge success: she is the star of this movie and now the star of her own breadwinning family life, much admired by her grinning boss Mr Mukherjee (Haradhan Bannerjee). Encouraged by her flighty new best friend at work, an Anglo-Indian woman called Edith (Vicky Redwood), Arati uses lipstick and becomes a modern woman about town in sunglasses. Meanwhile, her husband is thoroughly humiliated and emasculated by his wife\u2019s sensational triumph; her father-in-law is increasingly hostile for the same reasons, and Arati\u2019s success accelerates his own depression. This creates a diplomatic froideur with Subrata, whose mother also disapproves of the upstart new job. In an attempt to defend Arati, Subrata says: \u201cDo you know what Bernard Shaw says about working women \u2026? Oh \u2026 forget it.\u201d (I always wonder what Subrata was about to quote. Perhaps it was: \u201cThe domestic career is no more natural to all women than the military career is natural to all men.\u201d)The poor ailing old dad, perhaps out of some masochistic need to prove to himself how well the young people are doing and how poor he is, tours the city in the burning sun asking for favours from his old pupils. From one, an ophthalmologist, he begs for new glasses, after uneasily turning over the pages of Esquire in this man\u2019s waiting room, with its racy pictures of young European women.Mukherjee\u2019s luminous performance as Arati, at once modest and sensual, is an absolute treat, perhaps especially when she is paid for the first time. In the ladies\u2019 bathroom she takes the crisp, new notes out of the pay-packet and fans them under her nose, inhaling and smiling inscrutably at herself in the mirror. What is she thinking? Perhaps it is: this is what independence feels like; this is what a new world of possibility feels like.The men feel it too, in a very different way. Arati is earning as much as them and more, and her work is enjoyable and exciting and modern. No wonder they resent it. Disaster looms, but Arati and Subrata are to be romantically reconciled and her wonderful final lines are: \u201cSuch a big city \u2026 so many different jobs \u2026 surely one of us can find a job!\u201d The big city is the hero, not the villain, of the story: a place where they can start afresh. The Big City is released on 22 July in cinemas.","439":"Veteran French director Jean-Jacques Annaud serves up some high-octane film-making with this old-fashioned disaster movie, composed in a docu-realist style, about the catastrophic fire that engulfed Paris\u2019s Notre Dame cathedral in 2019. With dramatic reconstructions, digital effects and the splicing in of amateur video, social media material and genuine news footage \u2013 President Macron himself appears at one stage to be talking to an actor playing the fire chief \u2013 Annaud rips a pretty swashbuckling adventure from the headlines. A terrifying blaze, flying buttresses about to collapse and molten lead pouring from the roof on to the believers below; and Annaud cheekily intersperses the thrills with a querulous old lady who keeps calling the fire brigade because her kitten has got out on to the roof: France has, as they say, picked the wrong day to quit smoking.There are some startling scenes, all apparently accurate, showing cathedral officials desperately trying to rescue the most precious possessions: the Crown of Thorns, a vial of Christ\u2019s blood, a fragment of the true cross and a nail from the crucifixion. And no one even murmurs the possibility that these are medieval artefacts. As far as these people are concerned: these are the real thing, and this glassy-eyed belief in their authenticity, and the ecstasy at their deliverance, is somehow more important than issues around the incompetence that caused the fire in the first place: it gives the film a slightly reactionary sheen.That\u2019s not to say it isn\u2019t perfectly watchable and it gives us in the UK food for thought. How long before the Houses of Parliament go up in flames in exactly the same way? Notre Dame on Fire is released on 22 July in cinemas.","440":"Solid sports documentaries are 10 a penny. Sports documentaries that delve so comprehensively into the psychology of their subject, which position them both in the cultural landscape and in a transformative moment of their chosen discipline, are less common. Barney Douglas\u2019s doc about tennis maverick John McEnroe belongs to that rare handful of portraits that should find an audience far beyond just fans of the game itself. In this, it has a kinship with Asif Kapadia\u2019s films Senna and Diego Maradona.There\u2019s one key difference, however \u2013 while the subjects of Kapadia\u2019s films are now dead, McEnroe is still very much alive. And while not mellowed exactly \u2013 an evocative device shows the grizzled former champion prowling around the night-time streets of the city that shaped him, New York \u2013 the film finds him in a contemplative mood. Through extensive interview footage, both with McEnroe and those close to him, archive material and some slightly unwieldy CG graphics, the film unpicks the experience of being a phenomenon and a hate figure for a kid who was barely out of his teens.","441":"At the beginning of Amazon\u2019s cutesy father-daughter tale Don\u2019t Make Me Go, a voiceover tell us: \u201cYou\u2019re not gonna like the way this story ends, but I think you\u2019re gonna like this story.\u201d Almost two hours later and the prophecy was only half-correct. For the way that the film ends is a genuine text-your-friends-and-spoil-it-for-them-in-caps shocker, for all of the very worst reasons, a cheap, emotionally manipulative head-scratcher of a twist that leaves one with a sour taste in the mouth that lingers. But even before the dramatic left turn, all the way over the cliff and into flames, this ho-hum road trip comedy drama was already hard to like, an unspecific sitcom of eye-rolls and finger-wagging.It\u2019s unsurprisingly the work of an ex-This is Us writer, a network soap of shameless string and rug pulls, and perhaps ardent fans might find something here to mope over in that show\u2019s recent absence. But for the rest of us, a film that should be radiating warmth and humanity is in fact surprisingly cold, almost factory-made, a drama about the messiness of family that feels far too tidy. The often under-utilised actor John Cho at least makes the most of a rare lead role, echoing similar single dad energy from 2018\u2019s devilishly entertaining cyber-thriller Searching. In Don\u2019t Make Me Go, there\u2019s nothing as nefarious pulling him and his daughter apart but, ultimately, something equally life-threatening.Cho\u2019s Max finds out early on that those headaches he keeps experiencing are in fact the result of a terminal brain tumour, which gives him two unpleasant options. The first is surgery, but with only a 20% chance of survival, and the second is, well, nothing, and facing up to his final year of life. He opts for the latter in order to prepare his 15-year-old daughter Wally (newcomer Mia Isaac) for life without him. But he chooses not to tell her, and instead decides on a road trip both to attend a high school reunion and to track down the mother who abandoned them both years earlier.Appearing on The Black List a decade ago, the annual list of the most-liked un-produced scripts in Hollywood and originally titled A Story About My Father, it\u2019s baffling to see why something as generic and listless as this would have survived the long journey to the screen. It feels more like a sample script than a passion project, written to get staffed on something such as This is Us (timing-wise that may very well be what happened), and there is a clinical competency to writer Vera Herbert\u2019s perfunctory dialogue. But it\u2019s less a believable representation of how actual people talk and more of how characters in a show would, a slick but empty back-and-forth lacking in any detail or nuance, every expected beat from a father-daughter dynamic recycled without energy or thought.It\u2019s a shame, because Cho and Isaac, also impressive in this month\u2019s social media satire Not Okay, try their very best, as does director Hannah Marks, all bringing their A game to a script that barely deserves their C (although Marks\u2019 decision to use Iggy Pop\u2019s overused The Passenger twice in a road movie deserves an enthused thumbs down). It\u2019s their combined effort that crawls this out of one star territory, although I wavered in the heinous finale as the aforementioned reveal crash-lands into view. I\u2019ll often forgive a deranged and poorly foreshadowed last-act twist in a horror or thriller, the heightened territory allowing for such silliness, but in a grounded film that takes itself as seriously as this, it\u2019s much harder to stomach and impossible to forgive.It\u2019s a bizarre act of audience manipulation that only serves to highlight the overall incompetency of the script, relying on something this wild to distinguish itself from the great number of similar family dramas like it. The tears that the film so desperately wants us to find ourselves soaked in never come. Our eyes are far too busy rolling.Don\u2019t Make Me Go is now on Amazon Prime","442":"Here it is, finally arriving on Netflix, the Anthony Bourdain documentary that sparked controversy last year when director Morgan Neville revealed he\u2019d used AI to bring the chef\u2019s voice back to life \u2013 three poignant lines from an email he\u2019d sent to an artist friend. \u201cMy life is sort of shit now. You are successful, and I am successful, and I\u2019m wondering: are you happy?\u201d Bourdain took his own life at the age of 61 in 2018. In the end, the AI deepfake gimmick is perhaps the most interesting thing about what is otherwise a conveyor-belt film with plenty of talking heads, some more fawning than others. (Rule of the thumb: the more famous the interviewee, the fewer the insights.)Bourdain had been \u201ca mediocre chef in a middling restaurant\u201d \u2013 his words \u2013 when his memoir Kitchen Confidential shot up the book charts. At the time, food was the new rock\u2019n\u2019roll, and Bourdain was like a cross between Iggy Pop and William Burroughs \u2013 a bad-boy former drug addict with a dry, laconic wit. At 43, he had thought all his adventures were behind him. Instead, Bourdain landed a TV show \u2013 A Cook\u2019s Tour, later Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations \u2013 which took him around the world. The film-makers have done a terrific job here trawling through episodes, stitching together footage to create a portrait of a man who went out in the world with open eyes, hungry for encounters and meaning.The film is a reminder of just what a brilliant writer Bourdain was. He describes falling in love with Vietnam as being \u201cpheromonic\u201d and, like meeting the woman of his dreams, \u201cinexplicably it looks and smells right\u201d. Fame led to the breakdown of his first marriage. The 250 days a year he spent on the road filming resulted in a friendly divorce from wife number two, mother of his daughter. I was uncomfortable with how some of his friends framed Bourdain\u2019s final romance with the film-maker Asia Argento; blame the woman.Bourdain says at one point that the greatest sin is mediocrity \u2013 a little of that creeps into the film perhaps. Not that Bourdain would have cared. He professed not to give a hoot what happened to him after death: \u201cThrow me into the woodchipper and spray me into Harrods in the rush hour.\u201d Roadrunner: A Film About Anthony Bourdain is available on 15 July on Netflix.In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

She returned to play the mum in a 2000 TV movie version, and now Agutter is back as her original character, 40 years older, in this sparky sequel imagining a new generation of railway children in 1944, a reboot devised and co-written by producer Jemma Rodgers and directed by Morgan Matthews.Maybe it\u2019s a bit self-conscious in the way it revives and reimagines the classic plot points, and there could be historical authenticity issues. Would US army military police really have been allowed to arrest an underage British civilian and transport her across country in handcuffs? But there\u2019s a fair bit of fun, channelling bygone classics such as Hue and Cry and Whistle Down the Wind.Three evacuee kids from wartime Manchester, Lily (Beau Gadsdon), Pattie (Eden Hamilton) and Ted (Zac Cudby) fetch up in exactly the same village where Roberta has apparently stayed on and is now a kindly grandmother: her daughter (Sheridan Smith) is the headteacher of the local school and has a slightly Just-William-ish son called Thomas (Austin Haynes), whose dad is away in the RAF fighting the Germans. Railway Children fans may be forgiven for wondering if any more legacy characters from the original film are going to be revived, or if we will find out if Bobbie really did marry Jim, grandson of the \u201cOld Gentleman\u201d in the first tale, as seemed likely. Well, suffice it to say we discover that Bobbie became a convinced suffragette as a young woman and, on those grounds, comes very close to the blasphemy of disagreeing with Winston Churchill. Now it appears the family apparently have a kindly old uncle, or great-uncle, played by Tom Courtenay, who is something hush-hush in the War Office.Lily, Pattie and Ted roam around the place with their new friend Thomas, getting involved in scrapes with the local kids who resent them, and they get to know the peppery stationmaster Richard, played by John Bradley. But the grownups are aware of tension with the American military police who have a racist attitude to the African American GIs who are popular in the village. This adult problem becomes a reality in the children\u2019s lives when they find a wounded, shivering black American soldier hiding in one of the railway engines in a siding; this is Abe (Kenneth Aikens), who sternly tells them he is on a secret mission and they must not on any account tell anyone that he is there. Earnestly, the four children fetch him food and supplies and agree to hide him in their house.This is a film with a touch more savvy about the real world than its 1970 forebear, at least partly because it has child actors who are the same age as their characters. The now legendary scene from the first film in which Bobbie sees her daddy through the steam on the railway platform \u2013 a scene which has become more iconic than its creators ever quite envisaged \u2013 is echoed and doubled in a new dream that Lily has, in a much more serious context. And there are more shenanigans involving holding up signs to a passing train and getting it to stop. It\u2019s an amiable and ingenious tribute to the innocent, good-natured spirit of the original. The Railway Children Return is released on 15 July in cinemas.","444":"Three Italian directors \u2013 Pietro Marcello, Francesco Munzi and Alice Rohrwacher \u2013 take the pulse of their country by talking to the individuals who make up its future. It\u2019s a simple idea: a series of interviews with young people on the brink of adulthood, exploring their hopes and concerns as they move into the next stage of their lives. But this lovely, thoughtful documentary, which visits cities, suburbs and provincial communities, has a cumulative power.The film-makers couldn\u2019t have anticipated it, but the fact that the production was interrupted by the pandemic brings an added depth to the insights \u2013 youngsters in the process of deciding who they are find their journey disrupted, their certainties shaken. Some talk eloquently, some glare at the camera with cagey mistrust. But the point of this worthwhile and frequently fascinating project is that all have the opportunity to be heard.","445":"Mary Shelley\u2019s archetypal \u201cModern Prometheus\u201d narrative is given an absurdist modern twist by actors and co-writers David Earl and Chris Hayward in this sweet-natured and hugely likable odd-couple fable about an eccentric inventor and his ramshackle robot. Mixing DIY physical-comedy charm (there\u2019s a touch of Silent Running\u2019s anthropomorphic drones in the droid\u2019s boxy movements) with sentimental tragicomic melancholia, this Sundance festival favourite offers a delightful antidote to the horrors of the world news cycle and the cynicism of the blockbuster franchises that currently pass for \u201cfantasy\u201d entertainment.\u201cI was very lonely,\u201d explains Brian (Earl), a singular fellow who lives in a remote cottage in the valleys of north Wales, where he spends his time in his \u201cinfamous inventions pantry\u201d (AKA his cowshed). Here, he knocks together outlandishly madcap creations such as the pinecone bag, the flying cuckoo clock, the egg belt and trawler nets for shoes \u2013 until one day the discovery of a fly-tipped mannequin head gives him bigger ideas. Like an amiable cross between Caractacus Potts and Victor Frankenstein, Brian drags the disembodied head and an old washing machine into his workshop and, with a little help from a convenient lightning storm, breathes haphazard life into a childishly sentient robot.This is Charles (Chris Hayward), a latterday Tin Man with wildly mismatched body parts and a glitchy Max Headroom voice who wouldn\u2019t seem out of place in a Wallace and Gromit animation. \u201cI am your friend,\u201d declares Charles, whose twitchy feet are made for dancing and whose wonder at the world around him (\u201cHow far does the \u2018outside\u2019 go? Does it stop at the tree?\u201d) weirdly recalls that of the young survivor from Room. Brian thinks its best to keep Charles (who grandly adopts the surname \u201cPetrescu\u201d) a secret from the locals, and so the pair spend their days playing darts, cooking cabbages, riding bikes, having pillow fights and watching TV travel shows that give Charles a wanderlust to visit places like \u201cHono-loop-loop\u201d.It\u2019s an idyllic existence, ecstatically captured in a montage played out to the Turtles\u2019 Happy Together. Yet all too soon, electronic adolescence dawns and Charles starts to resemble a stroppy teenager, albeit one whose tiny head looks more like that of an eccentric professor and whose wayward manner will strike a chord with anyone who has experienced older relatives succumbing to the strange infantilisation of Alzheimer\u2019s.The characters of Brian and Charles grew out of an internet radio show and a live standup act that spawned an eye-catching short film in 2017. In that original screen incarnation, the only real narrative tension came from Brian locking Charles in a shed after he pilfered one of his prize cabbages, before sending him off to live under a tree \u2013 a decision he almost instantly regretted. For the feature, there\u2019s clearly a need to up the dramatic ante. Thus we are introduced to local bully and bonfire-builder Eddie Tommington (Jamie Michie) whose family terrorise the neighbourhood; and to Hazel (Louise Brealey), a kindred spirit who lives with her domineering mother and a talkative parrot, and whose company Charles instinctively encourages Brian to court, with tenderly touching results.Director Jim Archer, whose television CV includes stints on the BBC\u2019s The Young Offenders and Channel 4\u2019s Big Boys, says that Brian and Charles is \u201cprimarily about loneliness and the power of friendship and companionship\u201d, a theme this marvellously raggedy film shares with more polished stateside AI productions such as Marjorie Prime and, more particularly, Robot & Frank. Here, the humour is distinctly British, with the nervous laughter of Brian\u2019s to-camera monologues (the film has a very loose mock-doc structure) evoking the spirit of Ricky Gervais, with whom Earl has collaborated on shows such as Derek, with which this shares some tonal similarities.Director of photography Murren Tullett lends a glowing cinematic grandeur to the bleakly beautiful widescreen exteriors, while composer Daniel Pemberton\u2019s score blends nursery-rhyme innocence with an electronic sheen that perfectly embodies the duelling elements of Charles\u2019s fairytale-like character. The result has homemade charm to spare, proving delightfully ridiculous but also poignant. Oh, and while this may not be a megabucks Marvel movie with umpteen fatuous end-credits scenes, it\u2019s well worth sticking around for the Charles Petrescu rap that is nestled away at the very end of the film.","446":"It\u2019s quite an achievement for a film-maker to put their own personal stamp on a multimillion-dollar studio production movie quite as empathically as Taika Waititi has done, first with Thor: Ragnarok and now with Thor: Love and Thunder. Zack Snyder manages it; the films of James Gunn bear the recognisable fingerprints of their director. But Waititi is in a different league. There are moments in Love and Thunder when the film feels like a $185m megaphone, dedicated solely to amplifying the voice of Taika Waititi. Response to the film will be neatly divided along the line between those who are convinced that he can do no wrong and those who find his brand of chipper mateyness and disingenuous sentimentality increasingly irksome. I find myself veering towards the latter camp.We join Thor (Chris Hemsworth) in the midst of an existential crisis, having never fully moved on from his relationship with Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). The hammer-wielding Asgardian with the disconcertingly Oxbridge accent is moonlighting with the Guardians of the Galaxy. There\u2019s a moment, after Thor has defeated a bunch of alien hell-owls on flying bikes, but destroyed a crystal temple, the cherished institution he was meant to be protecting, when he is congratulating himself, in his rousing toff voice, on a job well done. And you wonder if a moment of satirical political commentary has snuck into the screenplay. For the most part, however, this romp, which pits Thor against Christian Bale\u2019s cadaverous God-slayer, is superficial stuff \u2013 a film that brings a greeting-card triteness to its themes of love and sacrifice; that harvests internet memes (screaming goats) in the service of easy laughs.","447":"The sweet spot for period literary adaptations is to combine an instinct for the spirit of the original work with a distinctively modern sensibility. Greta Gerwig\u2019s Little Women handled the balance elegantly; and The Personal History of David Copperfield, in the hands of Armando Iannucci, matched irreverent humour with respect for Charles Dickens\u2019s classic. But this adaptation of Jane Austen\u2019s Persuasion, by the theatre director Carrie Cracknell, from a screenplay by Ron Bass and Alice Victoria Winslow, is a travesty.The gauzy melancholy of Austen\u2019s story about lost loves reunited is mothballed in favour of a sassy romcom reading of the material. Anne Elliot (Dakota Johnson) was persuaded not to marry the then penniless Frederick Wentworth (Cosmo Jarvis) seven years before. But now, with fortunes reversed, they meet again. Cracknell beefs up the humour by having Johnson repeatedly make winking eye contact with the camera. It\u2019s such a tone-deaf device, demonstrating so little sensitivity to the delicate precision of Austen\u2019s writing, that you wonder why she didn\u2019t just go the whole hog and bung in some comedy trombone quacks and an audience laugh track.Persuasion is on limited release in cinemas and on Netflix from 15 July","448":"He was one of the most prolific and \u2013 at the time at least \u2013 beloved English artists of the mid-20th century. Working in watercolour, pen and ink and woodcut engraving, Eric Ravilious\u2019s work combined an arcane Englishness steeped in nature, rolling landscapes and pagan embellishments with a sensibility that was bold in its modernity and economy. His admirers, interviewed in this fascinating and characterful documentary by Margy Kinmonth, include Grayson Perry and Ai Weiwei. But Ravilious lapsed into almost total obscurity until his children rediscovered his drawings some years after his death. Even now, he is not widely known. The film makes a case that Ravilious should be regarded, alongside the likes of Turner and Constable, as one of Britain\u2019s great landscape artists.So why did Ravilious slip through the net? He was, in the words of his wife, Tirzah Garwood, \u201cnot quite a gentleman\u201d, so class prejudices may have played a role. But it\u2019s possible that his untimely death at the age of 39 \u2013 he perished in a plane crash in 1942 while serving as a war artist \u2013 also contributed to his relative obscurity. Rediscovery is long overdue.","449":"Created during lockdown, the latest work from British-Ghanaian artist and film-maker Larry Achiampong is a poetic odyssey, a top-down journey through a near-future England, divided into chapters. It follows a young woman (Perside Rodrigues), known only as the Wanderer, as she travels the country, bearing witness to its iniquities and injustices. Through a fabric of narrating voices, the film touches on race, economic imbalance, the housing crisis and gentrification, among other themes.The approach is superficially similar to the work of Andrew K\u00f6tting, although the playfulness and humour that characterises his travelogues is absent here. There are moments of magic: the loamy folk vocals of artist Mataio Austin Dean, who sings twice in the film, gave me goosebumps. And the film conveys a pervasive sense of melancholy: a kind of real-time bereavement for lives that are increasingly marginalised in the name of progress. But there are moments in which the picture\u2019s wafting lyricism works against it \u2013 points that need, or deserve, to be more emphatically made.","450":"A Swedish teenage football prodigy who is acquired by a top Italian team finds that the high price tag placed on his skills doesn\u2019t necessarily transfer to his self-worth, in this impressive, knotty examination of the psychology of sporting excellence. The second feature from writer-director Ronnie Sandahl (who also wrote the screenplay for the tale of tennis rivalry Borg vs McEnroe), Tigers is inspired by the real-life story of Martin Bengtsson.Erik Enge is remarkable in the central role of Martin. He\u2019s a gauche, driven kid with braces and a notebook in which he writes, in his naive child\u2019s hand, motivational notes to himself: Train Eat Recover. But he finds himself in a world that, while not exactly grownup \u2013 the other junior team members are arrested in a kind of petulant permanent adolescence \u2013 is full of adult temptations and challenges.Ostracised by the fact that he speaks no Italian, and struggling to understand the animosity that\u2019s directed at him by the other players, Martin finds a friend in American teammate Ryan (Alfred Enoch), and a girlfriend, Vibeke (Frida Gustavsson), a Swedish model coasting in a job she no longer cares about.But Martin\u2019s career, according to the slick-suited men who treat young players like expensive additions to their toy box, should come before all else. Lonely, depressed and in crisis, he finds that dark thoughts rush into the hole where his emotional support system used to be. It\u2019s an accomplished, unusually sophisticated take on the sports movie genre, which marks Sandahl out as a premier league talent.","451":"At a crucial moment in this quietly harrowing drama from Justin Kurzel, director of Snowtown, Macbeth and True History of the Kelly Gang, a young man walks into a gun shop with a bag of money and walks out with an arsenal of firearms. What\u2019s remarkable is how horrifyingly matter of fact the scene is, with its casual talk of throwing in ammo rounds and \u201cnice\u201d carrying bags. Yes, there\u2019s a slightly sticky moment when the young man reveals that he doesn\u2019t have a licence, but that\u2019s circumvented when he agrees not to register his purchases. So the deal is done; hands are shaken, money is exchanged (\u201ca pleasure, thanks for your business\u201d) and lethal weapons are sent out into a world where no one is safe.For most of its running time, Nitram is not about gun control \u2013 or at least, it doesn\u2019t appear to be. Instead, it presents a thoughtfully intimate account of the belated coming-of-age struggles of a misfit loner, superbly portrayed by Caleb Landry Jones, who earned best actor accolades at the 2021 Cannes film festival and at the Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts awards, where Kurzel\u2019s film swept the board. Mockingly nicknamed Nitram (his name reversed), this spiky, emotionally unstable figure lives with his mum and dad in mid-1990s suburban Australia. His father (played in almost unrecognisably downtrodden form by Anthony LaPaglia) loves his son, but struggles to contain his reckless impulses, such as giving lighted fireworks to children at the local school. Meanwhile, his mum (Judy Davis, wearing her jagged nerves on the outside) exudes flinty exasperation and resigned defeat at her wayward offspring\u2019s behaviour.When Nitram clumsily embarks on a lawnmowing business, he is greeted by hastily closed doors, until he meets Helen (Essie Davis). An eccentric woman of wealth with a menagerie of dogs and cats, Helen buys the overgrown boy clothes and a car and allows him to move in \u2013 making the break from his parents. For a while, this odd couple seem to be enjoying an off-kilter Harold and Maude-style relationship. But the honeymoon period cannot last, and Nitram\u2019s destructive urges soon leave him alone in the house, with his thoughts and her money. Meanwhile, his dad\u2019s dreams of setting up a rural bed and breakfast suffer a setback that sends him spiralling into depression, to the horror of his son.Screenwriter Shaun Grant, who previously collaborated with Kurzel on Snowtown and True History of the Kelly Gang, began working on the script for Nitram, which he calls \u201can anti-gun film\u201d, after being in the US in 2018 in the wake of two mass shootings and seeing a former athlete on TV vigorously defending his right to own a semi-automatic hunting rifle. Recalling the Port Arthur massacre of 1996, which still hung like a dark cloud over his home country (it was the worst mass shooting in Australian history, leaving 35 people dead and 23 others wounded), Grant resolved to write a script around that still-raw wound. It would, he hoped, cause \u201cthe audience, especially those pro-gun, to sit with a character who clearly should not have access to firearms and watch as they are so easily granted access to them\u201d.For better or worse, Nitram, which aroused great consternation in Tasmania for daring \u2013 or perhaps presuming \u2013 to dramatise such horrific recent history, does exactly that. It places its audience in the deeply uncomfortable position of watching a young man\u2019s mental health issues accelerate inexorably from a personal problem to a national catastrophe by the insane addition of easily accessible guns. Impressively, the film avoids portraying its central character \u2013 a stranger to remorse who replaces empathy with aggression \u2013 as either monstrous or sympathetic. He may have suffered taunting bullying as a kid, but when the surfers with whom he pathetically hopes to ingratiate himself give him the cold shoulder, we understand why.This is as it should be for a film that ultimately is not about its titular character (or his unnamed real-life inspiration), whose crimes are kept offscreen. We never see the devastation he wreaks, nor do we need to. All the horror the film needs to tell its story is there in that gun shop.","452":"After a brief but well-regarded segue into the Marvel universe with Doctor Strange, director Scott Derrickson returns to his horror-drama roots with The Black Phone, a solid, spooky period chiller. Like his breakthrough picture, The Exorcism of Emily Rose, it combines conventional horror themes \u2013 in this case a masked child murderer (fully and terrifyingly inhabited by Ethan Hawke) and a supernatural element \u2013 with a rewarding depth of dramatic detail. The backdrop, blue-collar Denver in the late 1970s, is evoked through a nicotine and spilled Coors palette and the kind of parenting that is hands off apart from the occasional beatings.Finney (Mason Thames) and his sister Gwen (Madeleine McGraw) live in fear of two things: the Grabber, the mysterious man behind a string of child abductions, and their own father, who whips them when any hint of their mother\u2019s psychic ability manifests in them. It\u2019s this ability, however, that might just save Finney when he is snatched. A disconnected phone in the basement prison links him with previous victims, each with a crucial hint on how to escape.","453":"A middle-aged, down-on-his-luck actor, reduced to teaching Maori hakas as part of corporate-bonding exercises, takes a job working with prisoners in a high-security jail. Impressed by the talent and their raw, unconventional energy, he decides to put on a production of Waiting for Godot, in this amiable, French comedy drama, which is based on a true story. Somewhat montage heavy and repetitive initially, the film hits its stride in the unexpected final act. A baggy, slightly defeated-looking Kad Merad is impressive as drama teacher \u00c9tienne. But the standout performances are in the supporting cast of prison inmates, in particular the crackling nervous energy of Pierre Lottin, as the jittery, borderline illiterate Jordan, and Sofian Khammes, who brings an unnerving blend of charm and menace to gang boss Kamel.","454":"Big Hero 6 director Chris Williams jumps ship \u2013 literally \u2013 from Disney to Netflix for this immensely enjoyable animated maritime adventure. Aiming its harpoon at everything from Moby-Dick to Master and Commander, the film unfolds in a distant past in which generations of brave hunters have battled with a variety of fearsome monsters of the deep. But what, the film asks, if the real enemy is not the giant fish that is just going about its business, but a power that is rather closer to home? A few slightly pantomime-voice performances apart, this is terrific stuff, a rousing buddy movie between plucky orphan Maisie (Zaris-Angel Hator), fearless hunter Jacob (Karl Urban) and a misunderstood horned monster nicknamed Red. The film features dazzling action and a fantasy world that is realised with an almost tactile level of detail. Seek it out on a monster-size screen if at all possible.","455":"There\u2019s something dispiriting about the kind of hand-holding film-making that doesn\u2019t trust the audience to follow a story \u2013 it suggests a fundamental lack of faith in the language of cinema. Which is why, perhaps, the teasingly elliptical, oblique storytelling of Greek writer\/director Jacqueline Lentzou is such a pleasure. Her feature debut, Moon, 66 Questions, is the work of a film-maker who is already supremely confident in her craft.Showing the reunion between a young woman, Artemis (a fascinating and mercurial Sofia Kokkali), and her long-estranged father Paris (Lazaros Georgakopoulos), the picture\u2019s impulsive, unfettered approach mirrors Artemis\u2019s erratic nature. Her age is not specified but, returning after a long absence to Athens because of a sudden deterioration in her father\u2019s health, Artemis seems to regress to the teenager whose relationship with him was characterised by distance and a sullen restraint on both sides. There is a space between them even now. \u201cDoes it hurt,\u201d asks Artemis, reaching towards her father\u2019s hand. But she doesn\u2019t quite touch him, her fingers hover just above his. There\u2019s a sense of remove in the way the camera is used \u2013 a whole scene is shot through the distorting lens of a magnifying glass. Later, when a physiotherapist shows Artemis how to support her father, their bodies, forced into physical contact, are rigid with discomfort.Bored, slightly rebellious and working through her own destructive issues, Artemis explores her father\u2019s space until she finally stumbles upon a secret that explains his reticence. As the enigmatic, tarot-inspired title suggests, questions remain, but Lentzou leaves us with the sense that this long-stalled relationship can finally move forward.","456":"A new film with a Paul Schrader script has to be news \u2026 but this isn\u2019t exactly new. It\u2019s a grungy, grubby and frankly dreary exploitationer in the straight-to-video mould, with a perfunctory and shallow religious motif and nasty misogynist scenes, which has actually been on the shelf since 2014, after Schrader was replaced as director by Alfonso Pineda Ulloa and Succession\u2019s Brian Cox with Ron Perlman.Mexican actor Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Yazpik (from Almod\u00f3var\u2019s I\u2019m So Excited) plays a notorious gang enforcer nicknamed the Jesuit (after the Spanish Inquisition\u2019s torture habits); he is newly released from prison in Texas and brooding on going straight when his ex-wife Nadia (Paz Vega) is murdered by her vicious new husband Vincent (Neal McDonough), who also abducts the Jesuit\u2019s son and takes him to Mexico. So the Jesuit follows this guy south on a terrifying quest for his boy, with revenge on his mind and murder in his heart, taking with him a stripper called Inez (Shannyn Sossamon) whom he met in the film\u2019s \u201csexposition\u201d scene in a lapdance club, and whom he apparently needs to pose as his wife. Tim Roth plays the Jesuit\u2019s dodgy British lawyer and he phones his performance in with a cockney-geezer accent.The film clunks on, acted with no flair or charisma by anyone in the cast and no energy or interest in the direction. A Rodriguez or a Tarantino \u2013 or, indeed, a Schrader \u2013 might have found something in the film\u2019s episodic structure and its gallery of grotesques, but, as it is, this is just leaden. There Are No Saints is released on 27 June on digital platforms.","457":"Guided by a deliberately monotonous first-person narration, French director Damien Odoul\u2019s cryptic exercise in loneliness unscrolls like a visual diary. The opening half of the film has an observational documentary style, as the camera stalks about a secluded cabin in the woods where Theo (Theo Kermel), a young man with Down\u2019s syndrome, lives with his photographer father. The line between nature and civilisation gradually erodes as the pair frequently roam around in the nude. Theo \u2013 or TO as he likes to call himself \u2013 even watches loud porn with his father sitting in the same room.When the patriarch leaves for a work trip, the film sheds its realist veneer. From its tone of deference, TO\u2019s voiceover morphs into impotent rage and resentment, as he speaks about a near biblical hatred towards his father. Forbidden desires and fantasies flare up like an unquenchable fire that annihilates any sense of stylistic as well as narrative coherence.Unfortunately, this is when the initially intriguing slice of secluded life descends into hollow indulgence. TO\u2019s somewhat amusing dream of becoming a trained samurai mutates into orientalist nonsense, as the film cooks up a porridge of Asian cultural practices that the young man wants to emulate, from jujitsu, tai chi, and Indian deities, to the Chinese philosophy of Qi.There\u2019s also a juvenile delight in provocation for provocation\u2019s sake that is simply exhausting. Repeated nude vignettes and closeups of male genitalia being played with or mutilated soon evolve from playfulness into simplistic tactics to evoke the psychosexual turmoil that takes hold of TO. All in all, the only metamorphosis worth mentioning here is the film\u2019s own transition into the kind of tiresomeness that gives arthouse cinema a bad name. Theo and the Metamorphosis is released on 24 June in cinemas.","458":"What makes this documentary about a community of transgender women in Argentina so powerful is the feeling of intimacy and closeness. Director Isabelle Solas films her subjects with sensitivity and insight \u2013 and in return they open up their lives for the camera. That said, the film doesn\u2019t exactly make it easy for audiences outside Argentina, giving virtually no explanation or context. It opens with scenes from the 2018 trial of a man convicted of stabbing to death a trans woman, Diana Sacay\u00e1n. But it takes a bit of Googling to learn her story: Sacay\u00e1n was a high-profile transgender activist murdered in 2015. The conviction of her killer was historic \u2013 the first in Argentina under laws against gender-motivated hate crimes.The film focuses on two trans women. One is veteran activist Claudia, a funny, witty force of nature who is doing her damnedest to lobby feminist groups for more trans inclusion. We see her passionately and persuasively making the case for common ground at a rally. \u201cHistory has made us invisible too, it has persecuted us, it has murdered us, humiliated us.\u201d Claudia is close to her family: her elderly mother beams with pride sitting next to her daughter.That\u2019s not the experience of other trans women in the film, who talk of being disowned by their families, pushing some into sex work. Many share their stories with Violeta, a cool and soulful anthropology researcher and trans activist, who is the film\u2019s other focus. Being trans is dangerous in Argentina; one activist points out that life expectancy is just 35 years in Latin America as a whole. In her early 50s, she is beating the odds. Still, the film ends on an optimistic note: Violeta at an exhibition celebrating trans culture and history \u2013 wall after wall of black and white images from the archive of gorgeous trans women done up to the nines. Our Bodies Are Your Battlefields is available from 22 June on Mubi.","459":"Jacqueline Lentzou\u2019s debut feature is a difficult, elusive, but ultimately rewarding study of a daughter struggling to reconnect with her father: it\u2019s a film which \u2013 initially at least \u2013 appears to occlude its own meaning with mannerisms which I associate with the absurdist style of the Greek new wave.Sofia Kokkali plays Artemis, a young woman who has been away from her Athens family for a long time, but comes home when her father, Paris, (Lazaros Georgakopoulos ) suffers a stroke, rendering him hardly able to walk and all but speechless. Somehow, the responsibility of caring for Paris falls on Artemis while her extended family interview live-in caregivers and squabble about how to proceed. Meanwhile, her mother, estranged from Paris, seems detached from the whole situation, and Artemis is faintly disquieted to be reacquainted with an affectionate family friend: Iakovos (Nikitas Tsakiroglou).It is all the more painful for Artemis because she and her father argued constantly in her teen years: the kind of confrontation which, in one agonised and faintly surreal scene, Artemis reenacts while alone in her bedroom, playing both parts, before finally collapsing in tears. The action \u2013 at first displayed through disorienting closeups and odd camera angles \u2013 is broken up with references to tarot cards and the phases of the moon, as well as old analogue video footage which Paris appears to have shot himself 20 years before with his own commentary, footage whose emotional meaning is effectively withheld until the very end of the film.There is a kind of unemphasised intensity about this movie, which makes the climactic dialogue scene between Artemis and Paris effective, although I wondered if there was not perhaps a little too much tricksiness and contrivance in the way the \u201cdiscovery\u201d was managed and the opening scenes were shot. But Kokkali persuasively enacts both the emotional hurt and emotional healing. Moon, 66 Questions is released on 24 June in cinemas.","460":"It\u2019s a sultry summer in the late 1990s and 13-year-old Grace (Niamh Walter) leaves her parents and their troubled marriage behind in London to visit Cornwall with her best friend Asta (Nyobi Hendry) and Asta\u2019s boho-cool mum Kate (Rebecca Palmer). There are woods to mess around in, plenty of time to wonder what kissing boys will be like, and long-leash supervision from Kate who lets the girls run free. Nevertheless, the every-night\u2019s-a-sleepover atmosphere is darkened by Grace\u2019s menace-suffused dreams, rabbit corpses that keep popping up out of nowhere, and a handsome but intrusive male presence in the shape of Sid (Zaqi Ismail), who comes to visit. A shy, watchful only child who is having one of those adolescent religious phases, Grace is troubled by her knowledge of dad Rupert Shelbourne\u2019s infidelity and her mother\u2019s sorrow, but has also internalised her dad\u2019s prejudice against \u201cfat girls\u201d. She looks primed to develop either an eating disorder or a drug habit, or maybe neither of the above. It\u2019s that point in a life when everything is possible.Director Alice Millar and screenwriter Isobel Boyce jointly evoke the sensuality and protean quality of 13-year-old girls, especially the delicate kittenish power struggles between friends over who is more sophisticated, but also who is more authentically a child. The period setting is especially useful here because, instead of spending all their time staring at their phones like most contemporary teens, these two are still interested in building dens in the woods. But they also want to decorate the structure with flowers: \u201cI think it\u2019s really important that it\u2019s attractive as well as functional,\u201d says Asta, clearly channelling mum Kate\u2019s sensibilities. And while the warm, sun-flare-dappled cinematography is credited to Benjamin J Murray, Millar\u2019s experience as a director of photography pays off with a strong visual identity that runs through everything, from the lighting to the warm orange hues in the costumes and production design.Less assured, however, is Millar\u2019s touch with the young actors; they struggle a bit to make the dialogue sound natural. Meanwhile, the film\u2019s ambition to evoke a sense of dread, especially with a droning, almost John Carpenter-ish sort of soundtrack, doesn\u2019t quite come off somehow, and the last act is maladroit and all over the shop. Still, it\u2019s an interesting, promising feature debut for Millar, and Walter has real star presence. Summer in the Shade is available on 20 June on digital platforms.","461":"This watchable if undeniably on-the-nose drama follows middle-aged American mother Barbara (Siobhan Fallon Hogan) on a quest for justice after her first-year student son Jimmy (Jay Jay Warren) dies at a party in his frat house after imbibing an excess of alcohol and pills. In entirely believable fashion, the son\u2019s university refuses to admit any responsibility for Jimmy\u2019s death. But Barbara is a feisty Irish-Catholic with red hair, and has an unquenchable devotion to her children \u2013 although her focus on them, especially her ill-fated eldest son, comes off a little dysfunctional in the early part of the film as she calls Jimmy incessantly to hear how his pledge week is going. After his death, and a period of mourning and housecoat wearing, she goes on a long road trip to gather information about other kids who died in hazing rituals in order to either get a news story published or put pressure on her local senator to do something about the harmful effects of these initiation ceremonies.As it enters the home stretch, viewers who haven\u2019t done their research might be thinking this film could be something based on a true story about a crusading, working-class woman defeating the weaselly educational institutions or the formidably well-funded \u201cGreek\u201d network of fraternities and sororities. But then it goes off in a whole other revenge-tragedy direction, which is kind of barmy but also much more satisfying.Few actors would have been able to pull this off like Hogan, who is not only the star but also the film\u2019s screenwriter and producer. She\u2019s one of those \u201cwho-is-that-again?\u201d character actors you\u2019ve seen hundreds of times before in all sorts of films, from Men in Black to Lars von Trier\u2019s Dogville and most recently Clifford the Big Red Dog; she is ordinary looking but also radiant, a force of nature in a fringed buckskin coat. Danish director Vibeke Muasya just rolls with it and lets Hogan steer the ship. A Mother\u2019s Fury is available on 20 June on digital platforms.","462":"To infinity \u2013 and even further back! Lightyear is a treat: a time-travelling, space-ranging, animated adventure in the spirit of classic sci-fi. It is a prequel origin-myth for the Buzz Lightyear spaceman figure from the Toy Story movies, that lantern-jawed and gung-ho astronaut sonorously voiced in the original by Tim Allen and now by Chris Evans. Lightyear might not precisely be up there with the very creamiest of the Pixar crop but it reminds you why we loved Pixar in the first place: wit, fun, storytelling and heart. It does, however, leave untouched the crucial question of whether \u201cBuzz\u201d is his given name or his nickname. I naturally spent this film waiting for someone to call him Edwin Eugene Lightyear Jr. But no.In the original films, Sheriff Woody was the cowboy toy taken from a hokey TV show called Woody\u2019s Roundup. Now it transpires that Buzz Lightyear \u2013 who once threatened Woody for dominance in the toy collection of a kid called Andy, just as sci-fi superseded the western in Hollywood myth-making \u2013 was taken from a sleek and exciting movie called Lightyear. And the opening titles explain that this is that very movie, the film that generated the merch of which Buzz was a part. It was therefore supposedly made in the early 90s, the era of the first Toy Story set in 1995. Young Andy must have had his mind blown at this film\u2019s digital effects and perhaps also by its admirably forward-thinking attitudes on LGBTQ+ representation. It also has a very startling twist. What a strain it must have been for Buzz, Woody and everyone else never to have mentioned that.Well, now we get to see Lightyear in civilian clothes and in fatigues, and often without the snugly fitting skullcap that goes under his helmet. Now we see his brown hair, cut short: the effect is to make him rather boyish and vulnerable. With his commanding officer and best friend Alisha Hawthorne (voiced by Uzo Aduba), Buzz finds himself marooned on a hostile planet when their vast mother-ship crash-lands there. The hundreds of personnel on board are ordered to make the best of things and build a temporary community in this remote place, while fearless pilot Buzz makes a series of test flights out into space to see if the hyperspeed necessary for escape is even possible.But the awful truth is that these attempts mess with the space-time continuum: after each 60-second flight, he comes back to find four years have gone past. Buzz keeps poignantly flying out, while everyone else gets older and dies off. Finally he returns to find a new generation of commanding officers who tell him they are just staying and that he must now give up on thoughts of getting away. But doughty Buzz (eerily forever young) is not to be put off and finds himself making common cause with Alisha\u2019s smart, grownup granddaughter, Izzy (voiced by Keke Palmer) and a ragtag group of volunteers. Under Buzz\u2019s command, their destiny is to confront the evil Emperor Zurg, voiced by James Brolin.Wittily, this film shows us the living scenes and personae of which the famous toys were a simplification, and it gives us new characters into the bargain: notably a robot cat companion for Buzz called Sox (voiced by Peter Sohn) who, though not especially original, adds to the film\u2019s good-natured fun. The film just bounces along, zipping through its running time. Now surely we need Pixar to give us a heart-rending Revolutionary-Road-style drama about the early married life of Mr and Mrs Potato Head. Lightyear is released on 16 June in Australia, and 17 June in the US and UK.","463":"Here is a rather self-conscious sci-fi satire, directed by Joseph Kosinski and adapted by Deadpool screenwriters Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese from George Saunders\u2019s New Yorker short story Escape from Spiderhead, published in the collection Tenth of December \u2013 which someone in this film is actually shown reading, an unbearably smug piece of brand cross-promotion.Miles Teller plays Jeff, a convict who some time in the future has been given the chance to serve his term in the relatively cushy Spiderhead unit for experimental psychology, run by the oleaginous Dr Steve Abnesti (Chris Hemsworth). Jeff is there on condition that he, like all the other specially chosen lab\u2013rat prisoners, consents to have various hi-tech drugs flooded into his system from a special unit fixed to his lower back: drugs to make him irrationally happy or sad or horny (in the company of a similarly doped prisoner), while Dr Abnesti and his increasingly unhappy assistant Verlaine (Mark Paguio) look on from behind the two-way mirror. And in a Stanford-type refinement of cruelty, Dr Abnesti will also invite Jeff back to this observation deck and monitor his undrugged reactions on being told to choose which of two prisoners behind the glass gets the \u201cpain\u201d treatment.Jeff\u2019s relationship with another prisoner Lizzy (Jurnee Smollett) will provide the movie\u2019s crisis point and we will finally discover the full truth about why Jeff is in prison after a cheatingly fudged flashback scene. There is some fetishistic interest in the way Dr Abnesti administers all these dosages from his smartphone, though this hi-tech touch makes a certain vitally important old-fashioned tatty leather-backed file-binder a little bit implausible in this brave new world. A nice, creepy performance from Hemsworth, with Teller gamely going along with the script, but having stretched out the story idea to feature-film length, the film doesn\u2019t really give the sense that it knows where it is going. Spiderhead is released on 17 June on Netflix.","464":"In 1819, deaf, old and ill, Francisco Goya moved into a house known as the Quinta del Sordo, or House of the Deaf Man, on the southern outskirts of Madrid. Removing himself from the proximity of the royal court and the political turmoil of the city, he lived here for the next four years, principally working on preparatory drawings for his ongoing series of etchings, Los disparates, or Follies, and on the cycle of murals whose 14 images have come to be known as the Black Paintings. Using oils, he painted directly on to the plaster walls, covering over a number of landscapes that already decorated them, suggesting that the images he created there were made only for himself. Neither they nor his last great series of etchings, and their accompanying drawings, emerged until some years after his death, in exile in Bordeaux in 1828.Two hundred years later, the Black Paintings remain by turns nightmarish, bitter, funny and tender. They come across as wounded, both as images and as objects. They have suffered a lot. Goya\u2019s paintings were eventually cut from the walls (some say \u201chacked\u201d, though the technique used to remove and conserve them was a skilled task) and transferred on to canvas in the mid-19th century. Paint was damaged or lost, and at least one was cut down in size.Among the most enigmatic works of his turbulent life, they now occupy a single room at Madrid\u2019s Prado museum, whose collection they entered in 1881. Why Goya painted them, and even if they were all originally painted by the artist himself; how much he revised and changed them, and how much they were further altered by early restorers \u2013 all that remains a matter of debate. There is also conjecture about his house (which got its name not from Goya, but from the previous occupant), which was demolished in 1909.A few steps away from the Black Paintings takes us 200 years into the future, to a room of similar proportions, temporarily converted into a small cinema by the French artist Philippe Parreno, where he is showing La Quinta del Sordo, a film first seen at a Goya exhibition in Switzerland last year. Now it is paired with the paintings that provide its subject. Typically of this complex artist, there is more to it. Several times a day, the lights go down and a cellist takes a seat beside the screen, reading a statement by Spanish composer Juan Manuel Artero before beginning to play.\u201cPreludes, as we know, are like a time machine,\u201d he reads, before playing a short solo composed by Artero. \u201cThey present something that has not yet happened.\u201d When Parreno\u2019s 40-minute film is over, the cellist takes up his bow a second time to play a sonata by Luigi Boccherini, an 18th-century Italian composer who had a place at the court in Madrid, and who had once been a friend of Goya\u2019s. The prelude played before the film begins is itself a variation on Boccherini. The music is, Artero says, a time machine and a mirror, like the film.Parreno\u2019s film oscillates between surface and depth, light and shadow; between sound and vision, the pictorial spaces Goya created and the walls of the rooms they originally covered. This oscillation continues, like a tilting gyroscope, between past and present. At the end of the film, we see a crossroads at dusk, street lights, a row of buildings. We hear the traffic and the screeching brakes of a local train taking a bend in the track.Parreno calls his film \u201cscience fiction\u201d. This may seem contentious, until we learn about the 3D computer model he created of the house, which included the placement of the paintings in relation to windows and doors and to one another. Parreno was then able to make an acoustic model to simulate the way sound travelled through the building, the creak of its doors, footfalls on the wood floors, light and birdsong coming in through its windows. It is a kind of speculative architecture, a ghost space.His film also employed a camera capable of shooting the Prado\u2019s own high-definition scans of Goya\u2019s images at half a million frames per second; this seems to generate a hiss, as if coming from the paintings themselves. There are further tilts and gyrations, between the paintings and our apprehension of them and the rooms they once inhabited, and the space inside a deaf man\u2019s head.How daylight fell and crossed the paintings, how shadows and murk and candlelight illuminated and obscured them as he moved about. How we saw, going from surface to depth as the fitful light raked their surfaces. How sound came and went, was heard and not heard, or how it reached Goya or was lost to the pounding in his ears and the interior squeaks and muffles in his head. The film makes us think how hearing affects sight, and how apprehending things is dependent on all our senses.Everything rests on circumstance, the times of day, the months, the seasons and the weather. For all the research, working with documents in the Prado and other material, La Quinta del Sordo cannot be anything other than impressionistic. It approaches realism, but is constantly thwarted by detail, atmosphere, the volatility of its subject. The camera roves, catching Saturn\u2019s boggling eyes as he gorges on his child. It dwells on gawping mouths, someone shouting in the ear of an old man, a hand holding scissors and an elderly couple eating. The crowds walking out of the city in the festival of San Isidro, Madrid\u2019s patron saint; a couple of men trying to beat each other to death with cudgels. There are people sitting on branches and others floating in the air, all seen fleetingly, incompletely, as the camera goes from face to face, detail to detail, hand to ear, just like a wandering eye, homing in and sliding away.The Black Paintings are filled with apparitions, classical references, with eating and anti-clerical rants, folkloric superstition and memory. Daylight through the window casts the shadows of leaves on the woman in the mantilla. The painting is incomplete and a bit of a ruin, but somehow alive, accompanied by the sound of pigeons and sparrows. Children\u2019s squabbling voices leak in, parents calling, a church bell. Everyday sounds and a subliminal choir, thunder and deep encroaching rumbles at the witches\u2019 sabbath.This could be cheesy, but it isn\u2019t. Parreno\u2019s frequent collaborator, Nicolas Becker, won an Oscar for his sound design for the movie Sound of Metal, about a heavy metal musician losing his hearing. Becker helped Parreno map the acoustics of the Quinta. His aural re-creation of the house is marvellous. We listen on headphones, and sometimes feel pressure in our ears, the roar of circulating blood. This is almost a film about deafness, with its ringing interior noise, as well as the pictorial noise of the paintings themselves.Watching Parreno\u2019s film is like moving around an unfamiliar space with a candle. The dark sometimes assumes a galactic hugeness, lit by pulsing motes and clouds of ochre-ish dust, a flight of insects and light catching the camera lens, like spectral moons, by sparks and hisses, squeaks and squeals, and ominous vague shapes that won\u2019t resolve. We only ever see things incompletely, which is how Goya\u2019s paintings also appear to us now. There\u2019s rain pattering at the window, the shadow of droplets sliding down the pane projected on to the heavy, overpainted emptiness above Goya\u2019s dog. Did its owner once stand there, but was painted out? Afterwards, returning to the Black Paintings, I\u2019m more alert to their every touch, to their silences and indeterminacy and strangeness, their hauntedness.Until 4 September at the Museo Nacional del Prado, Madrid.","465":"Tom Palmer and Tom Stourton made their names as the comedy double-act Totally Tom who went viral some years ago with their (very funny) creation High Renaissance Man, about clueless public schoolboys at uni, but their jointly scripted debut feature film, directed by Andrew Gaynord (from TV\u2019s Stath Lets Flats) is a weirdly unrelaxed dark satire.An entitled thirtysomething called Pete (played by Stourton) has spent some years abroad doing self-congratulatory \u201cgap yah\u201d charity work with refugees, but now wants to reconnect with his old gang from university, one of whom offers to host a huge birthday weekend for Pete at his colossal country estate. There Pete discovers, to his increasing paranoid dismay, that they all now seem to be giggling at him behind his back and that he is the punchline of a massive group joke that he does not understand. These upper-middle class chums of his have also invited a boozy, obnoxious local guy from the village called Harry (Dustin Demri-Burns), whom Pete has never met and doesn\u2019t like, but can\u2019t find a polite way of disinviting.It is an interesting premise, with what could be hints of Peckinpah\u2019s Straw Dogs and Haneke\u2019s Funny Games, and there is mileage in the quarterlife-crisis fear of unpopularity and losing what made you interesting in your teens and 20s. But this struck me as that kind of comedy horror in which (like much romantic comedy) the \u201ccomedy\u201d half of the equation has gone missing. The funny stuff which we know that Stourton can do is jettisoned in favour of ordinary straight acting, and the plot\u2019s big reveal feels anticlimactic and undeveloped, relating to what appear to be two separate guilty things in Pete\u2019s past, neither of which has much impact. But I still hope that Stourton and Palmer can yet bring their High Renaissance Man comedy energy to films. All My Friends Hate Me is released on 10 June in cinemas.","466":"Movie director Leo McCarey has a proposal for producer Hal Roach. He has seen Oliver Hardy and Stan Laurel acting in the same silent short, The Lucky Dog, and now he wants to see them as a double act. The film could be called Putting Pants on Philip and the comedians would play to their distinctive characteristics: Hardy as the southern gentleman, Laurel as the wiry Brit. McCarey thinks they\u2019ll be funny together.Not only that, this will be an antidote to the madcap tomfoolery of Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd and the Keystone Cops. His genius idea is for them to play it slow.This is the cue, in the late Tom McGrath\u2019s play, for a piece of choreographed slapstick. The kind of wallpaper sketch we\u2019ve all seen in panto becomes a ballet of ladders, brushes and shovels. Wordlessly, Stan and Ollie run through an extended dance of ducks, dives and crashes. Heads get bashed, ties get slashed and paste gets everywhere. Nearly a century on, the audience guffaws.In this way, McGrath\u2019s play is a paradox; it is a monument to the ephemeral. First seen in 1976, it not only celebrates the comic genius of Stan and Ollie, reprising some of their finest sketches, but also laments the passing of their moment.Written with the fluidity of a dream, it charts the biographical details, from music hall and vaudeville to cinema success, via multiple wives and misguided deals. But rather than a straight tribute, it is a wistful commentary on getting older, a reflection on the impossibility of capturing a fleeting instance of inspiration, laughter and camaraderie.Returning to the parts they last played in 2005, Stephen McNicoll and Barnaby Power are a consummate team. McNicoll, uncannily like Hardy in stature and manner, is all grace, pomposity and flourishes of the tie. Power, always deferential, captures the sleepy eyelids, lolloping gait and endless double takes of a tuft-haired Laurel.Oddly, the theme of ageing is less poignant now that the actors are closer to the ages of the comedians in their heyday. But on a monochrome set by Neil Murray on which even the pies are grey, Tony Cownie\u2019s production remains a bittersweet celebration of the silly and sublime.At the Royal Lyceum, Edinburgh, until 25 June.","467":"The price of admission, as they say, is justified by the sight of legendary German actor Udo Kier in a Dynasty-era lime-green pantsuit, heels, sunglasses, a rakishly inclined hat and a More cigarette smouldering between his lips. In another of his arrestingly unpredictable career-swerves, Kier now teeters on a knife-edge between throwaway camp humour and sentimental sorrow, playing Pat Pitsenbarger, a character based on a real-life figure from director Todd Stephens\u2019s Ohio home town.Pat is a retired hairdresser, now in a care home; he is recovering from a stroke, still alert, although secretly addicted to his cigarettes and an obsessive habit of folding paper napkins into the kind of small square shape that used to go under highball glasses in the bars where he once hung out. He is visited by a haughty lawyer, Mr Shanrock (Tom Bloom), and Pat\u2019s nurse can\u2019t believe that her patient will wish to see this man: \u201cShall I tell him you\u2019re dead?\u201d Shanrock tells Pat his late client Mrs Rita Parker Sloan (Linda Evans) \u2013 the Republican society hostess whose coiffure was nurtured by Pat every Friday afternoon \u2013 has left instructions in her will that Pat should do the hair and makeup work on her corpse before she is buried. So Pat has to reassemble his flamboyant clothing ensemble and sashay across town for this final job, his chef-d\u2019oeuvre, and make his peace with his memories of Rita\u2019s snobbery and homophobia \u2013 and also with his hairdressing rival Dee Dee Dale (Jennifer Coolidge), who stole his most famous client.There are plenty of laughs here and Kier doesn\u2019t have to work very hard to get them: he demonstrates a tremendous hauteur in the way Pat asks for various inaccessible items at the local convenience store and then like a Vegas high-roller, while other customers are impatiently lining up behind him, demands various lottery scratchcards: \u201cHit me!\u201d Like Werner Herzog, Kier\u2019s German accent lends a deadpan drollery to everything he says, but there is a gooey soft-centre to his film, and Kier carries that off reasonably well, his face becoming almost boyish. Another intriguing persona in the Udo Kier gallery. Swan Song is released on 10 June in cinemas.","468":"As unstintingly jingoistic as it is relentlessly entertaining, this Indian blockbuster celebrates a fictionalised version of the life and \u2013 as most of its audience will already know - death of heroic soldier Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan, who was killed fighting terrorists during the 2008 siege at Taj Mahal Palace hotel in Mumbai.Sandeep\u2019s story is already the stuff of legend, so this lavish production goes all-out with all the hagiographic bells and whistles, turning him into a noble, fearless warrior (played by Adivi Sesh, also the film\u2019s screenwriter). Sesh and director Sashi Kiran Tikka turn Sandeep into a very old-school sort of hero: part godlike being, part 1980s-style Hollywood action man, capable of hitting a target with a semi-automatic while sliding for metres on his knees, in slow-motion no less. He also possesses an unswerving moral compass that makes him a natural leader and compels him to honour his duty as a soldier above all else, even if that means neglecting his beautiful architect wife Isha (Saiee Manjrekar, utterly magnetic) and sometimes failing to return calls from his parents (Prakash Raj, Revathi).The first, more fictional part covers Sandeep and Isha\u2019s courtship in some detail, climaxing with a no-cliche-left-unused kiss-in-the-rain declaration of love. That strand of the story is crosscut with lots and lots of montages showing how quickly Sandeep rises up the ranks thanks to his natural proficiency until he becomes a training officer for the elite 51 Special Action Group in the National Security Guards. When the dastardly terrorists attack in Mumbai, he shouldn\u2019t have been among the soldiers who went in to save the hostages and fight back, but he insisted on going. The producers have clearly paid up for the extras, sets and visual effects making this a lavish work, never dull for a second of its ample running time \u2013 even if some viewers may find the sentimentality a little hard to digest. Major is released on 3 June in cinemas. This article was amended on 3 June 2022 to remove mention of Bollywood, as the film was produced by India\u2019s Telegu film industry.","469":"Here is a feature-length selection of documentary shorts from Britain\u2019s pioneering women film-makers from the 1930s to the 1960s \u2013 a theatrical \u201ctouring version\u201d from the Independent Cinema Office, taken from a larger assortment on the BFI\u2019s two-disc DVD release.The directors are very often tackling what were considered \u2013 by the male producers, that is \u2013 to be the \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d of the day: motherhood, family, hearth and home. Sometimes these are the explicit themes and sometimes they are a subtext. Two of the films are prefaced with content warnings about racism (though not sexism): a blackface minstrel show in Broadstairs is shown in one film and, in another on obstetric education for working-class women, someone is shown repeating the extraordinary superstition that drinking stout will \u201cgive you a black baby\u201d \u2013 although, unlike the minstrels, this is clearly signposted in the film itself as bizarre and wrong.Beside the Seaside (1935) by Marion Grierson, sister of John Grierson, is a sprightly, ambient evocation of the prewar seaside holiday, regarded without criticism or irony as a healthy restorative tradition. There\u2019s a little of Jean Vigo\u2019s \u00c0 Propos de Nice in it. Another Grierson sister, Ruby, directed the drama-doc They Also Serve (1940), a paean to the home-front wives and mothers whose husbands were away in uniform, or perhaps too old for service. Quite a few of these films show, with unintentional poignancy, how stressed and prematurely aged the women had become. That is partly true of Birth-Day (1945), directed by Brigid Cooper and Mary Beales, about how working-class women of Scotland should speak to the soothing and reassuring professionals at the antenatal clinic. And it\u2019s certainly true of Kay Mander\u2019s Homes for the People (1945), a much brisker and less patronising work about the need for proper housing.The selection finishes with the aspirational and slightly baffling Something Nice to Eat (1967), directed by Sarah Erulkar, sponsored by the Gas Board, with input from the Sunday Times magazine, evangelising for an ambitious kind of cooking inspired by the classy French. The film is a bit insufferable once it becomes clear that it is entirely addressed to ladies, and there is a curious section praising the ultra-modern kitchen. The one shown here comes with a lava lamp \u2013 great, for those who can afford it. The Camera Is Ours is released on 3 June in cinemas.","470":"Nasty, brutish and mercifully short, but occasionally mildly amusing, Dashcam represents another dollop of pandemic-themed shock schlock from writer-director Rob Savage, recently renowned for his lockdown-set horror pic Host. This time around, Savage has exchanged Host\u2019s Zoom-chat framing device for a Discord stream, with comments and emojis scrolling up from the bottom of the screen as a fictional audience reacts to the main content. This will probably need a lot of explaining to viewers in 20 years\u2019 time, but for now it seems very \u00e0 la mode and down with the kids, as is the blurry gore-soaked violence, smutty material (get ready for lots of jokes about anal insertions) and air of cynicism.The star of the show is Annie Hardy, a social media star apparently playing a version of her IRL self: she is an intentionally abrasive millennial Maga fan, whose usual gig is driving around Los Angeles livestreaming and improvising raps in response to suggestions from her fanbase. Unfortunately, lockdown has thinned the action on the streets, apart from the odd naked cyclist. So Annie flies over to the UK to visit her old friend and former bandmate Stretch (Amar Chadha-Patel), who in the years since he\u2019s seen Annie last has got less amused by her racism and refusal to conform by, for instance, wearing a mask around others. Hardy is a personification of everything that is obnoxious about the American right, but seemingly about as unkillable as a cockroach or Donald Trump\u2019s political career judging by the way she navigates through a zombie apocalypse that starts out of nowhere.Savage melds the conventions of found-footage horror and livestreaming effectively up to a certain point until it just starts to seem like a silly, contrived gag. Shot largely on iPhones, there\u2019s a huge amount of shaky-cam jiggling about that may leave some viewers feeling as if they are on one of the funfair dodgem rides featured in the final act. Others may have already begun to feel nauseous at an earlier point when the closeups of a faeces-smeared anus started up. Either way, it\u2019s not pretty. Dashcam is released on 3 June in cinemas, and on 6 June on digital platforms.","471":"That\u2019s Zlatan as in Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107, the superstar Swedish striker whose troubled childhood in a tough working-class neighbourhood of Malm\u00f6 is dramatised here. The cocky underprivileged kid saved from (possibly) a life of crime by football; it sounds like the cheesiest sports movie ever. And yet director Jens Sj\u00f6gren, more interested in what happens off the pitch, dodges the dull cliches. His sympathetic, realist film is a compelling watch.The film is based on Ibrahimovi\u0107\u2019s autobiography, co-authored with the Swedish writer David Lagercrantz. Dominic Andersson Bajraktati plays 11-year-old Zlatan, who is disruptive in school and bad-tempered on the pitch. What soon becomes clear is that all this behaviour is the communication of a kid who feels inadequate, alone and often hungry. He\u2019s playing football with middle-class boys who wear the right football boots, their dads cheering from the sidelines. Zlatan\u2019s parents divorced when he was little. His dad, Bosnian caretaker \u0160efik (Cedomir Glisovic), is a brooder who drinks heavily, and his exhausted mum Jurka (Merima Dizdarevic) is emotionally unavailable; both characters are written with real emotional generosity.Granit Rushiti is Zlatan aged 17 during a crucial moment when he might make the Malm\u00f6 first team or quit football altogether. Rushiti also plays Zlatan a few years on, in his early 20s, now a promising young striker for Ajax \u2013 where racist news reporting refers to him as a \u201clazy immigrant\u201d. There are some insightful insider-y scenes as his agent negotiates a big-time deal with Juventus.What works best is that I Am Zlatan doesn\u2019t push the triumph-over-adversity sports-movie formula. What keeps Ibrahimovi\u0107 on the straight and narrow? Survival instinct? His passion and God-given talent? The film entertains a darker possibility that he channelled his anger, that football success meant revenge against those who wrote him off. I Am Zlatan is released on 3 June in cinemas and on 20 June on digital platforms.","472":"Albert Serra\u2019s bizarre epic is a cheese-dream of French imperial tristesse, political paranoia and an apocalyptic despair. It is a nightmare that moves as slowly and confidently as a somnambulist, and its pace, length, and Serra\u2019s beautiful widescreen panoramic framings \u2013 in which conventional drama is almost camouflaged or lost \u2013 may divide opinion. I can only say I was captivated by the film and its stealthy evocation of pure evil.Admirers of Serra\u2019s previous movies The Death of Louis XIV and Libert\u00e9 will know what an uncompromisingly original and startling film-maker he is. That distinctiveness is certainly on display with this new spectacle, but with intriguing new hints of David Lynch and Nicolas Winding Refn. (Refn famously directed Agatha Christie\u2019s Marple on British TV; perhaps Albert Serra will turn out to have done some uncredited work on Death In Paradise.) The setting is Tahiti, part of French Polynesia and thus part of the French republic; its lush coasts and landscapes are evoked with breathtaking flair, yet with something lowering in their beauty, something sinister imposed upon them from above or a haze they have had to generate from below.Beno\u00eet Magimel (who seems to be morphing into G\u00e9rard Depardieu before our very eyes) is M de Roller, the French high commissioner who strolls around with raffish entitlement in his rumpled white suit, a breezy sleazy fellow who enjoys patronising all ranks of the Tahiti population. He hangs out at the local club owned by Morton, another white expatriate, played by the reliably unsettling Sergi L\u00f3pez, and De Roller grinningly ogles the almost naked bar staff and glad-hands all the other seedy officials there. He also loves hanging out with the semi-clad indigenous dancers who perform traditional dances for the tourists and, like a poundshop Paul Gauguin, fancies himself a connoisseur of their traditions. He has also fallen in love with the dancers\u2019 choreographer Shannah (Pahoa Mahagafanau).But De Roller\u2019s mood has become more cynical and dyspeptic as his term of office reaches its end, and he is disconcerted by new developments on the island. There seem to be more and more military personnel around, including a certain admiral (Marc Susini), who, when drunk, tells people at the club about the importance of behaving ruthlessly with one\u2019s \u201cown people\u201d (which constitutionally includes Tahitians) to scare potential enemies. De Roller chairs an excruciatingly difficult meeting with indigenous representatives who demand to know if there is any truth in the rumour that the French government is preparing to resume nuclear testing on the island (which, notoriously, took place in secret from the 60s to the 90s.) De Roller, in a cheerfully evasive style, which reminded me of a certain British politician, tells them what they want to hear, and finishes with what he imagines to be a charming bit of patriotic whimsy: promising that they would be welcome at the new casino being built, where Bastille Day would be duly celebrated every year.But in his heart, De Roller knows that this personal Eden of his is about to become poisoned, and perhaps that poison of political bad faith has always been there. A Portuguese diplomat (Alexandre Melo) arrives on the island, making a fuss about his lost passport, and then temporarily loses consciousness, perhaps drugged; was he secretly investigating the French nuclear project? Either way, Shannah takes it on herself to nurse him, a terrible blow to De Roller\u2019s amour propre. And, are the committee of anti-nuclear protesters, De Roller wonders, being sponsored by France\u2019s nuclear rivals: the Russians, the Americans, the Chinese?As the neurosis and horror roll in like invisible fog, De Roller takes a final tour of his beloved, yet also hated, colonial possession. There are superbly composed scenes: particularly shots of the large crafts that take parties of surfers out to where the rolling breakers come in far from shore and these big lumbering boats take on staggeringly high waves: a truly surreal spectacle. The final scenes show De Roller preparing to leave the inferno in a balletically silent and unearthly sequence. But will he actually leave?Perhaps Pacifiction is flawed, but its waywardness is part of Serra\u2019s authorship: it is an authentic descent into darkness. Pacifiction screened at the Cannes film festival and is released in UK cinemas on 21 April.","473":"Mario Martone\u2019s beautifully shot and superbly composed film teeters on the edge of something special. And if it doesn\u2019t quite achieve that, settling in the end for something more generically crime-oriented, it\u2019s still very good. Naples looks wonderful here, although very different from the city that Paolo Sorrentino depicted in The Hand of God. A middle-aged guy comes back to his home town after 40 years away, arriving on a plane from Cairo: this is Felice, played by the craggily expressive Pierfrancesco Favino. A great deal of the film\u2019s opening movement is just Felice walking around, overwhelmed with bittersweet memories that he cannot put into words: the streets, the stores, the churches, the balconies, the kids. (The film uses silent Super 8 flashbacks to make explicit some of what he\u2019s remembering.)Felice makes an emotional visit to his ageing mother, Teresa \u2013 a delectably sad portrayal from Aurora Quattrocchi \u2013 and is angry to see that she has sold the apartment he grew up in and has moved to a dingy ground-floor flat in what he suspects was a ruinous deal. But mother and son are deeply moved to see each other again and there is a touching scene when Felice takes her tiny naked body in his arms and bathes her.But there is a hidden wound beneath all this. Felice\u2019s boyhood friend Oreste (Tommaso Ragno), with whom he indulged in petty crime back in the day, is now a much-feared dead-eyed local mobster, and clearly has something to do with Felice leaving his beloved Naples in the first place. Don Luigi, the local priest, played by Francesco Di Leva, is a passionate campaigner against Oreste\u2019s murderous gangsterism, and after reacting angrily to Felice\u2019s secular \u201cconfession\u201d that he was this notorious figure\u2019s best friend, begins a subtle plan to flush Oreste out. This involves introducing Felice to all his parishioners (thus inciting the gossip that will get back to Oreste) and even encouraging the non-drinking Felice to take a little wine.Nostalgia is tremendously shot, and terrifically acted by Favino. It challenges the idea of \u201cnostalgia\u201d as broadcast in the title: it isn\u2019t simply that nostalgia is delusional, or that the past wasn\u2019t as great as it appears when viewed through rose-tinted spectacles. It is that there is no past and present. Naples then and Naples now are the same \u2013 and for Felice his fears and loves never really went away or even changed that much. A strong, deeply felt, valuable movie. Nostalgia screened at the Cannes film festival and is released on 17 February in UK cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema.","474":"A heavy tropical raincloud of sensual languor and political intrigue looms over this interesting if sometimes uncertainly acted movie from director Claire Denis \u2013 and incidentally, casting Benny Safdie in a small role is to risk everyone else getting upstaged, and so it proves here.This film touches on her keynote themes of sexuality and colonialism, in its 21st-century manifestation, though maybe the romantic passion and duplicity don\u2019t come across as strongly as they might have done with leads who had a stronger chemistry.Denis has co-adapted the 1986 novel by Denis Johnson, originally set in Nicaragua during the Sandinista revolution of the early 80s but here updated to the Covid period, the pandemic evidently fulfilling the \u201clife-during-wartime\u201d background function, although this is necessarily far less dramatic and explicit and Denis substitutes the eerie emptiness of the streets as a kind of military curfew. It is certainly more intimate than a film like The Year of Living Dangerously (1982), often more resembling an erotic hotel-room chamber piece.Margaret Qualley plays Trish, who has come to the capital, Managua, as a freelance journalist but infuriates her sometime editor back in the US (a nice Zoom cameo for John C Reilly) by being utterly useless and unreliable. She is unable to get any lifestyle\/travel articles off the ground and a rash political piece criticising corruption has earned her the loathing of the authorities. Now she is reduced to hanging around luxury hotel bars, selling sex for US dollars. She is also having a sordid affair with a local cop (Nick Romano) in return for her continued press corps privileges and with an ageing government official who has offered help.Trish meets a mysterious, handsome Englishman in the bar one evening. Daniel (Joe Alwyn) claims to be in the energy business and engages her services for the evening. Trish later sees Daniel in the company of a certain local who has told Daniel he needs his professional help. But Trish \u2013 wily and streetsmart in ways that Daniel isn\u2019t \u2013 tells Daniel this man is clearly a Costa Rican cop working for a government agency making common cause with the CIA against what Uncle Sam sees as an unhelpful nation state. Soon, this man is after Daniel\u2019s head. Daniel, too, is not what he seems and as their danger increases, Trish and Daniel embark on a passionate affair.It is reasonably acted, although the cool, enigmatic sophistication required of Alwyn brings him worryingly close to Roger Moore territory. Qualley nicely conveys neediness, alcoholism and self-reproach although her performance, like Alwyn\u2019s, sometimes feels a bit callow. They are outclassed by Safdie as the mysterious US expat who befriends Trisha.What works better is the ambient mood of torpor, cynicism and bad faith in the insupportable heat \u2013 all shrewdly conjured by Denis. Stars at Noon screened at the Cannes film festival and is released on 19 June in the UK on digital platforms.","475":"Iranian film-maker Saeed Roustayi delivers a big, absorbing, character-driven family drama in the Italian-American style with fierce performances, a huge set-piece wedding scene and touches of Visconti\u2019s Rocco and His Brothers and Coppola\u2019s The Godfather. There\u2019s even some Arthur Miller amid the angry, painful recrimination.We get a blistering turn from Taraneh Alidoosti \u2013 known for her work on movies by Asghar Farhadi \u2013 playing the Leila of the title: a woman driven to distraction by the indolent, incompetent patriarchy. Leila lives with her elderly parents; she is plagued with periodic back pain brought on by stress and overwork and is basically the only regular wage-earner, single-handedly supporting four adult brothers.Overweight Parviz (Farhad Aslani) works as a toilet cleaner in the mall, but does not make enough to feed his family, which grows as he tries repeatedly for a boy. Musclebound lunk Farhad (Mohammad Ali Mohammadi) is interested only in US wrestling on TV. Bone-idle Manouchehr (Payman Maadi) is looking for dodgy get-rich-quick schemes, not work. And Alireza (Navid Mohammadzadeh) recently quit a factory job whose bosses weren\u2019t coming through with the wages.At the head of all these useless, parasitical males is their ageing father, Esmail (Saeed Poursamimi) \u2013 a whining, self-pitying schemer, addicted to opium, and obsessed with becoming \u201cpatriarch\u201d of his extended clan, a position that has fallen vacant with his cousin\u2019s death. The cousin\u2019s son Bayram (Mehdi Hosseinina) tells him the patriarch\u2019s metaphorical crown could be his \u2013 as long as he pays 40 gold coins as a marriage present \u201ctribute\u201d at Bayram\u2019s son\u2019s forthcoming wedding. Greedy, foolish Esmail agrees \u2013 because he has the coins and knows that the patriarch\u2019s unofficial perk is taking a secret \u201ccut\u201d from any and all marriage gifts at future weddings.Meanwhile, Leila has latched on to an imaginative plan which could yet make the family an honest income: they could take the lease on one of the new retail units being built at the mall, symbolically on the site of Parviz\u2019s public lavatory. But she can only get the bank loan with a deposit \u2013 she needs cash \u2013 and is enraged to learn that the old man\u2019s stash of gold coins is going to be squandered in this fatuous, dishonest way. But can he be stopped?Leila lives in a world of male crooks who never cease congratulating themselves on their status and prestige, yet are averse to anything resembling work and entirely content to leech off the women, rewarding them with misogyny and condescension. The cynical crook Manouchehr had suggested to his brothers a business meeting with a pal \u2013 Leila was naturally excluded from the meeting, as a woman. This opportunity turned out to be merely a scam to lease nonexistent cars, similar in its underhandedness to the patriarch\u2019s \u201cwedding gift\u201d trick. And as with that trick, it is extremely likely that the person letting you in on the secret is making you the biggest victim.Leila\u2019s simmering rage at the contemptible mediocrity of her father and brothers, and the exhaustion of trying to save them from themselves, is the emotional energy that powers the movie, building to that climactic wedding scene. It is a great performance from Alidoosti, first among equals in a great ensemble cast. Leila\u2019s Brothers screened at the Cannes film festival.","476":"The Coen brothers temporarily parted ways for solo projects on haunted charismatic wrongdoers: for Joel it was Macbeth, for Ethan it has turned about to be insurgent rock\u2019n\u2019roll legend Jerry Lee Lewis, the shuddering, quivering Pentecostal shaman of the devil\u2019s music, who is still alive at the age of 86.Coen has put together a thoroughly enjoyable documentary composed entirely of archive footage of Jerry Lee throughout the years and his interviews and performances, starting with his sensational beginnings in the 1950s, leading to his cancellation in 1957 on the grounds of getting married \u2013 of all the sweetly old-fashioned things \u2013 to his 13-year-old cousin Myra Gale Brown. With cheerful impenitence, Jerry Lee is shown correcting an interviewer: Myra was one day shy of her 13th birthday on their wedding day so she was actually twelve.Long years in the touring wilderness followed, doggedly tending to his US fanbase coast-to-coast, before Jerry Lee cunningly and successfully reinvented himself as a country singer, and an extravagantly sincere gospel performer: personalities which co-existed with multiple marriages and drink and drug abuse issues.In the amazing 50s footage Jerry Lee looks like the most terrifying Batman villain: the Riddler, perhaps, with his unfurled ringlets of blond hair that flew back from his head as he clattered the notes with those straight, splayed fingers for Whole Lotta Shakin\u2019 Goin\u2019 On, kicked the stool back and crashed a dissonant heel down on the keyboard. In his later, country incarnation in the 70s with more measured style and subdued hair, Jerry Lee is shown performing Whole Lotta Shakin\u2019 again, and it sounds even more predatory. No one made the line \u201cwe got chicken in the barn\u201d sound more horribly unwholesome. He would still periodically go into the weird marionette playing style, bending his forearms up at the elbow, alternating to bring his fists down.Like Elvis and all white rock\u2019n\u2019roll legends, Jerry Lee had an unpayable debt to black music and great black performers like Little Richard; Coen doesn\u2019t mention it, but there\u2019s also an obvious link between Jerry Lee and Liberace, the same weirdly coy up-through-the-lashes glance at the audience that\u2019s created when you look at them from the keyboard. Elvis\u2019s instruments were the mic stand and the guitar, which lend themselves more directly to pelvis-gyrating sexiness. With the piano it\u2019s different - you have to launch yourself crazily away from it, as if moved by the spirit.Jerry Lee always looked like a carnival barker and a televangelist - much more so than his cousin Jimmy Swaggart, who actually was a televangelist. He looks completely different for a BBC TV interview he gave to my colleague Richard Williams on The Old Grey Whistle Test: Jerry Lee had a beard, because he was preparing to play Jesus in a planned movie called The Carpenter. Sadly, I can find no record of that film ever getting made - what a remarkable performance Jerry Lee would surely have given. There is also a fascinating audio recording of a conversation Jerry Lee had with Sun Records founder Sam Phillips, in which confessed his agonising fears about the state of his immortal soul.This documentary does something very few films can: it makes you grin with pleasure. Jerry Lee Lewis: Trouble in Mind screened at the Cannes film festival.","477":"Endless drama, perpetual pouting and nonstop narcissism in this epically tiresome movie from director Valerie Bruni-Tedeschi and screenwriter Agnes De Sacy about a generation of highly-strung and mercurially talented young drama students in the 1980s who are admitted to the prestigious acting school at Patrice Ch\u00e9reau\u2019s Theatre Des Amandiers in Nanterre.Among the ranks of yearning and deeply serious hopefuls, Stella (Nadia Tereszkiewicz) is a passionate blonde star who is sort of embarrassed about the hugely wealthy home she comes from; Ad\u00e8le (Clara Bretheau) is the rebellious, wacky figure who doesn\u2019t wear knickers at the audition; Victor (Vassily Schneider) is a sweet-natured, klutzy boy; \u00c9tienne (Sofiane Bennacer) is the smack-addicted guy who starts going out with Stella, and his moody image and habit of shouting \u201cStella!\u201d earn him the nickname Marlon Brando \u2014 the film\u2019s one genuinely humorous moment.The drama teacher Pierre Romans is played by Micha Lescot, and the legendary Ch\u00e9reau is played with much smouldering imperious charisma by Louis Garrel.This is a strange, overwrought setup, though perhaps quite accurately drawn, in which the students are in a permanent state of emotional meltdown. \u00c9tienne introduces his teacher Pierre to smack and the supposed authority figure gets completely out of it in the middle of a rehearsal. As for Ch\u00e9reau himself, he is a huge cocaine enthusiast, and is shown snorting a massive line in the middle of the working day. The fact that all these students are sleeping with each other means that news of an HIV positive diagnosis creates a great spasm of shrieking anxiety and three of them are shown cramming into a single phone box to get the news of an Aids test. But this whole subject is treated with far less seriousness than a movie like, say, Robin Campillo\u2019s 120 BPM and these young people don\u2019t really appear to care about anything or anyone other than themselves.With a subject like this, the shadow of Alan Parker\u2019s Fame is never far away, and it is maybe too easy to mock. But what is exasperating about the film is its reluctance to dramatise the teaching: to show the young people themselves simply getting better at acting. They are doing a performance of Chekhov\u2019s Platonov, one of whose themes is the fragility and impermanence of youth. But their relationship to Chekhov is not taken seriously: the play simply provides incidental scenes and a backdrop to the silly, soap-operatic uproar.","478":"In this rowdy cop-movie pastiche from Iceland, a hot shot detective is partnered with his arch rival, only to find that their mutual animosity is a mask for deeper feelings. A heady mix of muscle cars, bank robberies, shootouts and macho posturing is juxtaposed with a polite Icelandic backdrop and a touching (if not entirely persuasive) gay love story.Cop Secret is a broadly comic feature debut from Hannes \u00de\u00f3r Halld\u00f3rsson (who in a previous life was goalkeeper in the Icelandic national football team), but one that is too exhaustingly blunt to be as funny as it clearly believes itself to be. On digital platforms","479":"There has been a wealth of exceptional music documentaries lately \u2013 the kind of films that are strong enough to connect with both fans and audiences who are indifferent to the music of their subjects. Unfortunately, a-ha: The Movie is not one of these. The story of the unfathomably pretty 80s Norwegian pop trio is recounted in dour, exacting detail by three men who make no secret of how little love is lost between them. The iconic animated video for Take On Me is referenced \u2013 one of the more appealing aspects of the film is the way it also uses animation to illustrate tales of the bandmates\u2019 early lives.Fans will no doubt find the film fascinating, if a little dispiriting: it may be like eavesdropping on your parents, only to discover that they\u2019re on the brink of divorce.","480":"A Norwegian housing estate becomes the village of the damned in this icily brilliant supernatural tale from film-maker Eskil Vogt, who as a screenwriter is known for his collaborations with Joachim Trier; rather amazingly, his movie before this brutal chiller was their co-scripted romantic comedy The Worst Person in the World. As for The Innocents, it might yet become a scary-movie classic: it greased my palms with anxiety and incidentally has some of the best child acting I have ever seen. See it now before Hollywood comes along and messes up your perception with a dodgy remake. (Having said which, Steven Spielberg or Brian De Palma might well have been interested in this script in their younger days, or maybe even now.)Vogt places us in a pleasant, if featureless residential development in Roms\u00e5s, Oslo, with 60s-style high-rise buildings near an artificial lake and picturesque woodland. Ida (played by newcomer Rakel Lenora Fl\u00f8ttum) is a moody nine-year-old who resents her mum and dad paying so much attention to her elder sister Anna (Alva Brynsmo Ramstad), who is autistic. As the long hot summer drags on, Ida is left to play outside, and tasked with looking after Anna. But Ida leaves her sister alone on the swings one day while she goes off with a new friend: a boy called Ben (Sam Ashraf) who shows her a strange mental trick he can do, making a bottle cap fly through the air without touching it. He also has a nasty predilection for torturing animals.Meanwhile, Anna strikes up a friendship with a girl called Aisha (Mina Yasmin Bremseth Asheim), who has telepathic powers to match Ben\u2019s telekinesis. Aisha starts silently communicating in her mind with Anna, who \u2013 to her parents\u2019 overjoyed astonishment \u2013 is now able to speak, thanks to her new friend. But these superpowers, revealed as calmly and frankly as if in some social-realist drama, become forces for evil.There is something compelling and even shocking about Ida\u2019s first reaction to Ben\u2019s bottle-cap trick: her sudden, fierce grin of pleasure and excitement. It is almost unearthly. These children are not innocent, and yet there is something pristine in their seclusion from adulthood; like the children in this film\u2019s namesake from 1961, based on Henry James\u2019s ghost story The Turn of the Screw, their world is a secret from the grownups. I also found myself thinking of English TV dramatist Dennis Potter.With a story such as this, it is tempting to find it legible only as metaphor: to decide that Ida, Anna, Ben and Aisha\u2019s existence is a parable for abuse, family dysfunction or racism (it is the two young people of colour who have the powers, at least initially.) Vogt\u2019s script for Trier\u2019s 2017 film Thelma, with its telekinesis theme, is obviously amenable to metaphorical readings. But perhaps this film\u2019s force comes from the fact that there is no other level to find in it. They simply have these supernatural abilities, it is something to do with their being children, and that is all there is to it. The final \u201cduel\u201d scene, taking place in almost complete silence and under the nose of the notionally competent adults, is a masterpiece of sorts. The Innocents is a nightmare unfolding in cold, clear daylight. The Innocents is released on 20 May in cinemas and on digital platforms.","481":"It\u2019s got to be one of the worst jobs in showbiz: being a-ha\u2019s official photographer. Here\u2019s the poor guy after a particularly awkward, everyone-gritting-their-teeth photo shoot: \u201cIt\u2019s very hard as a photographer when people don\u2019t want to be together. It shows.\u201d And it really does show. Watching this 40th-anniversary documentary, you might conclude that what a-ha really need is a band therapist, not a photographer.Four years in the making, a-ha: The Movie is the comprehensive story of the Norwegian trio (about 20 minutes too comprehensive for all but diehard fans). To anyone over 45, no introductions are necessary: a-ha is the band whose single Take on Me reached No 2 in the UK charts back in 1985 (it\u2019s still a knockout pop tune with the crack-cocaine of riffs). Back then, the band\u2019s singer Morten Harket smouldered like a sensitive misunderstood bad boy. Now he looks like the dishy doctor from a daytime soap, still impossibly chiselled. Like all the band, Harket has got his personal demons: he\u2019s a perfectionist who instantly reaches for the hand sanitiser after meeting fans (this was filmed pre-Covid, apparently). Keyboardist Magne Furuholmen still resents being booted off guitar back in the 80s. Guitarist P\u00e5l Waaktaar-Savoy is a controlling presence.The history that emerges here is of a band yo-yoing between attempts to be taken seriously as artists, then coming back for more boyband fame and adulation. An air of collective self-loathing and regret hangs over them. Of course, it\u2019s impossible to feel that sorry for three wealthy men in middle age swanning around the world on sold-out tours wearing leather jackets that cost the price of a second-hand car. Waaktaar-Savoy\u2019s wife puts it best when she says it\u2019s a shame they can\u2019t enjoy it more. \u201cIt\u2019s sinful not to appreciate what you have when you have so much.\u201d a-ha: The Movie is released on 20 May in cinemas.","482":"Let\u2019s do the wacky metafictional zombie film right here! That is the rationale behind this unassuming knockabout comedy-farce - in which more or less everyone gets splattered with blood and bodily fluids - from Michel Hazanavicius, chosen to open this year\u2019s Cannes film festival, and so starting things off with some easygoing laughs. (A very bizarre experience, considering that audiences at the opening gala had just watched a live video-link address from Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Zelenskiy, however, is a comedy veteran in his former TV showbusiness career - and might well approve.)This is in fact a remake of the cult Japanese movie One Cut of the Dead by Shin\u2019ichir\u00f4 Ueda, from 2017, and this remake is itself therefore about a remake, thus adding another metafictional level to the proceedings. The result is something appreciably sillier and more eccentric than the original, with some gags about patronising and stereotypical European attitudes to the Japanese which make it broader still, and sometimes it\u2019s a tiny bit self-conscious in unintentional ways. It\u2019s certainly far from the sophistication and gloss for which Hazanavicius became famous ten years ago with his silent pastiche The Artist; it\u2019s closer to his spy spoof series OSS 117. But it\u2019s likeable and goofy.Just as with the original film, it\u2019s impossible not to think about the classic Michael Frayn meta-farce for the stage, Noises Off, showing in its first act a cheesy and chaotic rep play, then the backstage action in real-time explaining that the disasters we just witnessed. At first, the film appears to be about the making of a low-budget French zombie movie, which is interrupted by real zombies, brought back from the dead because the film crew has infringed an ancient local taboo. These real zombies delight the screamingly dictatorial director (Romain Duris) who wants authentic horror to galvanise his torpid cast. But his crew are horrified, particularly his assistant (B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo). But wait. Why do these French people have Japanese names? Why is the acting so strange, and what\u2019s with the final wobbly crane shot?The answer is that this is supposed to be a continuous single-take movie lasting just 30 minutes, being filmed on the lowest budget imaginable: any mistakes, and they can\u2019t just go back to first positions. They just have to improv it out. And once the curtain is lowered in this curious spectacle, flashbacks show us the bizarre compromises and negotiations that led up to this highly unlikely situation.It\u2019s an entertaining piece of work - and a genuine oddity, ostensibly about cinema, but more about the live theatre experience. It may yet have found a way to breathe new life into the zombie genre itself. Final Cut screened at the Cannes film festival and is released in the UK on 7 November on digital platforms.","483":"Karim A\u00efnouz, best known for mostly Brazil-set dramatic features such as Invisible Life, Love for Sale and the evocatively titled I Travel Because I Have to, I Come Back Because I Love You, is truly an international film-maker. The son of a Brazilian mother and an Algerian father, he lives sometimes in Berlin and sometimes in the US, depending on his latest project. (His next film, Firebrand, will star Alicia Vikander as Henry VIII\u2019s last wife Katherine Parr.)Mariner of the Mountains, which premiered last year at Cannes, goes back to basics technically and A\u00efnouz\u2019s own family history to create a thoughtful, often moving essay film about his journey to Algeria, the fatherland he never knew. Narrated throughout in Portuguese by the silky-voiced director, the film comprises a sort of filial love letter to his recently deceased mother, Iracema, who brought him up in Fortaleza, northern Brazil, with his grandmother after she was separated from her husband, Majid, Karim\u2019s Algerian father. Majid went to Algeria to fight in the civil war, leaving his wife pregnant back in the Americas.In the film, A\u00efnouz meets disaffected youth smoking blunts by the waterside, kindly old folk who offer him coffee and oral history, a bright teenage cousin who reels off local creation myths, and an especially beautiful goat with curly wurly horns. The imagery mixes the scenic footage A\u00efnouz shot himself along the way, intermingled with old Super 8 footage of Iracema as a young woman, archive footage and bewitching microscope views of the single-celled sea creatures the director\u2019s mother studied as a scientist.Adding the film\u2019s dreamy vibe is the editing by Ricardo Saraiva, which repeatedly builds up an atmosphere in a montage with some lovely music bedded under it only to abruptly cut, killing the buzz each time. It\u2019s as if the film wants to keep pulling the rug out from under us, just when we might be thinking we\u2019re in for a bit of brainy cinematic tourism. But A\u00efnouz is no sentimentalist; his essay invokes not just the mysteries of his parents\u2019 marriage but the country\u2019s postcolonial history and anguished present, a subject that he explored further in Nardjes A, a companion piece to this that he shot concurrently and follows a local activist fighting for democracy. Mariner of the Mountains is on Mubi from 23 May.","484":"Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, said Freud. But darlings, let me tell you \u2013 a snake is never just a snake. And certainly not in The Essex Serpent (Apple TV+), the new six part miniseries adapted by Anna Symon from Sarah Perry\u2019s 2016 bestselling novel of the same name.At the tail end of the Victorian era and recently liberated by her wealthy, abusive husband\u2019s death from cancer, young widow Cora Seaborne (Claire Danes) abandons London society and moves to Aldwinter on the edge of the Blackwater marshes to pursue a much more fulfilling life as an amateur paleontologist in comfortable clothes. With her she takes her devoted maidservant Martha (Hayley Squires) and her autistic (in modern day terms) son Frankie. Her husband\u2019s former doctor, Luke Garrett (Frank Dillane), becomes a friend \u2013 and, in time, a contender at least in his eyes for her affections \u2013 and visits often.When sightings of the legendary monster of the marshes begin, Cora theorises that it may be a living fossil \u2013 an icthyosaur-like being that escaped evolutionary pressures in the ancient wetlands \u2013 while the locals cleave to superstition and supernatural explanations for what they call \u201cthe Blackwater Beast\u201d. Between the two stands the Rev Will Ransome (Tom Hiddleston), a man of God but also of the Enlightenment, keen to keep the growing fears and fancies of his flock under control and not call on divine or diabolic explanation unless all others have been exhausted. In this, he is not helped by his curate Matthew, a fire and brimstone type (whose name is surely meant to evoke the Witchfinder General Matthew Hopkins, who began his career in Essex in the 17th century) who sees the serpent as a sign from God that urgent repentance of the villagers\u2019 sins is needed.As the friendship between Will, his ailing wife Stella (Cl\u00e9mence Poesy) and Cora grows, so does the attraction between Will and Cora \u2013 rather less convincingly on screen than in the book. Perhaps this is down to a lack of chemistry between the leads, or perhaps the miscasting of Hiddleston, who never manages to shed his innate air of suave confidence. It works well when playing a god of mischief amidst a plethora of equally towering egos in the Marvel Cinematic Universe; less so when playing a Victorian vicar humble enough to admit doubts and wrestle with his conscience. Let alone fall in love with a woman cleverer than him, and spend time offering explanations that he is too honest to dismiss out of hand, however much they pain him. It gives his exchanges with Cora a condescending edge that is the death knell to the love and profound yearning that animated their relationship in the novel.Danes, on the other hand, is magnificent as Cora \u2013 brusque, athletic, undisguisably intelligent and every inch a woman gradually being restored to life and self in the wake of her husband\u2019s brutality. In fact, all the women are wonderful, from Squires, who brings vitality and conviction to what could be the slightly worthy part of the Socialist servant eager to bring about change, via Lily-Rose Aslandogdu and Dixie Egerickx as guilt-stricken youngsters who fear they summoned the beast, to Poesy who \u2013 as gentle, watchful Stella, is a heartbroken and heartbreaking revelation.For all that, there is something strangely cold and sluggish about the adaptation of Perry\u2019s book, which despite being a novel of ideas, was lush and vibrant, too. Although it excavated the links between myth, science and religion, it held up love in all its forms to the light as well. Platonic love, sexual love, requited and unrequited romantic love, love of a child, of a vocation, of discovery, of God. It was Wuthering Heights pulled into shape and given intellectual rigour without losing any of its sweeping gothic passion. But on screen, abundance has become austerity, suppressed feeling shades into inertia and the protagonists keep treading and retreading the same small patch of argumentative ground instead of sparking off each other and forging the greater and greater bond on which the story should turn.Maybe I am simply too much a fan of the book. Symon\u2019s take works perfectly well as a drama that delivers suitably sinuous twists and, under Clio Barnard\u2019s direction, looks grimly fabulous, emerging out of the marsh mists that seem to promise that any malevolence is possible. And Danes grounds and gives a remarkable truth to the whole. But even allowing for the fact that screen adaptations rarely capture the full filigree of a literary novelist\u2019s work (one reason why uncomplicated genre fiction generally fares better \u2013 there is more to add, less to lose), it feels like slightly too much has been lost in translation here.","485":"In the first Top Gun in 1986 \u2013 that anti-Strangelove cold war classic \u2013 the US Navy\u2019s fighter pilot Lt Pete \u201cMaverick\u201d Mitchell gets accused of letting his ego write cheques his body can\u2019t cash. But with the sequel, it\u2019s quite clear the body of Maverick, played by Tom Cruise, has been cashing cheques with abandon for decades. His pecs have been setting up standing orders. His biceps have been signing off on direct debits. His abs have been authorising BACS transfers and his rock-hard buttocks each have their own PayPal account. In short, as we return to the extraordinary story of Pete Mitchell, it\u2019s plain that he\u2019s still physically solvent, in the opening scene recklessly test-flying a colossal stealth fighter at Mach 10 against orders from the glowering officer on the ground (played by Ed Harris), who is forced to concede that he\u2019s \u201cgot balls\u201d. (They\u2019re both configured for contactless payment.)Almost 40 years on from the first film, which was directed by Tony Scott, Maverick is still speedy, less needy \u2013 more centred and calmer, in fact, but still in humungous shape and in love with flying. Directing duties are taken over by Joseph Kosinski, known for his digital effects and sci-fi, and the script is by Ehren Kruger, Eric Warren Singer and longtime Cruise collaborator Christopher McQuarrie. In 2022, Maverick is still only a captain, when he could have been an admiral by now. Despite his badass attitude, he\u2019s respected by the real flyers and loathed by the pointy-headed brass, and is protected by his enduring bromance with former classmate and rival Iceman, who is now an admiral. Val Kilmer gamely contributes a cameo.The inevitable crisis is a double-header. The Navy must get an elite team of pilots to carry out a Dam Busters-style raid on an anonymously-located nuclear enrichment plant. Commanding officer Cyclone (Jon Hamm) has the ticklish diplomatic task of telling Maverick to train this new generation of adorable hotheads without joining them in the skies himself. What\u2019s even trickier is that the new intake includes Bradley \u201cRooster\u201d Bradshaw (Miles Teller), son of Goose, played by Anthony Edwards in the first movie: Maverick\u2019s wingman and buddy, for whose fate many (including Rooster) still blame Maverick. But you can\u2019t stay mad at Maverick, or keep him on the ground, for long.There\u2019s plenty of rock\u2019n\u2019roll fighter-pilot action in this movie, but weirdly none of the homoerotic tension that back in the day had guys queueing up at the Navy recruitment booths set up in cinema foyers. Weirder still, it is actually less progressive on gender issues than the original film, which did after all put a woman in charge: astrophysicist Charlotte Blackwood, played by Kelly McGillis, was the trainer (inspired by real-life Pentagon official Christine Fox). Now it\u2019s Maverick in charge and there is just the one female pilot under his instruction: Phoenix, a thin role for Monica Barbaro. McGillis has evidently not been invited back and her character is never mentioned. The unmarried Maverick\u2019s love interest this time around is a nice woman who runs the local bar, an entirely thankless part for Jennifer Connelly.But where, oh where, is the towel-round-the-waist, semi-nude locker-room intensity between the guys? The guys who compete with each other but need each other? Well, nowhere. The confrontations happen in more wholesome, open conditions: in Connelly\u2019s bar, mostly, and a healthy good-natured game of beach football for team-building. Teller has to be a tough guy, so his late father Goose is remembered by this film as more of an alpha than he actually was: in fact, Goose was a nerdier and more retiring type, closer to this film\u2019s bespectacled comedy turn Bob (Lewis Pullman). Glen Powell plays an arrogant young pilot, call-sign Hangman, who has the burden of incarnating the big-headedness of both the younger Iceman and the younger Maverick.Cruise\u2019s movie-star chops are still miraculous though, and he has a genuinely touching dialogue scene with Kilmer. Now I want to see him take on a sequel to Risky Business and do the underpants dance again. Top Gun: Maverick screens at the Cannes film festival and is released on 26 May in Australia, and on 27 May in the US and UK.","486":"Gaspar No\u00e9 brings his cauterisingly fierce gaze to the spectacle of old age: the world of those about to enter the void. He brings to it a particular structural insight which I don\u2019t think I have ever seen represented so clearly. Dying is bifurcated: a real-time split-screen experience divided between the carer and the cared-for. An old married couple, people who have had a lifetime to wonder which of them will die first and which of them will have to take up the burden of care, find that it is not so clear during the terrible endgame itself.Veteran director Dario Argento and actor, screenwriter and director Fran\u00e7oise Lebrun play a couple who live together in a small, chaotic Parisian apartment covered in an amiable clutter of books and papers. He is evidently a film-maker or maybe a writer, working on a book about cinema and dreams entitled Psyche; she is a retired psychiatrist. They have a son, St\u00e9phane (Alex Lutz) who is himself the father of a small boy, and burdened with drug issues and money and marital worries. The movie opens \u2013 ominously \u2013 with a video clip of Fran\u00e7oise Hardy performing the 60s chanson Mon Amie la Rose, about the mortality of flowers. Then Argento and Lebrun enjoy a modest meal on their rickety terrace: these are Lebrun\u2019s final moments of lucidity. We learn that she suffered a stroke a few years ago and has been descending into dementia since then; recently the rate of decline has accelerated.No\u00e9 splits the screen into two, dual stories running concurrently, showing in one half Argento\u2019s character pottering thoughtfully about the flat, in denial about what is happening: reading, snoozing, clattering away at his manual typewriter and also leaving surreptitious phone messages, like a lovelorn teenager, for a woman called Claire with whom he has been miserably in love for decades. Meanwhile, on the left-hand side of the screen, Lebrun\u2019s character, with the impassive, leonine expression of dementia patients, wanders off into the streets without telling her husband, or throws all his notes away, or dangerously leaves the gas on, all in a miserable haze of unknowing.St\u00e9phane comes around to see them, deeply upset by what is happening, and by his own inability to persuade them to enter a care home; this is a subject complicated by his own history with his psychiatrist mother, stricken by the fact that he and they now live in a world of drugs, legal and illegal. No\u00e9 will periodically contrive a camera-cut in either of the frames and resume from another point of view; occasionally the two scenes will overlap creating a Hockneyesque perspective-dissonance. Brutally, the medium is the message. These two people will never again share the same screen.This is a movie without the pornographic and psychedelic sheen of No\u00e9\u2019s previous work, but those earlier pictures had a recurring trick: forcing audiences to the edge of nausea by making them stare into a vortex of flickering stroboscopic light. In this movie, death is the vortex: the dark focus, whose gravitational pull gets stronger \u2013 and harder to avoid thinking about \u2013 with every passing year. And Vortex tells us something else about old age, something which a severe and high-minded movie like Michael Haneke\u2019s Amour would not grasp: death is chaotic, like life. It ends with things undone and in messy disarray. This is a work of wintry maturity, and real compassion. Vortex is released on 13 May in cinemas.","487":"In this de facto, if far from de jure, latest iteration of the Ted franchise, Mark Wahlberg once again forms a strange, almost inexplicable bond with a supernatural creature who tests him in a number of painful, problematic ways. However \u2013 surprise! \u2013 instead of a stuffed teddy bear that\u2019s come to life, this time the agent of chaos is God himself, that omnipresent, omniscient, all-powerful scamp. God first makes the life of Wahlberg\u2019s Stuart Long hard by taking away his little brother via a sudden death when they are little kids, and then giving him a nature that gets him into trouble throughout his life, keeping him from finding a vocation until he finally Finds a Vocation, ie the desire to become a priest.On the plus side, Stu at least has a number of nice people rooting for him and helping him out, including his feisty mom Kathleen (Jacki Weaver). There\u2019s also a saintly girlfriend named Carmen (Teresa Ruiz) who first leads him to the church, and variously supportive fellow seminary students (Aaron Moten and Cody Fern) who, like most of the supporting cast, deserve canonisation for offering very strong performances as unexpectedly well defined characters. And I am loth to admit this but that also goes for Mel Gibson; if you can separate the dancer from dance, he is an actor capable of bringing a face like a long stretch of ravaged road and a credible impression of pain to the role of Stu\u2019s alcoholic dad Billy. Still, Gibson\u2019s connections to a particularly retrograde, Opus Dei-adjacent branch of the Catholic church represents a problem for a movie that wants us to celebrate the faith\u2019s ability to be more inclusive and accepting of renegades. Is this really what Jesus would have wanted?There is a nice soundtrack by Dickon Hinchliffe, sometime Tinderstick and composer of several great soundtracks for directors such as Claire Denis, Debra Granik and Maggie Gyllenhaal. What he\u2019s doing working with the likes of Gibson is puzzling but we all have our crosses to bear. There are also good bits in this based-on-a-true-story drama, including the aforementioned performances and a commitment to theology so sincere it\u2019s not afraid to bore an audience with lots of pin-head-fine debates about Godhood. If Gibson weren\u2019t part of the package it might be possible to like it more. Father Stu is released on 13 May in cinemas.","488":"Draped in deerskins, armed with a roughly hewn axe and a bow, Martin (Rasmus Bjerg) is at one with the land. He appreciatively sniffs a handful of what looks suspiciously like faeces, scans the undergrowth, before looming over his prey. He is, in his mind at least, a mighty hunter. The score, an urgent, muscular battle cry on sawing double bass, agrees with him. But his prey is a small frog, and Martin\u2019s attempts to live on the land are doomed by the fact that he is an ordinary suburban father of two in the throes of the mother of all midlife crises.Martin\u2019s adventure in the mountains of Norway takes a new direction when he teams up with Musa (Zaki Youssef), an injured criminal on the run from the cops and his former partners. Martin also finds himself on the wrong side of the law after a botched attempt at bartering, followed by a raid on a Viking village (he steals a catering pack of bread rolls).What makes this amiably amusing Danish comedy work is the fact that it takes its hapless protagonist almost as seriously as he takes himself. And while Martin\u2019s tragicomic plight is the central focus, director Thomas Daneskov and co-writer Morten Pape take an unusual degree of care with the fleshed-out supporting characters, particularly Martin\u2019s longsuffering wife, Anne (The Killing\u2019s Sofie Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l), who wrangles two emotional children and a husband who would rather live on lichen than deal with his marital issues.","489":"This tender tribute to dancing\/mime\/commedia dell\u2019arte masters Barry and Joan Grantham is as sweet and nostalgic as elderflower cordial. Married for donkey\u2019s years, the couple are somewhere in their 80s or 90s. This film is airily unspecific about such details, although every clip showing one of their film appearances is accompanied by a date, some going back to the 1940s.Manchester-reared Barry started out as a \u201cballet boy\u201d, trained with famed dancer Stanislas Idzikowski whom he still refers to as his \u201cbeloved master\u201d, and even appeared in Powell and Pressburger\u2019s The Red Shoes in 1948. Joan, from the more genteel home counties, was a second or third generation musician and came up through the business as a dancer as well, but also tickled the ivories; now she mostly plays accompaniment on the piano in the couple\u2019s studio as they train various adult pupils in the mysteries of commedia, diction and performance in general.The students interviewed here clearly adore them, and talk with endearing, gushy enthusiasm about the experience of learning from them. Director Audrey Rumsby, one of the Granthams\u2019 students herself, clearly shares that affection but smartly upholsters her film with a rich seam of archive footage and original animation that goes well beyond the title couple themselves. As a result, the movie provides a brisk, efficient primer on commedia dell\u2019arte, from its roots in Italy and on through Moli\u00e8re and Shakespeare, on to vaudeville and Max Miller, and right up to James Corden and One Man, Two Guvnors. Friends of the Granthams offer extra insight about the use of masks and acting skills. The whole package works a treat for theatre geeks, mime fans and lovers of \u201ceccentric dance.\u201d Barry & Joan is released on 6 May in cinemas.","490":"There is something inherently cinematic about the work of Australian musicians and composers Nick Cave and Warren Ellis. The pair have collaborated on a string of scores for films, ranging from John Hillcoat\u2019s 2005 antipodean western The Proposition (for which Cave also wrote the script) to the forthcoming Blonde, director Andrew Dominik\u2019s adaptation of Joyce Carol Oates\u2019s historical fiction novel about \u201cthe inner life of Marilyn Monroe\u201d. Yet even away from the movie theatre, Ellis and Cave\u2019s compositions have a widescreen sweep, conjuring intimate aural landscapes of love and death \u2013 religion and fairytale intertwined. These are musical parables of grief and redemption, echoing Cave\u2019s belief that \u201cwe all live our lives dangerously, in a state of jeopardy, at the edge of calamity\u201d.In his 2016 film One More Time With Feeling, Dominik (with whom the pair had worked on the underrated masterpiece The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford) documented the creative process behind the Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds album Skeleton Tree, a record forged in the wake of a terrible family tragedy. Now, Dominik turns his attention to a new chapter in Cave and Ellis\u2019s musical saga, as they prepare songs from the albums Ghosteen and Carnage before a 2021 tour.Shot without an audience, in cavernous, church-like venues in Brighton and London where white lights illuminate pools of darkness visible, the performances are utterly engrossing, captured on hypnotically spiralling cameras by the Irish cinematographer Robbie Ryan. The atmosphere is stripped down and austere, allowing the songs to speak for themselves as they transport us from this world to the next.With trademark wry humour, Dominik\u2019s film opens with Cave declaring that, during lockdown, he took the opportunity to retrain (against his manager\u2019s advice) as a ceramicist. The fruits of his labour include a series of figurines telling the pathos-laden story of the devil; from birth, through war, to damnation and remorse. Later, Cave reveals that while he would once have described himself as a musician and writer, now he is striving to shed those labels in favour of being a husband, father, friend and citizen.He is also clearly a preacher, holding his fingers like a saint or a pope, while singing songs whose pulpit revelry is amplified by the gospel-style harmonies of his backing singers. There\u2019s a touch of Vegas, too, about his trademark combination of suit and open-necked shirt \u2013 a familiar uniform that seems to imply the good, the bad and the ugly, all wrapped up in one seductively slender package.Ellis is no less striking, a brooding Catweazle-like figure on keyboard and fiddle, part Merlin, part hillbilly \u2013 Paganini meets Alvin Stardust. Whether conducting like a musical Kafka or playing the flute in a cardie, Ellis cuts a thrillingly mystical figure, making it all the more delightful when guest performer Marianne Faithfull asks in disbelief: \u201cDid he just call you Waz?\u201d It\u2019s a throwaway moment, but one that embodies the balance between the ecstatic and the everyday that this documentary captures so perfectly.Conversations about Ellis and Cave\u2019s disparate working methods are striking, with the latter insisting that Ellis is an agent of chaos who is always in \u201ctransmit\u201d (rather than \u201creceive\u201d) mode, making it impossible to simply present him with anything as traditional as a \u201csong\u201d. \u201cA whole lot of terrible shit happens when me and Warren get into a room,\u201d Cave admits. \u201cBut there are these moments when it just\u2026 \u201d Ellis calls those moments \u201cmeditative\u201d; Cave calls them \u201ctranscendent\u201d.\u201cBehind it all \u2013 the music, the words, the suits, the grief, the tenderness and shame and guilt and joy \u2013 who are you?\u201d asks someone on Cave\u2019s website, The Red Hand Files. It\u2019s a question that Dominik seeks not to answer but rather to reflect, trusting his audience to make up their own mind about one of the most innovative collaborations that the worlds of film and music currently have to offer. In cinemas on Wednesday 11 May only; digital release to follow","491":"By definition, multiverses are everywhere. But do they really need to be quite so ubiquitous? The multiverse concept triggered a playful, pinballing game of narrative tag in the Spider-Man franchise, and unleashes an anarchic onslaught of silliness in Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert\u2019s forthcoming Everything Everywhere All at Once. But in this latest outing for Benedict Cumberbatch\u2019s Dr Strange, who is tasked with protecting dimension-hopping teen America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez) from nefarious forces intent on stealing her powers, the whole multiverse business is starting to feel more like a joylessly efficient get-out card to be played whenever the screenplay finds itself written into a corner.There\u2019s an early high point in which Strange and Wong (Benedict Wong) are forced to do battle with a monocular giant octopus, while Rachel McAdams\u2019s Christine, whose wedding has been interrupted by the tentacled gatecrasher, simply rolls her eyes. But the fun is short-lived, courtesy of Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) and director Sam Raimi\u2019s commitment to grisly visual flourishes. Unlike movies such as Black Panther and Shang-Chi, which functioned as self-contained entities, this film requires an encyclopedic knowledge of Marvel minutiae and world-class cross-referencing skills to fully work. And who, outside the diehard fanbase, has the bandwidth for that level of commitment?","492":"A vulnerable teen embarks on a sinister online game in this uneasy, ultra-low-budget psychological horror. We\u2019re All Going to the World\u2019s Fair captures something of the hostile virtual terrain that today\u2019s kids learn to navigate, encountering unknowable horrors that subtly change them for ever. As such, it probably taps more successfully into parental paranoia than it does into actual dark-web peril. Unfortunately, the film runs out of ideas and steam before it delivers any real scares.","493":"The Arabic title of Franco-Moroccan director Nabil Ayouch\u2019s empowering hip-hop fable translates loosely as \u201crise your voice\u201d, while in France, where the film competed for the Cannes Palme d\u2019Or, it\u2019s known as Haut et fort \u00ad\u2013 \u201chigh and loud\u201d. Both monikers perfectly capture the vibrant spirit of this stirring street musical, described by its creator as arising out of \u201cthe desire to make a film to give voice to young people\u201d. On one level it\u2019s a patchwork of popular cinematic tropes, combining the strength-through-music themes of films as diverse as 8 Mile and School of Rock with the inspirational classroom formats of everything from Blackboard Jungle to Dead Poets Society. But there\u2019s also a strong whiff of the discursive politics of Ken Loach\u2019s Land and Freedom, mixed with the accessible rebellion of Jafar Panahi\u2019s Offside or Deniz Gamze Erg\u00fcven\u2019s Mustang \u2013 a heady brew indeed.Real-life rapper turned teacher Anas Basbousi keeps things close to home as new teacher at an arts centre in the Sidi Moumen district of Casablanca, an area still stained by the spectre of fomenting terrorism. On his first day, Anas boldly spray-paints the wall of his classroom, only to be told that it\u2019s not his classroom \u2013 it\u2019s a classroom, one that is used by others who don\u2019t necessarily appreciate his rebellious free-form vibe. Tensions increase when Anas meets his class, played by screen first-timers scouted at Les \u00c9toiles de Sidi Moumen (a cultural centre co-founded by Ayouch), whose real lives inspired their fictional on-screen alter egos. As each student takes the floor to show the new teacher what they can do, he dismissively bats aside their efforts, accusing them of failing to use their authentic voices and reducing one misfit to tears for bragging about a life that bears little resemblance to his own.It\u2019s formulaically clear from the outset where this is going, and no one should be in any doubt that Anas\u2019s harsh words are merely an educational provocation, a wakeup call to the youngsters in whom he divines true potential. Sure enough, they soon start to step up, none more so than the young women whose rhymes tell hidden stories, leading to an outpouring of feminist strength that infuriates a zealous classmate nicknamed \u201cthe Imam\u201d. Meanwhile, out-of-school lives start to intrude upon the classroom, with outraged parents banning their offspring from attending, leading to moral battles between Anas and his more stuffy superiors. There\u2019s even a West Side Story-style confrontation with oppressive authority.Shot over 15 months, which allowed the project to grow organically, Ayouch\u2019s film retains a gritty authenticity despite embracing often cliched dramatic tropes. Like Clio Barnard\u2019s Ali & Ava, this down-to-earth tale is not afraid of embracing the magical elements of the musical. Yes, the v\u00e9rit\u00e9-style camerawork of Virginie Surdej and Amine Messadi creates \u201cthe illusion of a documentary\u201d (there are shades of Nicolas Philibert\u2019s \u00catre et Avoir), convincing us that what we see on screen is \u201creal\u201d. But Khalid Benghrib\u2019s sinewy choreography elevates the action above the everyday, creating fusions of poetry and dance that at times put me in mind of Philippe Lac\u00f4te\u2019s hallucinogenic Ivorian prison drama Night of the Kings \u2013 a very different film, perhaps, but one that similarly blended elements of documentary and fantasia to thrilling effect.With original music by Mike and Fabien Kourtzer and performance scenes that take the cast from the classroom to the recording studio, the stage and beyond, Casablanca Beats (which, like Ayouch\u2019s previous films Mektoub, Ali Zaoua: Prince of the Streets, Horses of God and Razzia, was Morocco\u2019s entry for the Academy Awards) has an infectious energy that pulls us into the ever-changing worlds of its characters. Crucially, it does so in a manner that is both enticing and accessible, giving a platform to the young voices that Ayouch passionately believes are a positive force in increasingly troubled times, offering \u201ca sign that the world is changing\u201d. On this evidence, it\u2019s hard to disagree.","494":"The title of the second Downton Abbey movie promises a new era, but in fact this is a reheated serving of reassuringly familiar comfort food for fans of the series. The same crusty class certainties under the same cold, Wedgwood-blue skies; the same light sprinkling of xenophobia and the same eager score that bustles in between lines of dialogue like an over-solicitous waiter.The story takes up where the last picture, already something of a redundant postscript to the television series, left off: widower Tom Branson (Allen Leech) marries Lucy Smith (Tuppence Middleton). But the Crawley family is soon shaken by two events. First, fearsome matriarch Violet Crawley (Maggie Smith), whose bon mots are now a little bon moth-eaten but who remains one of the more entertaining characters, reveals that she has acquired a French villa. Second, a film crew invades Downton, causing much kerfuffle, but paying handsomely.In the collision between aristocracy and the world of entertainment, writer Julian Fellowes pays loving tribute to himself and his breakthrough film, Gosford Park. But a plot device that hinges on the transition between the silent movie era and the talkies is lifted rather more obviously from Singin\u2019 in the Rain. It\u2019s a comparison that does this artless cash-in no favours.","495":"You can sort of tell what kind of film writer-director-co-star Savvas D Michael thought he was making, given the lofty references to Homer\u2019s Iliad in the plotting, Martin Scorsese movies in the dialogue, and Guy Ritchie in the casting \u2013 given the presence here of Vinnie Jones in a cameo role. However, the result is an intensely irritating hot mess, a London petty criminal story set in the Greek Cypriot community that\u2019s offensive, self-indulgent and stupid.The title refers to a private club of the same name, run by one Plato Andinos (Andreas Karras), a small-time big shot who likes to throw parties with strippers for his mates, and preaches homophobia and sexism at home to his kids. His wife, Helen (Marina Sirtis, from Star Trek Generations) puts up with it all because she gets knockoff designer handbags and a tacky house that makes the cribs in The Only Way Is Essex look like items from Architectural Digest. But Plato\u2019s home life is only peripheral to the story, which mostly revolves around the exploits and hijinks of him and his crew, a motley selection of knaves, one of whom is a supposedly handsome and supposedly unbeatable scrapper named Achilles (played by Michael himself).Stung when his romantic overtures are rejected by local beauty-cum-poker-hustler Lola (Lois Brabin-Platt, whose display of sass represents one of the film\u2019s few amusements), Achilles goes into a sulk in Homeric fashion. This causes considerable distress in particular to Achilles\u2019 No 1 fan, Anthony (Jamie Crew), seemingly also expected to be considered an object of pity given Crew\u2019s manic and mannered display of verbal diarrhoea, delivered with a speech impediment and jerky movements.Perhaps Anthony is the character for whom we\u2019re supposed to feel sorry. That said, hardly anyone is even vaguely likable here, which needn\u2019t necessarily have been a drawback, but they should at least be in some way interesting. No such luck. Londoners may find amusement in trying to guess where the exteriors were shot. The Bezonians is on digital platforms from 2 May.","496":"A cheeky-faced boy of seven or eight is asked what he would wish for. \u201cA big bike and a balloon that never bursts!\u201d he replies with a huge grin, tickled with his answer. Another boy around the same age, more shabbily dressed and serious looking, is asked what life is about. He chews his bottom lip: \u201cLife is something that is filled with difficulty.\u201d This often heartbreaking, painful documentary from Ashkan Nejati and Mehran Nematollahi has a simple premise: interviewing Iranian schoolkids to camera about their lives, school, homework and hopes for the future.It\u2019s a sequel of sorts to godfather of modern Iranian cinema Abbas Kiarostami\u2019s 1989 documentary Homework, which put the same questions to children growing up in the shadow of the Iran-Iraq war. The new film features plenty of kids-say-the-funniest-things moments. A boy is asked which countries he\u2019d like to visit? \u201cEurope, America \u2026 Neptune!\u201d And there\u2019s some commentary on the Iranian education system. But what lingers is the film\u2019s devastating snapshot of the gap between rich and poor. One of the rich kids, a placid round-faced boy, brags about how well-off his dad is and how many cars they\u2019ve got. The interviewer gently probes him: do you know what wealth is? \u201cYes, someone who has a lot of cash like my dad.\u201d Do you know what poverty is? \u201cNo.\u201dIf he ever watches the film he\u2019ll find out. You can spot the poor kids instantly, and not just from their faded, many-times-washed sweaters and DIY haircuts. It\u2019s their clenched body language and lined-before-their-time serious faces \u2013 a reminder that for them there\u2019s no time for silliness or play. The headteacher of these boys explains that in calendar years, they are eight to 10, but maturity wise, more like 17 or 18. Most work afternoons and evenings, selling goods on the street or busking. One boy explains how he burns newspaper and rubs the soot on his face to look dirtier, more pitiable. Another pays his family\u2019s rent and food. \u201cI don\u2019t buy toys. When you need to fill your belly, you don\u2019t buy toys.\u201d It\u2019s not an easy watch, but these kids are invisible enough without the world shutting its eyes. Tonight\u2019s Homework is released on 22 April at Bertha DocHouse, London.","497":"Nicolas Cage has officially revealed he\u2019s in on the joke \u2026 if \u201cjoke\u201d is precisely what it is. But has that spoiled the joke \u2013 if that is the correct word? This is a self-aware action comedy whose title is possibly the funniest bit, riffing on Milan Kundera\u2019s The Unbearable Lightness of Being as well as possibly Dave Eggers\u2019s memoir A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius. Producer-star Cage plays \u201cNick Cage\u201d: Hollywood ledge and national treasure (to quote a relevant movie title) now in a midlife crisis, haunted by CGI-doppelganger visions of his angry younger self, no longer booking the big roles and facing a grim future in which, as his agent (Neil Patrick Harris) puts it, he plays the cool gay uncle in a Duplass brothers film.Cage is living in a hotel, estranged from his wife Olivia (a thanklessly unfunny role for Sharon Horgan) and moody teen daughter Addy (Lily Mo Sheen), who hates the movie classics he tries introducing her to. (I was waiting for Addy to declare herself instead a massive fan of movies by the Coppola family. Maybe that would be an in-joke too far.) Cash-strapped Cage is forced to accept a million-dollar appearance fee at the spectacular luxury home of a billionaire plutocrat Javi Gutierrez (Pedro Pascal) who is a besotted superfan. But then the CIA gets word to our hero that Javi is a dangerous cartel gangster and Cage must use his privileged access to bring him down.There are some entertaining meta-touches here, but the entire Gutierrez plot is strained and borderline dull. Pascal isn\u2019t a natural comic and the movie winds up fudging his crucial bad-guy status. As for Cage, this isn\u2019t like Leslie Nielsen sending up his erstwhile straight-lead image for Airplane! and The Naked Gun, nor is it exactly like John Malkovich fabricating a complex fictional self in Being John Malkovich. Cage simply plays Cage in the moderate script he\u2019s been given, in that utterly committed, strangely uncomplicated way that has won the hearts of fans who declare themselves on the right side of the laugh-with\/laugh-at dividing line. But Cage has already done a far more interesting postmodern film about the film business \u2013 Spike Jonze\u2019s Adaptation, written by Charlie Kaufman, in which Cage gave a far better (dual) performance in a much funnier and better written film as the tormented screenwriter-artist Charlie Kaufman and his middlebrow twin brother Donald. In comparison, this feels lightweight. The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent is released on 22 April in cinemas.","498":"Laura Wandel\u2019s debut feature was Belgium\u2019s official submission for the Oscars: a kid\u2019s-eye-view nightmare of playground bullying impossible to watch without a sick, jittery feeling of rage and dread. The original French title is \u201cUn Monde\u201d \u2013 \u201cA World\u201d \u2013 and the playground is a universe of fear which we all edit out of our adult memories.A rather amazing seven-year-old newcomer called Maya Vanderbeque stars as Nora, seen mostly in extreme, searching closeup. Just the opening shot of her crying face supplies pretty much enough emotional charge to power the whole film. Nora is just starting school, and her sobbing mini-drama-queen distress at the school gates discomforts her dad (Karim Leklou) and especially her older brother Abel (G\u00fcnter Duret), a wannabe tough guy who doesn\u2019t want his clingy kid sister embarrassing him in the playground. When she witnesses him being bullied by the other boys \u2013 with whom Abel had hoped to bully someone else \u2013 she tells the teachers and her dad, thus humiliating him and breaking a whole unwritten statute book about not snitching.At first, Nora artlessly tries informing on the bullies to her own teacher, Mme Agn\u00e8s (Laura Verlinden) whose ineffective attempts at rebuking the boys appears to irritate their teacher, whose prerogative this actually is, and who perhaps sees Mme Agn\u00e8s\u2019s intervention as an implied criticism of her professionalism. And so at the crucial moment she has neither the time nor the inclination to back her up: a fatal concession. And when Nora\u2019s dad clumsily tries yelling at the bullies, it naturally makes things far worse, a mishandled situation which metastasises horribly.A world of adult indifference is revealed: those supposed authority figures are way out of the frame, as remote as the uniformed prison guards patrolling the exercise yard. As with Yasmin Reza\u2019s stage-play Carnage, filmed by Roman Polanski in 2011, or perhaps the enigmatic schoolgates scene that closes Michael Haneke\u2019s 2005 film Hidden, the power politics of kids has implications for the adults. The playground\u2019s hidden theatre of violence echoes in the headteacher\u2019s office and in the kitchens at home, among the grownups whose own childhoods involved dutifully learning the lesson that violence is unacceptable \u2013 but who find that anger is still a natural instinct when it comes to protecting and being seen to protect.As for Nora herself, the film shows us that she is not exactly a moral agent: she fiercely objects to bullying, but also unhelpfully denounces Abel\u2019s failure to stand up for himself and objects to anyone\u2019s failure to take her feelings into account. It is her tactless courage and willingness to intervene that is finally to make a difference \u2013 but she is also a bit of an egotist. There is a telling scene in which she hugs her beloved Mme Agn\u00e8s with that same theatrically possessive desperation she showed in the opening shot, which makes the teacher just the tiniest bit impatient with her.At just 72 minutes, this is a brief, intense feature: it\u2019s possible that Wandel envisaged it as even shorter than it actually is, and perhaps its narrative tendons slacken a little after the initial spasm of horror. But what an incredible performance from Vanderbeque: an intuition of fear and pain and moral outrage that goes beyond acting. Playground is released on 22 April on cinemas.","499":"This documentary represents a painstakingly detailed, fantastically entertaining, and profoundly exhausting deep dive into the career of the hyper-prolific Italian composer Ennio Morricone, known best perhaps for his orchestral scores for Sergio Leone (including the so-called Dollars Trilogy and Once Upon a Time in the West), Gillo Pontecorvo\u2019s The Battle of Algiers, Bernardo Bertolucci\u2019s 1900 \u2013 and a whole bunch of American films, ranging from the great (Terrence Malick\u2019s Days of Heaven, Brian De Palma\u2019s The Untouchables) to the abominable (Quentin Tarantino\u2019s The Hateful Eight).It\u2019s not so much the running time of 156 minutes that will tire you out as the incredible sonic, visual and emotional overload generated by the work itself; perhaps this is ideally seen first in a cinema for maximum impact and then again in small, digestible chunks at home. It\u2019s one huge cinematic mosaic that tessellates a massive interview with the man himself (fortuitously filmed just before he died in 2020) with acres of archival footage and snippets from the movies he wrote soundtracks for.On top of that, there\u2019s hundreds of interview clips from his innumerable collaborators, friends and admirers \u2013 even if some of them seem to be there just to show off how good the producers were at snagging big names. (Bruce Springsteen, for example, is a bit too gushy and hyperbolic.) However, any weak spots are more than compensated for by the overall level of discourse that gives paramount place to the music above all else, with intelligent, pithy observations from Morricone\u2019s classical composer contemporaries such as Boris Porena, as well as other film music maestros including Hans Zimmer and Mychael Danna.As you would expect, there are lots of lovely personal anecdotes from assorted collaborators, including Joan Baez and singers little known outside of Italy who remember Morricone\u2019s innovative arrangements for RCA pop songs before he moved into film. English director Roland Joff\u00e9 is particularly entertaining, showing off his Italian while discussing Morricone\u2019s mighty score for Joff\u00e9\u2019s The Mission, which we see performed by a massive orchestra with Morricone conducting. Given the documentary\u2019s director is Giuseppe Tornatore, it\u2019s no surprise a small chunk is given over to his collaborations with Morricone such as Cinema Paradiso, but on the whole Tornatore makes it ultimately about his main subject. Kudos is also due to editor Massimo Quaglia\u2019s astonishingly fluid work splicing it all together. Ennio is released on 22 April in cinemas and on digital platforms.","500":"This soulful, heavy hearted drama tells a tale of gentrification and community displacement in Cambodia. It\u2019s a fictional story about the real-life White Building, an iconic modernist apartment block built in 1963 in the centre of Phnom Penh and demolished in 2017. The film\u2019s director, Kavich Neang, has a personal connection: he grew up in the White Building and opens his film with an extraordinary drone shot that floats above the building\u2019s roof. From this angle the mosaic of chipped tiles and rusted corrugated sheets looks strangely beautiful: a metaphor perhaps for the White Building itself, which is crumbling and not fit for habitation, but still home to a vibrant diverse community, everyone happily jostling in the corridors.Neang\u2019s story is about a boy\u2019s coming of age as his family is evicted. Piseth Chhun gives a sensitive performance as Nang, who at the start of the movie, bleached streaks in his hair, dreams of boyband-style fame with his hip-hop dance squad, which is basically him and two mates. He lives with his mum and sculptor dad in the building, whose residents are being pushed out so property developers can move in. The miserably low payoff will force most of them out of the city, where house prices are skyrocketing.The film follows Nang as he matures from boy to man. His dad is spokesman for the tenants\u2019 association, and there are bad-tempered meetings about whether to accept the eviction deal. Then the building\u2019s water supply is switched off. Worryingly, Nang\u2019s dad has an infected big toe, which appears to be gangrenous, a complication of diabetes; the blackening spreads like the mould on the apartment\u2019s ceiling.This is a gentle-going watch, understated \u2013 underpowered even \u2013 and sometimes a little drowsy. Still, it has real sensitivity and insight into the transition to adulthood, as gradually it dawns on Nang that his parents don\u2019t have all the answers.White Building is available on Mubi from Wednesday.","501":"It\u2019s strange that the silly but mostly tolerable horror Choose or Die was an acquisition rather than a homegrown Netflix original given how much it seems algorithmically modeled for the notoriously formula-obsessed platform. It stars Asa Butterfield, an in-house star thanks to the success of Sex Education. It\u2019s contemporary-set but baked in 80s nostalgia, something that also inspires the aesthetic of the aforementioned comedy series as well as the entirety of long-running hit Stranger Things. It also focuses on a cursed video game, making it a close cousin to the streamer\u2019s interactive Black Mirror hit Bandersnatch. It\u2019s a film destined to live its days in the \u201cif you like\u201d container.It\u2019ll probably fare well there as fans of the above might find just about enough here to play with although they might, like me, be a little surprised at just how nasty this quickie horror is, made with closer attention to the gore quotient than any level of creativity. It\u2019s part of the cursed tech subgenre that expanded after the success of Gore Verbinski\u2019s surprisingly effective remake of Ringu, later retitled The Ring. It led to more similarly plotted Asian horror remakes, such as One Missed Call, Pulse and Shutter, and then also a string of US copycats, like Feardotcom, Unfriended and Stay Alive, a 2006 flop that saw a group of teens playing a deadly video game. We\u2019re in similar, yet mildly more proficient, territory here with the discovery of a dusty 80s game called CURS>R (the film\u2019s original title), that coerces players into making genuine life-or-death decisions.It\u2019s found by 80s-obsessive Isaac (Butterfield), compelled by the idea that the $125,000 prize money might still lay unclaimed and further seduced by the recorded voice of Freddy Krueger himself, Robert Englund, at the end of the hotline. His friend, and object of affection, Kayla (relative newcomer Iola Evans) is less convinced but living on the breadline has her willing to take a chance, struggling to get by on a measly cleaner\u2019s wage. And so it begins.What\u2019s vaguely refreshing about this admittedly rather ho-hum set-up is that Kayla isn\u2019t the hands-on-hips scold she might have been in another more cliche version of this story but the one who boots up the game herself to play. She\u2019s as tech-savvy as Isaac and the film\u2019s main, plot-propelling protagonist. The first encounter with the game sees Kayla playing in an empty diner, forced to watch a flirty waitress eat glass in front of her. It\u2019s a bracingly nasty scene, automatically cluing us into the torture porn-adjacent territory we\u2019re in, far from what we might have expected (there\u2019s a whiff of the far superior Escape Room films here which exist firmly in the world of PG-13).But while the gore is impressively visceral and well-realised, the rest of it is a few steps behind. It\u2019s an overwhelmingly British film, shot in London with local actors (there\u2019s a bookending appearance from Eddie Marsan while soap stalwart Angela Griffin also pops up), that\u2019s bizarrely set in an unnamed US city, forcing everyone into at times laughably shoddy Ay-meh-reek-uhn accents. It\u2019s a baffling misstep, clearly made for commercial reasons, that adds a layer of amateurishness to what\u2019s otherwise a solidly directed first feature for Brit Toby Meakins. He doesn\u2019t quite take enough advantage of his reality-shifting game sequences (the Englund voice cameo serves to remind us just how wild Wes Craven made those nightmares way back when) but it\u2019s a cut above the average Netflix genre guff.The script, from TV writer Simon Allen, acts as mostly just pedestrian framework for the game scenes, which thankfully do arrive quite often. The specifics of the plot make little to no real sense, even in the moment, but that won\u2019t much matter to the sleepover crowd, who\u2019ll be too distracted by the nasty noise of it all. Don\u2019t understand how a malevolent curse ties to game code? Who cares, here\u2019s a teenager eating his arm! In a choice between coherence and cruelty, it\u2019s an easy win.Choose or Die is available on Netflix now","502":"In the opening scenes of Pelin Esmer\u2019s heartwarming documentary, the sublime and the quotidian are beautifully intertwined. The tranquil sight of a group of older women enjoying a seaside dip is juxtaposed with a striking view of the Roman amphitheatre overlooking the deep blue ocean. Unassuming in appearance, the women quickly transform into thespians, taking over the ancient site and making it a rehearsal space for an amateur production of King Lear. Coming from an impoverished rural background, this unlikely peasant-women theatre troupe brings the magic of Shakespeare to remote Turkish villages where even the basic staple of drinking-water is nonexistent.Their performances often take place on school playgrounds, and are rudimentary in terms of costuming and staging. Wearing their own clothes, the women give Shakespeare a regional otherworldliness. And alongside the evident communal pleasure inspired by such events, the off-stage interactions between the performers and the villagers are equally fascinating. Zeynep, who plays Lear, confides her youthful hope of becoming a nurse, which was was quickly quashed by her father\u2019s order that she must stick to raising goats. Performing has ignited a transformative sense of confidence in Zeynep, however. And the young girl she confides in has her own dream of teaching, though her future seems uncertain.The film\u2019s freewheeling structure makes for a great intimacy with its subjects but it doesn\u2019t help the viewer with the physical orientation of events, especially not those unfamiliar with the local geography. However, though modest in terms of visuals and scope, Queen Lear is an endearing ode to the collective power of art and a subtle call for gender equality in Turkey. Queen Lear is available on 18 April on True Story.","503":"British film-maker Chris Atkins is known for his excellent Bafta-winning documentary Taking Liberties in 2007 and also for his five-year jail sentence in 2016 for tax fraud involving falsified invoices: a conviction that sent a there-but-for-grace-of-God shiver through the British film world. It resulted in Atkins\u2019s bestselling prison memoir A Bit of a Stretch, which also became a hugely popular podcast. At the time I wrote about the heavy-handed prison treatment of Atkins\u2019s co-defendant, Christina Slater, who at the time was a new mother.Now Atkins has hit upon the ideal subject for what I can only describe as his talent for investigative mischief: it\u2019s the strange story of the KLF, later the K Foundation, comprising Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty, the electronic-pop-duo-slash-situationist\u2013art-collective who in the early 90s had gigantic chart hits with singles including 3am Eternal and What Time Is Love?, and then morphed into a guerrilla unit pranking what they saw as the money-crazed art world. They finally deleted their entire catalogue in a spectacular gesture of renunciation, and publicly set fire to the remaining million pounds in their bank account.Atkins reconstructs some of the band\u2019s occult events and theatre-of-the-absurd Guy Debord one-offs; he interviews some of the band\u2019s gobsmacked contemporaries and fans such as journalist James Brown, author Alan Moore and DJ Carl Cox, and claims that his audio interviews with Drummond and Cauty used here are \u201cpreviously unheard tapes\u201d \u2013 although we don\u2019t get to find out how and where these tapes surfaced. Could Atkins be playfully hinting that these tapes and the band\u2019s apparent non-cooperation with his film are not quite what they seem?Either way, it\u2019s a very entertaining guide through what has to be the strangest A-list pop career of modern times: a band who started weird and anti-materialistic, ended weird and anti-materialistic, and didn\u2019t sell out. And as for the million-pound-blaze, Atkins does his best to reconstruct the band\u2019s thinking. Most supposed the stunt to be either a pointless hoax or, if real, an obscene waste, given all the poverty in the world, and the film hints that the band themselves might just have had the nagging doubt that they had made a terrible mistake. It was a grand gesture which, to the extent that it was noticed at all, was a misfire. But it was a misfire born of their absolute refusal to conform to the careerist notion of success.Actually, this film reminded me of Banksy\u2019s 2010 documentary Exit Through the Gift Shop, in which the artist showed off his cardboard box full of faked \u00a310 notes with the face of Diana, Princess of Wales on them instead of the Queen\u2019s \u2013 forgeries that could in theory have got him into serious trouble. You could end the film wondering if the KLF even existed at all, if they were a dream or a countercultural mirage. If so, this is an enjoyable journey across the surface of an illusion. Who Killed the KLF? is available now on digital platforms.","504":"If the idea of a musical about grief sounds unlikely, it can only be because we have a limited idea of what that emotion should look like. The grief in Peter Mullan\u2019s 1998 movie Orphans is not of the maudlin, greetings-card kind. Rather, it is raw, dangerous and off-kilter.So it is in this National Theatre of Scotland staging, directed by Cora Bissett and scripted by Douglas Maxwell with songs by Roddy Hart and Tommy Reilly. It amplifies Mullan\u2019s emotional states into the raucous, the ribald and the plaintive.Set on a dark and stormy Glasgow night, Orphans is about four siblings from a working-class Catholic family who are about to bury their mother. Each embodies a different facet of grief.Robert Florence as elder brother Thomas becomes neurotically protective of the dead woman\u2019s memory, his anguish so profound it seems to rip the roof off the church. Reuben Joseph as Michael turns inward, reflecting on his damaged relationship with his ex-wife as he heads out for a bloody night of self-destruction.Dylan Wood as youngest brother John turns angry, displacing his sense of loss into a thirst for revenge and gun-toting violence. Amy Conachan\u2019s Sheila appears the most balanced, but she too races with a reckless abandon to fill the void left by the central figure in her life.The chaos of the night, with its fights, funfairs and feuds, stands as a metaphor for the family\u2019s inner turmoil. And even though it begins with a coffin and ends with a grave, the emotional extremes put a halt to sentimentality.They also make for a buoyant show. Staged on a set of towering sandstone tenements by Emily James, Bissett\u2019s production makes as much of the wider community \u2013 from the chorus of boozy drinkers to a trio of sharp-talking paper girls \u2013 as it does of the central players.Faithful to the big-screen original, Maxwell\u2019s script is characteristically funny while respecting Mullan\u2019s dark edges. It\u2019s a shame not to have live musicians, but the songs do well to carry the story forward, while cheerfully revelling in the Glasgow vernacular (not all of it is radio friendly). It adds up to a cathartic reckoning with mortality. Perhaps even good grief.At SEC Armadillo, Glasgow, until 9 April. Then touring until 30 April.","505":"In a flourish of passive-aggressive self-pity and spite, Vladimir Putin recently claimed that Russian culture was being cancelled in the west. The release of this excellent film proves him wrong: a movie about a Russian character behaving menacingly to someone from Finland, Russia\u2019s vulnerable neighbour, and yet being romantically redeemed. There is a bone-chilling cold in the film\u2019s location \u2013 Murmansk in Russia\u2019s remote north-west \u2013 but a wonderful human warmth and humour in this offbeat story of strangers on a train and of national characteristics starting to melt.It comes from Finnish director Juho Kuosmanen, whose 2016 film The Happiest Day in the Life of Olli M\u00e4ki was a lovely comedy about a real-life Finnish boxing champ in the 1960s. His new film is adapted from a novel of the same name by Finnish artist and author Rosa Liksom, and concerns a young Finnish student of archaeology, Laura (Seidi Haarla) who is in Moscow sometime in the early 90s; she has begun an impulsive affair with her professor, Irina (Dirana Drukarova). With Irina\u2019s encouragement, and perhaps because this older woman does not care to have her hanging around much longer, Laura has resolved to make the tough rail journey up to Murmansk where she wants to view the petroglyphs \u2013 mysterious rock drawings, thousands of years old.Sweet-natured, open-hearted Laura gets on this uncomfortable train in the freezing wintry cold, where she finds that she must share compartment number 6 with Ljoha (Yuriy Borisov), a boorish, drunk young guy who is on his way to get a job in a coal mine in Murmansk and is openly abusive, misogynistic and philistine about Laura\u2019s plans. And her phone calls back to Moscow reveal that Irina isn\u2019t exactly pining for her.Of course, it isn\u2019t too much of a stretch to see that after their meet-uncute, the relationship of Ljoha and Laura is going to thaw, although the obviousness of this trope has lessened in the last month. The romance that flowers between these two young people is in parallel with the romance of a long rail journey, and this is a very non-American equivalent of Richard Linklater\u2019s Before Sunrise movies. Ljoha\u2019s scowling face and shaven, bullet head make him look a tough guy at first, but it isn\u2019t long before we see him as a vulnerable little boy, never more so than when with Laura welcomes another Finnish guy to share their carriage - a self-admiringly sensitive type who insists on singing and playing his guitar. Ljoha is fiercely sceptical and resentful of this preening interloper, and he is right to be.In the end, no one wants to help Laura find these petroglyphs that she has set her heart on and travelled so far to see, and it is Ljoha himself who has to step up. Yes, this is a Russian without a Z on his clothes or in his heart, and of course the larger point is that of course, there are millions of Ljoha\u2019s fellow citizens who cannot be tarred by the malign mediocrity of Putin\u2019s chauvinism. There is charm and gentleness in this scene and the movie as a whole. Compartment No 6 is released on 8 April in cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema. This article was amended on 25 April 2022 to correct the name of male lead character Ljoha, from Vadim as an earlier version mistakenly said.","506":"Here is a celebratory documentary that takes for granted throughout that its audience is already hugely invested in its subject: the American TV chef and larger-than-life personality Julia Child. She is sufficiently legendary in the United States to have rated a biopic impersonation by Meryl Streep in the 2009 film Julie & Julia and also by Britain\u2019s Sarah Lancashire in the recent HBO TV series Julia (alongside an otherwise largely American cast). Added to which, Dan Aykroyd once did a Julia Child sketch on Saturday Night Live and David Cross in the TV comedy Arrested Development did a whooping Julia Child voice when he dressed up as a Mrs Doubtfire nanny.As for this documentary, it\u2019s a professionally made film with reasonable things to say about the birth of TV celebrity chef culture, challenging male dominance in the professional kitchen and Child\u2019s role in promoting the pre-eminence of French cuisine among America\u2019s emerging food-literate middle classes. But just as with that Meryl Streep movie, I found myself restless at the parochiality of this American icon, although the film does briefly ponder the French public\u2019s lack of interest in her.So why exactly should anyone outside the US care about Child? Do we expect American audiences to be fascinated by documentaries about Fanny Cradock? As far as UK audiences are concerned \u2026 well, why not a documentary about a Canadian TV chef? Or a Bulgarian TV chef? Or a Japanese TV chef? Of course, the American children\u2019s TV presenter Fred Rogers \u2013 glimpsed here \u2013 was also not much known in the UK, and the Tom Hanks film from 2019 about him, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood went over well. But that had a story to tell that reached out beyond the fanbase. And without that initial fanbase buy-in, Julia feels like a redundant tribute, with something very indulgent about the \u201cfoodie\u201d rhapsodising. Julia is released on 8 April in cinemas.","507":"Maybe a little unexpectedly, Amazon Studios have given us a very watchable and classily upscale espionage drama-thriller in the spirit of John le Carr\u00e9. Danish film-maker Janus Metz Pedersen directs and Olen Steinhauer adapts his own much-admired spy novella, centred on two former lovers in the cloak and dagger business who meet for dinner in a chi-chi Californian restaurant. The story is in fact inspired by a BBC TV drama that had nothing to do with spies: The Song of Lunch starring Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman.Henry Pelham (Chris Pine) is a CIA officer haunted by a disastrous event eight years earlier, when he was at the Vienna station: a plane hijacking ended in a hundred deaths because the terrorists were somehow able to anticipate the authorities\u2019 counter-attack. And he is still heartbroken because his CIA colleague Celia Harrison (Thandiwe Newton), with whom he was and is deeply in love, broke up with him just afterwards, abandoned the service and is now a placidly contented wife and mother in Carmel, California.Now Henry\u2019s hardbitten station chief Vic Wallinger (Laurence Fishburne) tells him there is evidence they had a mole \u2013 and Henry is now tasked with the emotionally painful duty of reopening the wounds and interviewing the suspects, including the shifty and evasive operative Bill (Jonathan Pryce) who is these days in semi-retirement, muttering resentfully into his whisky in a London pub. But Henry also has to travel to Carmel to ask Celia out to a restaurant to interrogate her over dinner. And Vic doesn\u2019t want loose ends or official inquiries: if Celia\u2019s answers are unsatisfactory, Henry has Vic\u2019s authority to terminate her with extreme prejudice.The result is a complex confrontation over an Instagram-perfect meal with dizzying flashbacks to Vienna and flashbacks within flashbacks to Henry\u2019s service in Moscow 12 years before that. It is the classic Le Carr\u00e9 conflation of three different sorts of betrayal: personal, professional and patriotic. Pine and Newton handle this choreography with maturity and style; Newton particularly shows how impressive she is with the right role. All the Old Knives is released on 8 April in cinemas and on Prime Video.","508":"\u201cI\u2019m not bad, I\u2019m just drawn that way.\u201d Jessica Rabbit purred the famous line in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, but it\u2019s a plight with which the key characters in this enjoyably manic DreamWorks animation might identify. A sharp-suited wolf, a tech-wizard tarantula, a grumpy snake, a piranha with impulse control issues and a shark who happens to be a master of disguise: all are accustomed to striking fear into the hearts of those who encounter them. A career in crime was inevitable. But just at the moment when they are about to pull off their biggest job, the Bad Guys get a taste of being good. And, thanks to a saintly guinea pig voiced by Richard Ayoade, they might just have a chance at rehabilitation.Like Roger Rabbit, the pacing owes a debt to the demented frenzy of classic Looney Tunes animations, but the film also nods to heist movies, notably the Oceans series. It\u2019s deliberately preposterous \u2013 the disguises are rarely more convincing than the kind of false nose and moustache combo you might find in a cracker. But there\u2019s a kernel of believability where it matters: in the easy repartee and fully fleshed friendships. It\u2019s sharp, silly and frequently very funny.","509":"After her wonderfully engrossing feature debut, Only You, writer-director Harry Wootliff turns to a rather more toxic relationship, balancing elements of romantic melodrama and psychological thriller in a film powered by modern gothic passions. Loosely adapted from Deborah Kay Davies\u2019s book True Things About Me, it\u2019s a disturbingly seductive (and often unexpectedly funny) portrayal of manipulation and deceit that gets right under the skin of its protagonist, brilliantly played by Ruth Wilson, who walks a tightrope between enchantment and endangerment. With great physical poise and precision, Wilson (who optioned and developed the source book) engages the audience on a visceral level, her deceptively low-key performance taking us deep inside her character\u2019s dreams, desires and insecurities.Wilson plays Kate, a somewhat tremulous thirtysomething daydreamer whose personal life has stalled and who is just about holding down a humdrum job at a benefits office in Ramsgate. When a charismatic claimant (Tom Burke) cockily asks what she\u2019s doing for lunch, Kate flirtatiously throws caution to the wind and soon finds herself in an unexpectedly erotic car-park encounter that is as thrilling as it is risky. Like Kate, we know little or nothing about her mesmerising new lover, whom she names Blond, but whose particulars (his history, his status, even his whereabouts) remain enigmatically vague. What we do know is that Kate becomes instantly addicted to his pointedly unpredictable attentions, craving his calls and his company, infatuated with his presence \u2013 all the more so in his frustratingly frequent absence.Kate\u2019s friends and family are understandably suspicious, none more so than Alison (Hayley Squires), who has been trying to fix Kate up with a suitable partner with whom to settle down. For Alison, this interloper is just another bad decision \u2013 a chaotic presence that has overtaken the needy Kate\u2019s life, clouding her senses and her judgment. \u201cSo you\u2019re going to rescue him are you?\u201d asks Alison when Kate insists that their dependence is mutual, even when Blond effectively makes off with her car. Yet whenever he reappears, the spark is rekindled, keeping alive the possibility that a better, more exciting life awaits Kate, just beyond her reach.Wootliff has described True Things as \u201ca cautionary tale of a destructive sexual relationship that is both complex and ordinary\u201d, adding that this relationship seems \u201cso familiar\u201d as to be \u201calmost a rite of passage\u201d. While Wootliff may be referring specifically to \u201ca woman\u2019s sense of self\u201d as explored or defined through relationships, the film\u2019s appealcrosses gender boundaries. Anyone who has ever defined themselves through the eyes of others, or sought self-worth in unworthy romance, will recognise both the agony and ecstasy of Kate\u2019s predicament. That tension burns at the heart of True Things, making Kate both a passive observer of and active agent in circumstances beyond her control. Crucially, no matter how much her passion devours her, it also drives her \u2013 albeit to distraction.Having brilliantly embodied the suavely duplicitous Anthony in Joanna Hogg\u2019s The Souvenir, Burke here seems to channel the spirit of Oliver Reed, investing his character with a blend of animal magnetism and fear of intimacy that feeds hungrily upon Kate\u2019s own conflicted responses. When he tells her that she\u2019s \u201clovely\u201d, there\u2019s something of the fairytale wolf about his words, as if he were preparing to eat her. Yet, like Red Riding Hood, Kate is more resourceful than she seems.In Only You, Josh O\u2019Connor and Laia Costa danced to the anguished strains of Elvis Costello\u2019s I Want You in a scene that showcased Wootliff\u2019s ability to tell a story through movement and music. Dance plays a crucial role in True Things too, as PJ Harvey\u2019s Rid of Me soundtracks a defining scene of character-driven choreography in which Wootliff and Wilson work in perfect harmony with cinematographer Ashley Connor, whose close-up expressionist images have a tactile, sensuous quality. Plaudits, too, to composer Alex Baranowski, whose plucked, processed sounds create a sonic backdrop that perfectly captures Kate\u2019s anxiously evolving spirit, simultaneously evoking impending catastrophe and ecstatic escape.","510":"There\u2019s a voice inside the head of college freshman Alex (a remarkable, physically and mentally committed Isabelle Fuhrman) that drives her. Hectoring, inescapable: this inner voice is the reason she chose to major in physics, her weakest subject, just so that she can conquer it. It\u2019s the reason that not only does she sign up for the college\u2019s novice rowing programme, she pushes herself to bleeding and breaking point to be the best, to make it into the elite varsity team. This voice, a muttered inner mantra that is as compulsive and damaging in its way as the impulse to self-harm, is integral to this stunning feature debut, contributing to the film\u2019s intriguingly textured and three-dimensional sound design. The aural component of the movie \u2013 voices flayed and torn up, bleeding into a score that at first nods to the austere traditions of the campus, before taking on a more clattering and agitated character \u2013 is foregrounded to an unusual degree. It\u2019s not surprising to learn that its writer and director, Lauren Hadaway, who based this film on her own experiences on a college rowing team, has a background in sound editing.Hadaway\u2019s sound department work includes Zack Snyder\u2019s Justice League and Quentin Tarantino\u2019s The Hateful Eight. But it\u2019s another of her credits, Damien Chazelle\u2019s Whiplash, which is the most useful reference point for The Novice. Both films are punishingly intense portraits of ambition tipping over into obsession. Both are stylistically bold and confrontational pieces of film-making. Both feature central performances which are feats of physical endurance. And both announced a significant new voice in US cinema. I can\u2019t wait to see \u2013 and hear \u2013 what she does next.","511":"Here is a cinematic adaptation of L\u00e9o Delibes\u2019 ballet that blends animation, visual effects and live-action dancing, drawing on the rejigged story and score created for a Dutch National Ballet production of the show from 2008.Like several other modern productions, this version updates to the present the 19th-century ETA Hoffman-derived story of a village boy lured away from his human sweetheart by a mechanical doll controlled by an evil genius. Instead of a lifesize wind-up toy danced by a prima ballerina, here Coppelia is imagined as an animated dancebot whose high blond beehive with flip curls recalls Lisa Marie\u2019s alien temptress from Mars Attacks! Her controller, Doctor Coppelius (Vito Mazzeo), seems to be offering his services to the townsfolk as a kind of plastic surgeon, but he\u2019s actually using brainwashing techniques to steal their human essences \u2013 strength, intelligence and something symbolised by a heart (emotional intelligence? Passion? Emoji power?) \u2013 and transfer them into Coppelia.Local juice bar jockey Swan (Michaela DePrince) works out something is seriously amiss and teams up with her corps de ballet pals to thwart Coppelius and save her true love Franz (Daniel Camargo). Semiretired ballet superstar Darcey Bussell is on hand as the town\u2019s mayor, but she is careful not to upstage DePrince, who really shines with a natural photogenic presence, strong acting skills and athletic form. The whole shooting match eschews the use of dialogue, so for all its modernist trappings it\u2019s a pretty traditional ballet production \u2013 though one that uses a lot of green screen backgrounds and digital dancers. When the latter, with their uncanny-valley features, perform alongside the human cast, the difference in expressiveness is oddly unsettling, making this feel like some insane mashup of the silent film classic Metropolis, old-school dance and the children\u2019s TV show LazyTown from the early 00s. But in a mostly fun way. Coppelia is released on 1 April in cinemas.","512":"Thoroughly researched and scrupulously balanced, this documentary, written, directed and presented by television producer Gillian Mosely (Tony Robinson\u2019s World War 1), excavates the history of the Israel-Palestine conflict and attempts to engage with both sides of a seemingly unbridgeable divide. It is sober, thought-provoking stuff which, while it relies on some fairly hackneyed soundtrack choices (Beethoven\u2019s Moonlight Sonata and other classical greatest hits), surprises and illuminates elsewhere.The fingerprints of Britain, with colonial policies that ignored common sense and human rights, can be found on a timebomb that dates back to the first world war. It is fascinating, if rather bleak, but does seem better suited to television than to a cinema release. The Tinderbox is in cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema","513":"An endless sprawl of a film set in the endless sprawl of LA, Michael Bay\u2019s Ambulance is well over two hours long, and most of the running time is taken up by \u201ca very expensive car chase\u201d, as one supporting character points out, while cop cars perform slow-mo somersaults from the freeway. A tale of two estranged brothers, Danny (a vein-popping Jake Gyllenhaal, giving arguably the most Michael Bay performance in the history of Michael Bay films) and Will (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), and a heist gone wrong, Ambulance is based on a 2005 Danish picture of the same name. The original clocked in at a lean 76 minutes, but in the hands of Bay, a long-term advocate of the maxim \u201cmore is more\u201d, the story is pumped up, steroidal and unwieldy. It\u2019s a pity, because at the core of the film, partially concealed by Bay\u2019s posturing and swagger, is a bracing, slickly executed B-movie \u2013 Danny and Will hijack an ambulance: inside is a critically injured cop and a ballsy paramedic (Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez); outside are guns, explosives and a lot of very angry law enforcement officers.","514":"Danish-born Norwegian writer-director Joachim Trier\u2019s existential tragicomedy opened to rave reviews in Cannes last year and has since garnered international awards recognition, including Oscar nominations for original screenplay (with regular co-writer Eskil Vogt) and international feature film. Described by Trier as \u201ca coming-of-age film for grownups who feel like they still haven\u2019t grown up\u201d, it continues the director\u2019s cinematic love affair with the Norwegian capital, previously explored in Reprise and Oslo, August 31st, with which this forms a loose trilogy. Blending melancholy wistfulness with unruly energy and piercing humour, it\u2019s a down-to-earth tale of love and death, boosted by a brilliantly believable central performance and elevated by fantastical moments of hallucinogenic horror and ecstatic joy.Cannes best actress winner Renate Reinsve is a revelation as Julie, a potential high-achiever with an aversion to \u201cseeing things through\u201d, whose life goals are a moving target \u2013 personal, professional and romantic. On the surface, she enjoys freedoms that her predecessors could never have imagined, forever reinventing herself as she searches for a persona that fits her psyche. Yet while 21st-century social mobility may have rewritten the rules of social engagement, the expectation of finding \u201csuccess\u201d in love remains oppressively omnipresent, heightened by the impending spectre of Julie\u2019s 30th birthday. Is her ideal partner out there waiting for her? Has she already blown her chances of happiness? And what happens when two perfectly matched people\u2019s paths cross just as their respective timelines diverge?In an interview with this paper, Reinsve noted astutely: \u201cWe asked questions when we made this movie and I feel we didn\u2019t give any answers\u201d, adding that the film was more like \u201ca big conversation\u201d than a statement. That\u2019s certainly true of her portrayal of Julie, who has the quality of being that rarest of screen beings - a work in progress. Over a couple of hours, divided in mock-literary style into 12 chapters plus prologue and epilogue, we see Julie evolve, making (often reckless) decisions, the tangible consequences of which seem to be physically absorbed into Reinsve\u2019s mesmerising performance.Thus, we watch as Julie falls for Aksel (Anders Danielsen Lie), a comic-book author several years her senior, whose down-and-dirty non-PC creations are becoming popular enough to risk being neutered for the mainstream market. They seem a happy couple despite the differing demands of their respective ages, such as whether or not to start a family. But in her daydreams Julie flies off to an assignation with Eivind (Herbert Nordrum), whom she met while gatecrashing a wedding and with whom she spends a blissful evening playfully testing the boundaries of what constitutes \u201ccheating\u201d.In his previous film, Thelma, Trier flirted with the supernatural spectre of Stephen King\u2019s Carrie, conjuring an eerie vision in which burgeoning sexuality seems to slip into telekinesis. While The Worst Person in the World may be an altogether more \u201crealist\u201d work, Trier (who inserted a clip of Dario Argento\u2019s stylish slasher Opera into his English-language film Louder Than Bombs) retains an affection for the fantastical, most notably in a breathtaking sequence in which Julie makes a cross-town dash through Oslo to spend a perfect day with Eivind, while time stands still for the city\u2019s other inhabitants.Remember the grotesquely glib time-stopped set pieces from Sean Ellis\u2019s supposedly \u201carty\u201d 2006 British rom-(non)-com Cashback? Now imagine the flipside of those misogynist interludes, as Trier perfectly captures the heady euphoria of infatuation that our heroine experiences in all its infinite beauty and sadness. No wonder a shot of Reinsve\u2019s beaming face from this sequence has become the film\u2019s defining poster image, her propulsive happiness contrasting starkly with a title that will strike a chord with anyone who has ever loved and lost and blamed themselves.Shot in sensuous 35mm by Kasper Tuxen and blessed with an anarchic spirit that at times reminded me of Maren Ade\u2019s sublimely awkward German comedy drama Toni Erdmann, this is far and away Trier\u2019s best work to date. As for Reinsve, who was on the brink of abandoning acting altogether when this role came calling, it is surely the launchpad for a remarkable screen career.","515":"It\u2019s 1990. Diplomats from North and South Korea are engaged in a bad-faith battle to jeopardise each other\u2019s chances of political allegiances with the government of Somalia. But the staff of the two rival embassies are forced to cooperate when a civil war erupts. Loosely based on true events, this propulsively entertaining political thriller bears more than a passing resemblance to Ben Affleck\u2019s Argo.The picture, a big-budget spectacle guided by the sure hand of action director Seung-wan Ryu (Crying Fist), is at its most effective when the hurtling camera is strafed by bullets. It\u2019s less successful when the headlong pace falters to allow the screenplay to hammer home its message of collaboration and tolerance. \u201cYou think,\u201d says one ambassador, weighing his words emphatically, \u201cwe can accomplish more together?\u201d For the most part, though, this is bracingly enjoyable stuff \u2013 slickly edited, dryly humorous and shot with a bold yellow palette that somehow enhances the sense of panic. Escape from Mogadishu is in cinemas and on VOD","516":"Gail Bishop is locked out of her new home. The university professor, played by Regina Hall, has recently been appointed as house \u201cmaster\u201d at the elite (and fictional) Andover College. Except the keys she has been given don\u2019t seem to work. It\u2019s an elegant metaphor in Mariama Diallo\u2019s smart debut feature about three black women - Gail, her colleague Liv Beckman (Amber Gray) and new student Jasmine (Zoe Renee) - as they each struggle to navigate the all-white institution.Two spectres haunt one of the college\u2019s dorm rooms: a \u201cwitch\u201d who was tried and hanged and Andover\u2019s first black student, who died by suicide in 1968. There are parallels between Gail and Jasmine too, who are both rattled by a series of microaggressions at the hands of their white colleagues. Diallo utilises the visual language of horror \u2013 red lighting, empty shower stalls, a gnarled hand that emerges from under the bed \u2013 to express the terror of racism and the rot of its legacy.Master is in cinemas and streaming on Amazon Prime","517":"This is a touching if a tad treacly portrait of Ady Barkan, an inspiring American activist who has the terminal neurodegenerative disease ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis AKA motor neurone disease). Filmed over several years and directed by Nicholas Bruckman, it starts with Barkan, originally a lawyer, already well into his career as a protester and campaigner, particularly on issues that affect people on low incomes. When first met he seems like a loving family man, devoted to his wife Rachael, an academic, and their adorable baby son Carl. But then he\u2019s diagnosed with ALS, and naturally everything changes. The film includes a tearful, wrenching clip he shot himself in the middle of the night after he found out and couldn\u2019t sleep for worry. His health seems to deteriorate quickly \u2013 though perhaps that\u2019s partly an effect of the cinematic compression of time. Even so, as the indominable little Carl gets bigger and stronger and the Trump administration wreaks more and more havoc on the nation and the world, Barkan gradually loses the ability to walk, talk or even breathe by himself.Amazingly, that doesn\u2019t stop him from campaigning; he shifts his focus on to the threats to public healthcare and provision for people with pre-existing conditions like himself. In a famous viral clip filmed by friend and fellow activist Elizabeth Jaff, he debates the issue with Republican senator Jeff Flake on a plane. Although he doesn\u2019t manage to persuade Flake to change his vote, the encounter triggered Barkan\u2019s Be a Hero campaign which seeks, in addition to advocating for various progressive issues, to influence potentially persuadable Republicans such as Susan Collins to vote against, say, Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s appointment to the supreme court. The struggle ends up cornering Flake in another confrontation, this time involving Ana Maria Archila in an elevator, cheered on by Barkan.Smart, funny and endearingly sweary even when he loses the power to speak without computer assistance, Barkan is a charismatic character who\u2019s easy to like, although one wonders how much the documentary crew resisted showing anything that might dent the halo the film sets round his head. At one point, Barkan talks about his own feelings of guilt for being out on the road so much and missing his children\u2019s early years (Rachael has a second child in due course); maybe it wouldn\u2019t have hurt to probe further what price people like Barkan pay for their own heroism. Not Going Quietly is released on 18 March in cinemas.","518":"Shipyard crane operator Maurice Flitcroft (Mark Rylance) is contemplating a career change. When he chances upon a game of golf while watching TV one evening, he\u2019s launched into a new world. Literally. Director Craig Roberts plonks Flitcroft into a surreal dream sequence in which the character ascends an Astroturf staircase in his dressing gown and slippers. He\u2019s flung around the world like a golf ball, dizzy with the sense of possibility.This whimsical comedy-drama tells the true story of Flitcroft, a daffy father of three, who blagged a spot in the 1976 Open championship, setting a new record for the tournament\u2019s highest ever score. Roberts finds humour in golf\u2019s topsy-turvy rules: the higher the score, the worse the game. The amateur player is a clear threat to anyone within hitting distance, but he also represents a challenge to the elitism of the sport. Undeterred by failure (and a lifetime ban), he re-enters under a fresh alias, donning a French accent and a moustache.\u201cAn open championship should be open to everyone,\u201d says Flitcroft, who has his eyes on the competition\u2019s \u00a310,000 prize. Back in the day, he promised his wife, Jean (Sally Hawkins), champagne, caviar and diamonds. At the age of 46, he\u2019s determined not to let her down. Isobel Waller-Bridge\u2019s fizzy, hopeful score bolsters the optimistic mood. Despite the inherent silliness, the actors play it straight. There\u2019s an earnestness to Rylance\u2019s performance, which encourages us to find inspiration in the underdog.","519":"After the tonal uncertainties of his English-language western flop The Sisters Brothers, French writer-director Jacques Audiard finds himself back on home ground with this intertwining tale of love and desire in the digital age. Having earned Baftas for the neo-noir The Beat That My Heart Skipped (2005) and the bone-shaking A Prophet (2010) and won the Palme d\u2019Or with the gripping Tamil-refugee drama Dheepan (2015), Audiard is in altogether more incidental spirits for this bittersweet affair, which flirts with the modern romcom genre while cheekily flipping the themes of Eric Rohmer\u2019s My Night With Maud.The imposing towers of the Olympiades, the high-rise neighbourhood in Paris\u2019s 13th arrondissement from which the film takes its French title, provide the backdrop for an elusively chaptered roundelay of stories. First, we meet \u00c9milie (Lucie Zhang), a Chinese-French science graduate who, despite her qualifications, is kicking her heels in menial jobs such as telesales and waitressing. \u00c9milie\u2019s apartment belongs to her grandmother, who has Alzheimer\u2019s and is now living in a nearby nursing home. Yet \u00c9milie rarely visits, even assuaging her guilt by asking a supposed doppelganger to act as her stand-in, convinced her gran won\u2019t know the difference. As for her mother\u2019s phone calls from Taiwan, \u00c9milie cuts them short, keeping everything at a distance.When teacher Camille (Makita Samba) presents himself at Emilie\u2019s door as a potential rent-paying flatmate, the pair almost immediately fall into bed. Emilie is smitten, the arrogant Camille less so. \u201cWe\u2019re not a couple,\u201d he says before bringing home another lover, blithely declaring that \u201cattraction fades\u201d and that: \u201cYou\u2019re in love; I\u2019m not.\u201dNext, via an apparently brief detour into the startlingly colourful sex-cam world of Amber Sweet (Jehnny Beth), we hook up with Nora (Portrait of a Lady on Fire star No\u00e9mie Merlant) who has moved from Bordeaux to pick up her studies in Paris. \u201cI can see the Seine from my window!\u201d she says delightedly before heading to class, where the younger students react dismissively to her thirtysomething presence. Later, a party wig causes Nora to be mistaken for Amber and she promptly finds herself the subject of mobile-phone-powered sex-shaming ridicule. So grotesque is the experience (which Audiard stages with near-gothic inflections) that Nora abandons her studies and becomes an estate agent, a twist that brings her into contact first with the ever-seductive Camille and then, more importantly, with Amber, who proves to be an unexpected soulmate.Audiard describes the stories of American graphic novelist Adrian Tomine from which he drew inspiration as being \u201cfilled with whimsy and melancholy\u201d. The same is true of the film, for which Audiard called upon C\u00e9line Sciamma, creator of such flawless gems as Girlhood and Petite Maman, and L\u00e9a Mysius, who made 2017\u2019s Ava, to collaborate on the screenplay. Crisply photographed by Paul Guilhaume, and presented in a romantic urban monochrome that recalls the vistas of Manhattan, this is a playfully sensuous affair that wonders what happens to slow-burn intimacy when mediated by the urgency of the online world. Mobile phones and computer screens are constant companions, bringing people together in strange and unexpected ways, whether it\u2019s the dating apps that \u00c9milie uses to feed her immediate needs or the pay-per-view porn sites through which Nora ironically finds a human connection.Crucially, there\u2019s nothing judgmental about the script, which takes pleasure in confounding technophobic expectations. While digital communication may allow everyone to live in their own isolated box, it\u2019s interesting how many of the film\u2019s most genuinely intimate moments play out at one remove. In one scene, a couple \u201csleep together\u201d thanks to the miracle of web-cam technology. In another, the thrill of a repeated declaration of love is amplified by being delivered down a door-intercom phone.Hats off to the ensemble cast for making these highly choreographed shenanigans seem as natural as they do and to French electronic music composer Erwan Castex, AKA Rone, who was joint winner of the best soundtrack award at Cannes last year and who provides the bittersweet beat to which Audiard\u2019s film skips.","520":"In a world where malicious thoughts and dark memories can morph into fearsome monsters that wreak havoc on society, the future of the human species is bleak. Such is the premise of this prequel to the hugely popular manga and anime series Jujutsu Kaisen, which follows eccentric sorcerers vowing to protect humanity against these deadly curses. Bloody, action-packed and tragicomic all at once, this dazzling coming-of-age tale masterfully contemplates the knotty process of coming to terms with past traumas through a horror-fantasy lens.The beautiful Tokyo Jujutsu high school, where young sorcerers are trained in the art of exorcism, is once again the central setting. The timid Yuta has just enrolled as a student, and, haunted by his love for his late childhood friend Rika, he is dogged by her spirit, which has taken the form of a monstrous worm-like creature that attacks anyone who wishes him harm. In learning how to harness this energy\/curse, Yuta encounters many familiar faces from the series: among them his dashing and goofy mentor Satoru Gojo and the taciturn Toge Inumaki who only communicates in riceball ingredients, since his words have the power to kill.Just as Yuta slowly loses his shyness and sharpens his magical abilities, he and his new friends come face to face with the powerful trickster Suguru Geto, an ex-Jujutsu student with an evil plan to extinguish all non-sorcerers from the Earth. The gorgeous animation is at full throttle during this adrenaline-pumping showdown between good and evil, as a web of painstakingly detailed monsters of all kinds spring into gory action. Bolstered by an electrifying score, this cathartic ode to the triumph of love is a treat for ardent fans and newcomers alike. Jujutsu Kaisen 0 is released on 18 March in cinemas.","521":"Not to be confused with the half-dozen or so other films with the same (or similar) name, this brisk but effective drama offers a timely reminder of just how hard it is to cross borders, especially into countries that might not want you there. This Europa premiered last year, when the conversation about immigration focused mainly on those fleeing war-ravaged or even just unstable places in the Middle East or Africa. Such immigrants were far more likely to be met with hostility at Europe\u2019s edges than the compassion the west is currently extending to refugees from Ukraine, so that sheer accident of the release schedule throws this film into a whole new light. Viewers can\u2019t but fail to be aware of the discrepancy between how two different sets of people have been treated but hopefully the attention on those fleeing Russian aggression will help us all to have more understanding for people like Kamal (Adam Ali) the Iraqi protagonist of this story, who is first met trying to cross the border between Turkey and Bulgaria on a moonlit night along with several others from different countries.An opening block of contextualising prose lays out the fact that the corrupt guides that migrants pay for help are actually in cahoots with police and civilian militias who violently hunt down border-crossers. Consequently, the film plays almost like some horrible dystopian-themed first-person adventure game with a constricted field of vision (not unlike Oscar-winning Holocaust drama Son of Saul), as the camera hovers next to the panicked, perpetually-in-motion Kamal. The camera even follows him as he scrambles up a tree to hide and sees another man killed in cold blood right below him.Later, in a quite extraordinary scene shown intentionally without subtitles, an injured Kamal manages to flag down a passing motorist (Svetlana Yancheva) and persuades her to give him a lift to the hospital. The camera flicks back and forth between their faces as she listens to a radio broadcast in Bulgarian and suddenly becomes repulsed and angry with Kamal, seemingly afraid of what she has just heard, and throws him out of the car. These extraordinary visuals are enhanced by beautifully composed and balanced sound design, that mixes human noises off, the sound of birds (listen for the woodpecker) and the natural world, constantly underscored by Kamal\u2019s strained breathing.While writer-director Haider Rashid\u2019s film-making is bravura stuff indeed, as a piece of storytelling it comes up a little short. We hardly know anything about the protagonist apart from the fact that he\u2019s Iraqi, a fast runner and fond of songs with lyrics about mother love, and the ambiguous ending feels a bit flat. Nevertheless this is an intense and empathic work that deserves to be seen. Europa is released on 18 March in cinemas and on digital platforms.","522":"This grisly black comedy will do nothing to dispel the old cliche about France being a nation of steak-frites-devouring meat-eaters. It\u2019s the story of husband-and-wife butchers who become serial killers \u2013 making vegans into mincemeat, literally. It is a slight, lightweight film, gruesomely hilarious in places, with one or two echoes of the Coen brothers\u2019 Fargo.Giving nicely deadpan performances, Marina Fo\u00efs and director Fabrice Ebou\u00e9 play unhappily married butchers Sophie and Vincent, who are looking down the barrel of bankruptcy and divorce when they accidentally kill a vegan activist. Naturally, they dispose of his body using the tools of their trade. But then Sophie unwittingly puts the human meat on the shelves \u2013 and it\u2019s an instant hit with customers (\u201cI\u2019ve never tasted anything like it!\u201d). So the pair start bumping off vegans to sell as specialist pork. The only problem is maintaining their supply of human ham.What follows is a series of farcical scenes \u2013 that are somewhat repetitive, to be honest \u2013 in which the pair pretend to be animal rights activists to lure victims. The trouble is, vegans tend to be on the skinny side \u2013 what\u2019s needed are chunkier victims. Vincent says no to a chubby nine-year-old, because he draws the line at butchering kids, so Sophie (she\u2019s the ruthless one) tries to persuade him: \u201cBut veal is the best of all!\u201dSome Like It Rare is a tasty treat for herbivores and carnivores alike, and it honestly doesn\u2019t feel like an anti-vegan film (but then, I\u2019m only vegetarian). There are one or two sanctimonious vegan characters, but the nastiest piece of work here is an arrogant, casually racist multimillionaire butcher. If anything, the sight of Vincent and Sophie feeding a human hand into the meat grinder is enough to put you off flesh for life, whatever the variety. Some Like It Rare is released on 21 March on digital platforms.","523":"Gordon Shaw is a Scottish artist and comic book creator who was diagnosed with a brain tumour in his early 30s; this documentary shows him coming to terms with his condition by transforming it into graphic art, an open-ended autobiographical project which takes the form of zines, pictures and exhibitions.Shaw has the inspired idea of taking the notorious buzzing and deafening clangs experienced by people undergoing an MRI scan and converting these sounds into an electronic musical event, which people would experience from within a scanner-style enclosure. (\u201cIt\u2019s horizontal techno, but of course you can\u2019t dance!\u201d) He calls his tumour \u201cRick\u201d (the way Dennis Potter called his cancer \u201cRupert\u201d after Rupert Murdoch, but \u201cRick\u201d doesn\u2019t seem to be anyone he dislikes) and this film shows him fighting the growth with humour and honesty.This is a film with its own artless, almost amateur kind of video-diary directness, and Shaw himself has a childlike kind of smileyness and fun. And his trials are made even more challenging by the fact that his partner Shawn lives in the United States: Shaw\u2019s condition makes it difficult for him to travel out there to see him \u2013 and then Covid arrives, making it difficult for Shawn to come over. Towards the end of the film, with the clinical news getting worse, Shaw addresses the camera directly in his flat (seated just next to a Bill Hicks cushion) and speaks with candour about what his choices are right now. It would have been interesting to hear more from Shaw about the work itself, and from his audience about what they get out of the imagery. But this is a tender portrait. Long Live My Happy Head is released on 18 March in cinemas.","524":"This is a quietly promising Irish Gaelic-language drama that features strong work from D\u00f3nall \u00d3 H\u00e9alai as John, a handsome neurodivergent loner in the Connemara mountains who defies the expected categories: neither a victim, nor a holy fool. Gauche and often monosyllabic, he\u2019s also quickly amused, embarrassingly horny and possessed of a solidity that seems to emanate from the land itself.Twenty-eight-year-old John finds himself marooned in the adult world and in desperate need of direction when his mother dies suddenly. The \u201clittle God\u201d, as a family friend puts it, raised by his parents is barely able to look after himself \u2013 let alone deal with being pestered by a local entrepreneur keen to scoop up his family\u2019s land in order to put a windfarm there. After being beaten senseless by a local oik jealous of John\u2019s supposed riches, he winds up on long hospital convalescence \u2013 and excited to be in regular close physical contact with nurse Siobh\u00e1n (Fionnuala Flaherty).Writer-director Se\u00e1n Breathnach, adapting Donal Ryan\u2019s novel The Thing About December for his second feature, opts for gently elliptical storytelling that has to lurch to join the different strands: the buy-out, the local intimidation, John\u2019s ham-fisted attempts \u2013 egged on by Dave (Cillian O\u2019Gairbhi), his hospital room-mate \u2013 to woo Siobh\u00e1n. But the narrative style does seem a close fit for John\u2019s off-kilter consciousness, and enables some striking cinematography; not just the sodden landscapes, but pathos-laden closeups such as the orphan\u2019s eclipsed moon of a face at the funeral.If Foscadh flirts with and finally swerves a hackneyed rural-tragic destiny in its final quarter, its ending feels like something of a compromise \u2013 and it\u2019s a pity that Flaherty, as John\u2019s sharp-tongued lover\/surrogate mother, is out of the picture by then. But \u00d3 H\u00e9alai fills the main character with a squirming, unabashed lust for life. Foscadh (Shelter) is released in cinemas on 11 March.","525":"Finnish director Mika Kaurism\u00e4ki (elder brother of Aki Kaurism\u00e4ki) gives us a well-intentioned if watery and bland drama, a decently performed but tepid heartwarmer which can be filed under that dodgiest of sub-headings: \u201cfoodie\u201d, that is, something with a supercilious tendency to showcase delicious-seeming food as a shortcut to being life-affirming and life-enhancing.A Chinese widower called Cheng (played by Hong Kong actor Pak Hong Chu) shows up out of the blue in a remote Finnish town with his young son Niu Niu (Lucas Hsuan), and walks into a roadside cafe run by Sirkka (Anna-Maija Tuokko), who is listlessly serving up dull grub for the locals. With no Finnish and only halting English, Cheng asks everyone in the place if they know of \u201cFongtron\u201d: this mysterious person or business is the reason he\u2019s here. No one can help (and weirdly, it doesn\u2019t occur to anyone to use Google Translate to help with their communication difficulties).Well, Sirrka lets Cheng and his boy stay in a room in her house and, to pay her back, Cheng offers to cook delicious Chinese food for the Chinese tourists who at the moment are deterred from spending their cash in her place because of the unappetising slop she\u2019s offering. Cheng turns out to be a professional chef in Shanghai, with a terribly sad reason for being in Finland. Cheng\u2019s food is a runaway hit, and there\u2019s a spark between him and Sirrka.This is a reasonable enough film, though underpowered, and the truth about \u201cFongtron\u201d is very perfunctorily revealed and then dismissed. And then there\u2019s the lovingly slow, pointless shots of the food itself, especially over the closing credits. Where\u2019s the bite? Master Cheng is released on 11 March in cinemas.","526":"Blending the grand visuals of a sweeping epic with the psychological unease of a chamber piece, Charlotte Sieling\u2019s feature probes the legacy of Denmark\u2019s Queen Margrete, a visionary ruler who brokered the historic Kalmar Union that \u2013 for the first time \u2013 united Norway, Sweden and Denmark against the threat of a German invasion.But her reign also saw a bizarre mystery in the Scandinavian region, which forms the emotional beating heart of this stately film. On the eve of the engagement between Margrete\u2019s adopted son Erik (Morten Hee Andersen), and Princess Philippa (Diana Martinov\u00e1), daughter of England\u2019s Henry IV, news broke that the Queen\u2019s biological son King Olaf (Jakob Oftebro) had returned from the dead. This sudden arrival not only unsettled political coalitions but also sent the usually stoic Margrete into a state of distress. Since she was not at his side when Olaf died, her maternal grief encouraged her to believe that Olaf had survived. On the other hand, her monarchical rationality questioned if he was merely an impostor sent to her doorsteps to disrupt a sought-after alliance with England.Much of this emotional tug-of-war is played out in atmospherically lit indoor compositions, which evoke a painterly, classical feel. What elevates the film from a run-of-the-mill period drama is Trine Dyrholm\u2019s masterfully understated performance as the tormented queen. Her Margrete has no need to shout and weep to convey her turmoil; a mere gaze is enough to articulate the dilemma of having to put collective needs over personal desires. While the plot is at times overstuffed with palace intrigues, this piercing character study carries a contemporary poignancy, as it encapsulates the difficult choices a female leader has to make in a world bounded by patriarchal control. Margrete: Queen of the North is released 14 March on digital platforms.","527":"The release of a new Pixar film, once a major, all-attention-securing event, has received a notable downgrade in recent years, not just because of a considerable dip in quality (arguably just Inside Out and Coco are the only indispensable offerings in the last decade) but because of an inevitable change in release strategy. Just a month before the pandemic truly took hold, the fantasy caper Onward (yet another underwhelming effort) became one of the only 2020 films to get a wide theatrical release and as everything shuttered, Pixar\u2019s next two films \u2013 Soul and Luca \u2013 levelled down to premieres on Disney+ even though the latter was released at a time when cinemas were fully operational again.It\u2019s a little odd that their latest, Turning Red, will also follow suit given the healthy state of the box office (a bright and zippy pre-spring Pixar adventure would have surely been a hit), but yet another sign of Disney\u2019s bullish attempt to out-Netflix Netflix by forcing even the vaguest of fans on to its ever-growing streaming service. It\u2019s also, perhaps, a self-aware demotion for another under-par film, one that\u2019s not without merits and the occasional biggish swing, but a far cry from the partnership\u2019s wildly inventive heyday. What once felt organic has come to feel far too over-calculated from the wacky but-wait-what-if set-up to the but-wait-it\u2019s-actually-really-about allegory and coming out less than a year after Luca, which had a similar transformation narrative, Turning Red feels like factory line Pixar.But it\u2019s worth stating that in an ever-saturated landscape for children\u2019s animation, factory line Pixar is still much more proficient than most (excusing last year\u2019s thrilling Netflix caper The Mitchells vs the Machines which had a similar \u201cbe your weird self\u201d message) and there are enough high-colour highlights here to enrapture younger audiences while keeping elders at least somewhat involved, and at times directly spoken to, at the same time.Toronto-set Turning Red turns back the clock to 2002 to focus on 13-year-old high-achiever Mei Lee (voiced by Rosalie Chiang), whose close kinship with her three best friends is forever pushed into second place by her demanding yet loving mother (voiced by Sandra Oh). Trying to juggle both sides of her life becomes even more challenging when Mei Lee discovers that one day, any extreme emotional state, otherwise known as having hormones, turns her to a giant red panda. It\u2019s rather awkward given the chaos of her adolescence but initial horror soon turns into something more manageable when she discovers the upsides of her new condition.There\u2019s an all-too-recent whiff of the aforementioned Luca as well as elements of Brave from 2012 and Inside Out three years later; like those films, we\u2019re dealing with the pains of youth and how growing up affects the family dynamic as reflected via an outlandish conceit. Playwright Julia Cho and co-writer-director Domee Shi have at least tried to add some specificity to the dog-eared formula as well as bravely, for the territory, confronting the less historically Disney-friendly elements of the experience. When Mei Lee first turns into the red panda, her mother assumes that the behind-the-bathroom-door panic is down to her first period and while it really shouldn\u2019t have to be seen as a big deal, for Disney (a studio still playing coy over the existence of LGBTQ people in their live-action, let alone animated, films), it\u2019s a medium-sized step and it\u2019s handled without any expected bashfulness. Mei Lee and her friends are also proud fans of the N*Sync-aping boyband 4*Town and one of her triggers is the feelings they arouse within her, another step toward realising the teenage experience has more nuance than the studio has ever been willing to admit.Like other recent Disney and Disney-Pixar films, Turning Red also does away with both love interest and villain and while the absence of the former remains rewarding (friendship again trumps romance here), there\u2019s a dearth of genuine conflict. The mother-daughter dynamic is deftly avoidant of broad strokes (it\u2019s far more layered and loving than strictness v rebellion) but it\u2019s not quite enough to power the film as it heads to a big set-piece finale. Like Luca before it, Turning Red also takes a nifty idea and coerces it into a less nifty narrative \u2013 the girls must monetise the panda to raise money for a concert \u2013 and flashes of ingenuity become dulled by the more plodding main plot. There\u2019s also something a little too box-ticking about the period setting, which is never truly justified as anything other than an attempt to appeal to millennial parents who can point and exclaim \u201cThat\u2019s Bootylicious!\u201d when Bootylicious plays, nostalgia for nostalgia\u2019s sake. What works far better are the boyband\u2019s songs, crafted by Billie Eilish and Finneas, which are sleek enough to pass as N*Sync-alike earworms.The journey is slick and diverting, and at times incisive, but Turning Red is yet another Pixar film that coasts rather than glides. Hopefully its next offering can turn into something more.Turning Red is available on Disney+ from 11 March and is released on 9 February in UK and Irish cinemas.","528":"That definite article means it\u2019s the genuine article. Adding \u201cthe\u201d to Batman\u2019s name has become a huge part of the brand identity, a sign of how elemental and atavistic this shadowy figure is supposed to be. You can imagine some growly voice saying \u201cthe Batman\u201d \u2013 but not Tom Holland putting on a deep baritone to say he\u2019s \u201cthe Spider-Man\u201d, or Henry Cavill booming he\u2019s \u201cthe Superman\u201d (although maybe you could have Billy Joel stride into a dark Gotham City bar to raspingly confront \u201cthe Piano Man\u201d).Director and co-writer Matt Reeves has created a new Batman iteration in which Robert Pattinson reinvents billionaire Bruce Wayne as an elegantly wasted rock star recluse, willowy and dandyish in his black suit with tendrils of dark hair falling over his face; but Wayne magically trebles in bulk when he reappears in costume and mask as the Dark Knight, his whole being weaponised into a slab-like impassivity. And this of course is happening in the sepulchral vastness of Gotham City, the brutal and murky world which Christopher Nolan thrillingly pioneered with his Dark Knight trilogy and made indispensable for imagining Batman on screen.Intriguingly at first, The Batman feels like a serial killer chiller such as Saw. For a time it promises a mystery plot relating to the theme of municipal corruption which is so important to the Batman franchise, and holds out hope of an unmasking with a satisfying narrative resolution. But not really. It is tremendously designed, visually spectacular with great set pieces and juddering, sternum-shivering impacts coming at you out of the darkness. There are unassumingly good performances from Jeffrey Wright and John Turturro, and Zo\u00eb Kravitz\u2019s superpower is charisma. But the film is overlong; the Riddler\u2019s puzzles aren\u2019t particularly ingenious or even important to the story and there\u2019s a pretty feeble non-ending which sheepishly sidesteps The Batman\u2019s existential crisis.Gotham City\u2019s political classes are complacently congratulating themselves on rooting out a major drug dealer, Sal Maroni. But the city is still drenched in crime and addiction to a new narcotic called \u201cdrops\u201d, to which law enforcement is clearly turning a blind eye. Most exercised about this is the Riddler (Paul Dano), sporting a rubber gimp mask for his many social media appearances. He sets out to whack the corrupt Gotham establishment one by one, including Mayor Don Mitchell (Rupert Penry-Jones) and district attorney Gil Colson (Peter Sarsgaard), leaving quibbling questions for the Batman on Hallmark-type cards at the scene of each gruesome crime. So our antihero effectively joins forces with commissioner Gordon (Wright, lending his innate dignity and integrity to the role) to take down the Riddler, incidentally putting himself up against mob boss Carmine Falcone (Turturro) and his bloated sidekick Oswald \u201cThe Penguin\u201d Cobblepot (Colin Farrell) who don\u2019t like questions being asked about who is doing the corrupting.But wait. The Riddler is obsessed above all with what he says is the most grotesquely crooked thing about Gotham City: the plutocrat Wayne family and Bruce\u2019s late father who made fraud and crime the city\u2019s foundation stone. The Riddler longs to kill Bruce Wayne. And the Batman is beginning to wonder \u2026 could the Riddler have a point?The Batman has some people in his corner. Kravitz is stylish and assured as cat burglar Selina Kyle, or Catwoman, who has reasons of her own for detesting creepy Falcone. There is a nice sequence when Bruce gives Selina some surveillance contact lenses to wear before she sashays through Carmine\u2019s club, making eye contact with the cringing regulars, while Wayne monitors it all on a screen.Andy Serkis plays Wayne\u2019s butler Alfred, a loyal plain-speaking fellow who has apparently done time in the \u201ccircus\u201d: meaning the John Le Carr\u00e9 intelligence world, not the actual circus, although it\u2019s confusing given the Cirque du Soleil stylings all the combatants are going in for.But the ending is tiresome and shark-jumping in the extreme, with faux-apocalyptic scenes which work better in less solemn superhero adventures, and an exasperating non-revelation whose significance is teased for the next film. Inevitably, night falls on the latest Batman iteration with the cloudy sense that \u2013 of course \u2013 nothing has really been at stake. A classy turn from Pattinson, however, as the crime fighter with an injured soul. The Batman is released on 3 March in Australia, and 4 March in the US and UK.","529":"\u201cShe wasn\u2019t a genius,\u201d says one talking-head commentator early on in Lucy and Desi, Amy Poehler\u2019s new bio-doc tribute to the illustrious creative partnership between the sitcom\u2019s queen and king, Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. That sounds like a swipe out of joint with the film\u2019s overall attitude of soft-focus hagiography, but it\u2019s meant as a testament to her indefatigable self-starter ethic. Ball\u2019s success wasn\u2019t effortless, we\u2019re told, due to some innate talent she could activate as she pleased. Far from a God-given gift, her rubber-faced comedic chops were honed over years of teeth-cutting and stripe-earning on stage. Everything she had \u2013 the fame, the fortune, a seat at the head of the table in the largest independent studio in Hollywood \u2013 she got by working herself to the bone.It\u2019s easy to see why Ball would be an aspirational figure for someone like Poehler, a fellow female comedian who triumphed over a male-dominated showbiz architecture by making a spectacular fool of herself on a weekly basis. Her assertive confidence behind the scenes, coupled with a bold un-self-seriousness at a time when the feminine ideal was that of the domestic goddess, made her a role model to a generation of cut-ups including Carol Burnett and Bette Midler. They both sit for Poehler\u2019s camera to sing the praises of their idol, adding their voices to a chorus of adulation that drowns out everything else. The evident bounty of affection for Ball, however well-founded, doesn\u2019t just leave Arnaz as a supporting character in this ostensible double portrait. It lends the whole production the syrupy taste of PR, like we\u2019re watching a special-feature supplement on the home-video release of Being the Ricardos. (Surely not coincidentally, both titles are Amazon properties.)Those approaching the documentary as an opportunity to spend 100 minutes poring over rare archival footage of Ball and Arnaz will find their low bar amply met. Zippy montages of home movies or photographs paired with preserved audio, often whisked along by hooray-for-Hollywood hot jazz, walk us through the beats of the couple\u2019s early years. She was a pathological entertainer who muscled her way through Vaudeville and B-movies; he was a Cuban refugee from the Batista regime (the politics of which are addressed so fleetingly that it only serves to create confusion) bringing the conga line to America as a high-energy bandleader in Miami. Theirs was a publicity romance turned real, and then transformed back into fiction once CBS offered to turn her radio show into a TV series and she demanded her real-life husband join her onscreen.I Love Lucy forever enshrined their union in the public imagination and made them the flawed, relatable antidote to the perfectly pressed household ideal of Leave It to Beaver. But their success also began to drive a wedge between them that would end in divorce. He didn\u2019t always enjoy being at the helm of the business while she, the funny one to his straight man, ascended to the highest tiers of stardom. Cranking out 41 episodes over 41 weeks left them with little time to spend together, a situation not helped by Arnaz\u2019s womanizing, which the film restricts to a brief mention. Poehler instead focuses on the long-standing respect and the love that never extinguished even after their split, allowing the acrimony to be present while relegating it to the background. As unimaginative a conclusion as it might be, watching Arnaz\u2019s posthumous letter to his former wife recited at the Kennedy Center Honors nonetheless ends things on a tear-jerking note.More than any canniness in its arrangement, the film benefits from having a lot of watchable raw material to work with. Its most edifying insights pertain to how the couple\u2019s production company, Desilu, revolutionized the way TV was made. Arnaz had the bright idea of adding a live studio audience to the multi-camera setup to capture the crackle of live performance, and essentially invented the next 50 years of small-screen comedy. Ball worked her real-life pregnancy into the scripts, a first in an era that preferred to leave such bodily matters undiscussed, and her resultant maternity leave led to Arnaz\u2019s innovation of the rerun. One genuinely moving, inspired moment connects Ball\u2019s expert character work to a compassion for humanity, suggesting that she learned fluency in shtick by taking an interest in strangers\u2019 mannerisms everywhere she went.Yet their achievements along professional lines always lead back to the easily agreed-upon assertion that Ball was a great performer and human being, and that she and Arnaz were each other\u2019s lifelong muse. Though the clips of our old pals Lucy and Desi muster the pathos required to pull off these bids for sentimentality, as a work unto itself, the film is just the latest in a long line of pedestrian paint-by-numbers canonizations for Boomer-beloved icons of the 20th century\u2019s latter half. For all the amazement at Ball\u2019s tireless hustle and explosive originality, there\u2019s a terminal lack of both in this monument to her memory.Lucy and Desi is available on Amazon Prime on 4 March","530":"This ambitious French sci-fi parable has some quiet moments of beauty and poignancy, but otherwise it\u2019s a long slog \u2013 and so bombastic, jejune and ill-considered that it feels far more drawn out than the 87 minutes running time would suggest. In writer-director Romain Quirot\u2019s vision of the future, humanity has worked out how to mine an inexhaustible power supply from an astral object that happens to wander by; it is called, unimaginatively, \u201cthe red moon\u201d. This heavenly body appears to be like the living, sentient planet in Stanislaw Lem\u2019s novel Solaris (a book adapted twice, by Andrei Tarkovsky and Steven Soderbergh), and our hero Paul WR (Hugo Becker) can somehow sense that the red moon is quite cross with us earthlings for some reason.That would appear to be why he refuses to fly a mission to destroy the approaching lunar body, even though, in a frankly silly plot move, he is the only person in the world that can possibly do it. Likewise, the script is vague about whether the Earth has become one huge desert that resembles Morocco because of the red moon or just due to the climate meltdown we\u2019re already experiencing. First-time director Quirot is clearly more interested in making points about the dysfunctional family dynamics Paul grew up with: a mum who died when he was young, a distracted science genius dad (Jean Reno, wasted here). There\u2019s also an older brother named Eliott (Paul Hamy) who uses his psychic powers to persuade people to kill themselves.Instead of the big mission, Paul goes on the run to search for a mysterious forest for no very clear reason. He teams up with a pretty, gamine young woman (Lya Oussadit-Lessert) who he meets at a rest stop where he tries to get a new battery for his electric hover car. These cars, you see, are supposed to float above the ground thanks to the mysterious energy source harvested from the red moon. They look good in the VFX long shots but Quirot never explains why they rock around when they\u2019re driving, just like any old banger with four wheels would. The inattention to detail is what makes this feel like a triumph of style over content, and not in a good way. The Last Journey is available on 7 March on digital platforms.","531":"Fifteen miles to the south-east of Denali, the highest peak in North America, lies a colossal mountain range that rears from the ground like a vertiginous jaw. Fittingly, the various summits of this natural wonder are called Moose\u2019s Tooth, Eye Tooth, Sugar Tooth and Broken Tooth. While many explorers have conquered each of these peaks, none have attempted a lateral climb from summit to summit,akin to walking atop the skyline. But a black-and-white aerial photograph of the forbidding path, all snow-capped and wrapped in billowy clouds, beckons the adventurous spirit of mountaineers Renan Ozturk, Freddie Wilkinson and Zach Smith.Directed by Ozturk and Wilkinson, this awe-inspiring documentary is as much about their years-long attempts to scale the Tooth traverse as it is about Brad Washburn, the man behind the image that ignited their curiosity. A daring figure with an inexhaustible passion for exploration, Washburn pioneered the use of aerial photography in cartography, crafting superbly detailed maps of regions previously neglected by geographers. The extraordinary milestones of Washburn\u2019s career \u2013 including his tenure as the director of the Boston Museum of Science \u2013 are interwoven with the highs and lows in the three climbers\u2019 private lives. Despite the deaths of fellow mountaineers, neck-breaking accidents and financial struggles, their determination to scale the traverse is staggering in its unshakeable resilience. And amid perilous risks of avalanche and falling rocks, their enthusiasm has a childlike wonder that feels especially moving.While the juxtaposition of different timelines results in occasional clunkiness, the breathtaking cinematography more than makes up for the uneven telling. In the face of global climate change, these images of the glacial otherworldliness of Alaska carry a wistful splendour and a bittersweet urgency. The Sanctity of Space is released on 4 March in cinemas.","532":"The estimable Dave Grohl of the Foo Fighters has bafflingly decided to try everyone\u2019s patience with this insufferable vanity project: a violent gonzo grossout that sadly conforms to the horror-comedy tendency of being neither properly scary nor properly funny. And it\u2019s founded on the assumption that these real-life badass rock musicians are also pretty hilarious and adorable.In this alternative universe, the Foo Fighters are creatively blocked: we see them sitting around the boardroom table in their record company offices, listlessly bickering. So the irascible corporate suit (Jeff Garlin, phoning it in) sends them to a notorious semi-derelict house with all sort of freaky associations with rock legends of the past, there to work on their new album. It was apparently last used by a troubled band called Dreamwidow, who were tipped to be \u201cthe next Jane\u2019s Addiction\u201d. Grohl becomes haunted by the place\u2019s devilish spirits, increasingly obsessed with his own freaky otherworldly vision for the record, as more and more violent and demonic things keep happening.Will Forte has a small role as the fast-food delivery guy who keeps trying to get Dave to listen to his demo tape. Bad idea. Grohl himself is at least reasonably relaxed, as the band\u2019s much-loved frontman, finally in dire need of exorcism. But there is an awful lot of terrible wooden acting from everyone else, together with sub-Ghostbusters visual effects, for which the movie expects fanbase forgiveness. It does in fact contain one genuinely funny thing, and that is Lionel Richie\u2019s cameo. But it is really quite disconcerting that the film\u2019s comedy setup is about violent and horrible things that happened back in the 90s \u2026? Some of which concerns a person taking their own life \u2026? As Lionel Richie would say: hello? Studio 666 is released on 25 February in cinemas.","533":"Following the critically acclaimed Dearest Sister, Laos\u2019s first female director, Mattie Do, has crafted another enigmatic tale that sets itself apart from the usual horror fare, offering plenty of genre pleasures while retaining an arthouse aesthetic. In an impoverished Laotian village, an unnamed farmer (Yannawoutthi Chanthalungsy) leads a near-hermit-like existence. His daily rituals involve scavenging for metal scraps, which he sells for little money. His reticent demeanour, however, betrays none of his discontent.Yet, just as secrets lie beneath the landscape, he has skeletons in his closet. He is haunted by his mother\u2019s death from severe lung disease, and while people whisper about his ability to speak to the dead, no one knows that, since his childhood encounter with a ghost, he has taken it upon himself to relieve dying women of their suffering by euthanising them. As their apparitions wander for eternity, these spectres embody his own inability to break free of the past.The film takes place in a near future where the government injects everyone with a surveillance chip, but the otherworldly plot is grounded by exacting characterisation. Chanthalungsy is astounding in his portrayal of a man so consumed with regret that his humanity slowly shreds away. Enthralled by his new ability to travel back in time to influence the course of his mother\u2019s passage into the next life, he is blind to how his interventions result in frightening consequences.Blurring the line between good intentions and selfishness, The Long Walk is a chilling and wholly original exploration of destructive human desires. The Long Walk is released on 28 February on digital platforms.","534":"Swiss film-maker and former social worker Fred Baillif has created this pressure-cooked realist drama about a group of teen girls in a care home, where there is something more dysfunctional and tragic about the supervising staff than about the inmates themselves. Lora (Claudia Grob) is the director of this residential institution, a tough veteran of the system. Under her wing are troubled girls including Audrey (Ana\u00efs Uldry), Pr\u00e9cieuse (Joyce Esther Ndayisenga) and Justine (Charlie Areddy). Each of them is acting out, each has been abused in some way, but they find love and solidarity in this home: for them it is la famille, slangily shortened to la mif, equivalent, perhaps, to \u201cthe fam\u201d.But from the very outset, it is Lora herself who is in serious trouble: she is officially reprimanded for allowing a situation to happen whereby one of the girls, at 17, has sex with a 14-year-old boy who has been allowed to visit with others for a party. She incautiously opens up to one of the girls about an unthinkably painful thing in her own life, and when this same girl spitefully throws this information back in Lora\u2019s face during a later row, Lora\u2019s drinking problem begins to resurface; she slaps one of the abusive mothers who insults her, having been unlawfully demanding to see her daughter at the home \u2013 and things spiral out of control from there.Each of the girls is introduced with a different \u201cchapter\u201d style section, and the action repeatedly rewinds to a specific and familiar point, though without any very startling difference or viewpoint-shift revelation. The energy between the girls is something that French cinema can do very well \u2013 I thought of C\u00e9line Sciamma\u2019s Bande de Filles, but also Sarah Gavron\u2019s Rocks). It is acted largely by nonprofessional newcomers and unscripted scenes have been allowed to unspool through improvisation and shaped in the edit. This is an engaging ensemble piece, acted with vehemence and sincerity, though it concludes a little melodramatically. La Mif is released on 25 February in cinemas.","535":"This scrappy, rough-around-the-edges documentary from Norway is directed by two friends and began after one of them, Petter Aaberg, attempted to kill himself. It\u2019s a fly-on-the-wall study of Aaberg and four other young Norwegians struggling with their mental health. It is raw and intense, and also troubling in places: Aaberg and Kvamme keep the camera rolling on these vulnerable people in moments of crisis, testing the limits of documentary ethics.One of their subjects is Monica, whose arms are horrifically scarred by self-harm. A sexual abuse survivor, she lives in a constant state of hyper-vigilance. We see her having a panic attack in the street after hearing a car backfire. Monica introduces the directors to Emma, her trans friend who is struggling with the agonisingly long wait for surgery. Another subject is heroin addict Cornelia, who is filmed injecting herself and being rushed to hospital, her umpteenth overdose. I wasn\u2019t convinced that showing moments such as this, honest and hard-hittingly intimate as they are, take us any closer to understanding Monica, Emma or Cordelia.In fact, the person we watch most is co-director Aaberg: his story monopolises the film in a way that some viewers may find narcissistic. But his openness and vulnerability, his willingness to say exactly whatever he is feeling in the moment, is disarming. He starts a relationship with another woman, Miriam, and there\u2019s a scene of two of them having sex which is filmed with huge sensitivity; it\u2019s genuinely not exploitative.As the film progresses, it\u2019s clear the relationship between the directors and their subjects has developed into friendship. Aaberg and Kvamme talk in an interview about the agreement they had with their subjects, who could pull out at any point and had approval on the final cut of the film. Is it enough? Do they cross the line? I wasn\u2019t sure. Young & Afraid is available on 25 February on True Story.

Here she is intense in an understated way as a grieving mother who becomes convinced that the girl next door is her daughter, back from the dead. That reincarnation storyline is not unfamiliar, and to be honest it made my heart sink a bit at first. But this atmospheric and unsettling slowburn drama from Northern Ireland pulls it off, just.Riseborough plays a woman called Laura whose daughter Josie died several years earlier; she lives in Antrim with her husband Brendan (Jonjo O\u2019Neill) and their teenage son Tadhg (Lewis McAskie). They are a family getting on with it, bearing the unbearable. But beneath the dinner-table banter, you sense that each of them is alone with their grief. Riseborough signals Laura\u2019s loss and longing in every movement; it\u2019s there in the way she holds herself stiffly upright, like she might fall apart from heartbreak. When 10-year-old Megan (Niamh Dornan) moves in next door, Laura invites her round for tea and picks her up from school in the car. Megan appears to know things that only Josie would know, recalls places that she can\u2019t possibly have seen. Laura starts to believes she is Josie.This authentic-feeling portrait of family grief then unfolds into something more uneasy, and director Stacey Gregg whips up the mood of a horror film. There\u2019s a jangling score and unnerving camerawork: a creepy drone shot of the family\u2019s ordinary semi at the start and interiors shot in a way that makes the house feel eerie.The question of whether this is a ghost story or if Laura is experiencing a kind of psychological breakdown twists and turns in ways that lost me by the end. Still, it\u2019s is a very accomplished debut from Gregg, and acted with subtlety and sensitivity by Riseborough. Here Before is released on 18 February in cinemas.","537":"Max von Sydow, in his final film role, does what he can to lend gravitas to this odd, stilted and contrived movie, a fictional drama based on a horrendous Nazi atrocity in occupied Greece in 1943, for which the question of reparations still grumbles on. In Kalavryta in the northern Peloponnese, nearly 700 civilians were shot by the Nazi forces, in chilling reprisal for Greek resistance fighters executing 78 German soldiers taken prisoner. Von Sydow plays Nikolas, an ageing Greek writer who as a young boy miraculously escaped the massacre, but has been haunted by it ever since. In the present day, Astrid Roos plays Caroline Martin, an ambitious Berlin lawyer who is tasked by a heartless and cynical German government to go to Greece and to find details that might undermine their case for reparations.The tense occupation and slaughter of 1943 themselves are recounted in flashback, and director Nicholas Dimitropoulos makes a reasonably workmanlike job of this drama. But the film strangely insists on imagining a balancing \u201cgood German\u201d who supposedly helps the Greek women and children. It is his existence that Caroline refuses to use against the Greek government, due to that predictable crisis of conscience to which the action had been unsubtly leading from the outset. She, in effect, becomes the film\u2019s second imaginary \u201cgood German\u201d, whose behaviour is at odds with the cynical German government.Oddly, Caroline finally goes on a trip to Austria to interview the sad and saintly widow of this fictional good soldier, and she is played by Alice Krige, looking if anything younger than Von Sydow, who was supposed to be a small boy at the time. The film\u2019s one moment of real power comes when Caroline visits the real-life Museum of the Kalavrytan Holocaust and stands in front of the memorial gallery of photographs: the victims\u2019 faces. That has real substance. This film doesn\u2019t. Echoes of the Past is available on 21 February on digital platforms.","538":"Berlin juries have an interest in the confrontational and the transgressive: my guess is that this film in competition from Canadian director Denis C\u00f4t\u00e9 may well win the big prize. I am still not entirely sure how to view its exploitative aesthetic. But it\u2019s undoubtedly true that the characters and performances grow and develop, unexpectedly, into something poignant and even rather melancholy by the end.The setting is a therapeutic summer residency in a country house near a lake for young women who have issues with hypersexuality and sex addiction. They must surrender their phones (except for certain permitted breaks) and live together as a group with their mentors, with one weekend pass for the entire time; there are also activities and discussion groups. Geisha (Aude Mathieu) is a sex worker with piercings and a shaved head, and an aggressively slouching, jeering attitude; L\u00e9onie (Larissa Corriveau) was abused by her father as a child and now wishes to be humiliated and abused during group sex, often with strangers. Eug\u00e9nie (Laure Giappiconi) has similar attitudes, together with drug abuse. The group is being guided by the cool, mature detached Sami (Samir Guesmi), whom Geisha naturally tries to seduce \u2013 claiming that she\u2019s offering him a freebie, despite getting \u20ac300 a time in the sex marketplace \u2013 and to provoke him with racist remarks. Sami\u2019s colleague is the German Octavia (Anne Ratte-Polle), who has a troubled personal life and a tense, competitive professional relationship with the founder of this course: this is pregnant Mathilde (Marie-Claude Gu\u00e9rin) who is ceding responsibility to Octavia and taking this summer off for maternity leave.Scene by scene, C\u00f4t\u00e9 lays out the women\u2019s memories, their violence, their intensity, their stamina, their need to shock, or their need to show they don\u2019t care. But inevitably, a thaw sets in which we duly notice when the three women get away from the house for their weekend break. Geisha plaintively asks her boyfriend if their sex needs to be quite so porno and rough. Eug\u00e9nie offers free sex to a trucker and ends up almost simply asking to be hugged. And in the film\u2019s keynote scene of transgression, L\u00e9onie submits to some serious BDSM with her partner and then afterwards asks her man if she might possibly sleep with him in his bed and not just on the sofa.Of course, we are waiting for the ultimate contamination: sex between one or more of the girls and the adults running the group. C\u00f4t\u00e9 keeps us hanging on for that one, but Octavia is unexpectedly moved by Eug\u00e9nie\u2019s talent for drawing \u2013 and by Eug\u00e9nie herself \u2013 a revelation which might have been rather absurd, but which C\u00f4t\u00e9 manages with forthright conviction. Finally, there is a rather touching final-night \u201cparty\u201d scene and an even more wistful sequence when the girls, like innocent little kids at the summer camp, run gleefully to jump in the lake.The housekeeper, taking a motherly concern, asks Geisha if she might consider not minding quite so much about how boys look at her. It\u2019s a question that might usefully be turned towards the film-maker himself. The three woman themselves and their sexuality are arguably glamorised, and male-gazed, for all that the movie is ostensibly about their own recovery from dysfunction and abuse. Well, the performances from Mathieu, Corriveau and Giappiconi are all very good and the movie is, against the odds, rather affecting. That Kind of Summer screened at the Berlin film festival, and is released on Mubi on 1 December.","539":"The title has a double edge: it means a suit of clothes, and also the mob. US screenwriter and novelist Graham Moore won an Oscar for scripting The Imitation Game starring Benedict Cumberbatch as wartime codebreaker Alan Turing. Now he\u2019s made his directing debut with his own co-written screenplay: an amusingly contrived single-location suspense thriller, full of twist and counter-twist, set in 1950s Chicago (the city of Moore\u2019s birth). It sometimes feels like a more refined, more well-spoken and well-tailored version of Reservoir Dogs, with besuited gangsters turning guns on each other in an enclosed space and a shot tough guy seething in agony from his bullet wound. But it has a heavier tread than this: owing more, maybe, to Hitchcock\u2019s Rope.Mark Rylance provides a solid centre with a typically calm, coolly composed, quietly spoken performance, often giving us an opaque and unnerving twinkle of mischief. He plays Leonard, a British tailor who left his homeland (for shadowy reasons) with nothing but his tailor\u2019s scissors, and set up shop in Chicago. The reason he\u2019s been able to make a success of things is that he is almost solely patronised by the local gangsters: the ageing capo is Roy Boyle (Simon Russell Beale), who runs this turf with his unreliable hothead son, Richie (Dylan O\u2019Brien); Richie is snarlingly resentful that his old man now favours a smooth new lieutenant, Francis (Johnny Flynn).These bad-mannered gangsters often order fancy suits from Leonard, but use his shop\u2019s backroom as an HQ and hangout. Poor, sensitive Leonard has to quietly accept their boozy bullying (he\u2019s actually fond of a drink himself) and get on with the trade about which he is passionate. It has given him a skill in sizing up men\u2019s bodies and also their souls: he knows from the way they carry themselves what sort of people they are, and how to dress them. Leonard has a fatherly concern for his secretary, Mable (a nice performance from Zoey Deutch), who is keeping secrets from him. Things go terribly wrong when a rat in Roy Boyle\u2019s organisation is suspected of selling them out to a rival gang and also the FBI, which has been tape-recording incriminating conversations using a device concealed with the rat\u2019s help. Now the guys have managed to get hold of one of these tapes, and if they can play it, they will discover the bug\u2019s location and get a fix on the rat\u2019s identity. But what if the rat is higher up than anyone thinks?In truth, the \u201ctape\u201d MacGuffin is a bit laboured, and the whole movie seems sometimes to be moving at about 80\u201390% of its required speed and energy. And there is also something stylised and slightly non-realistic about the way the nationwide mob is imagined to be an occult secret organisation called \u201cthe Outfit\u201d, slightly different from the Cosa Nostra we already know about. But there is also a theatrical charm and composure to the performances (and once again, it\u2019s time to marvel at the way Brit actors such as Beale and Flynn get to play Chicago tough guys). We know that these soldiers of crime are underestimating humble civilian Leonard, but it remains for us to find out what has actually been going on. It\u2019s an entertaining, fairly overwrought piece, a little tightly buttoned. The Outfit screened at the Berlin film festival. It\u2019s scheduled for release on 18 March 2022 in the US and 8 April in the UK.","540":"The line is there to be crossed in this engrossing, unnerving but unexpectedly sympathetic drama of family dysfunction from French-Swiss film-maker Ursula Meier who made her memorable debut back in 2008 with the eco-parable Home, starring a particularly intransigent Isabelle Huppert. Meier has a knack of creating overwhelming mothers: Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi is on very imperious and distrait form as Christina, a former classical concert pianist who abandoned her career for her family and never let her three daughters forget it \u2013 finally becoming a demanding music teacher who also appears to have taken her oldest child as a pupil. This is Margaret (St\u00e9phanie Blanchoud) who is a talented pop musician, singer and guitarist with a thriving local following.Maybe Margaret owes some of her success to her impossible mother and maybe she doesn\u2019t. But her explosive temper is worsened by any contact with her mum and the film begins with a spectacular, violent fight in slo-mo in front of her aghast sisters Louise (India Hair) and Marion (Elli Spagnolo), accompanied by some of the tasteful classical music that has helped drive Margaret over the edge. It\u2019s caused by \u2026 what? Everything and nothing. It\u2019s been building her whole life. But Margaret gives her mother a slap to the side of the head which gives Christina tinnitus \u2013 what she describes as a continuous high B-flat in her head.Nobody\u2019s pressing charges but Margaret is served with a restraining order: she cannot go within 100 metres of her mother, a restriction which Marion enforces by solemnly painting a blue line around their property. So Christine, tormented by her pain and her toxic anger, haunts this line, this limit of her behaviour, even bringing out her electric guitar so that she can help Marion practise her solo singing. (She too has inherited her mother\u2019s musical talent.)All of these characters start the film as hardly more than caricature; people in the shadow of this strange and rather shocking act of violence. But as Margaret\u2019s cuts and bruises fade so does the emotional temperature, and the three women emerge as fully rounded and even rather likable people. Even Christina, once she has got rid of the baby grand piano that dominated the family living room, becomes a bit easier to live with.It could be that La Ligne will become part of that distinct film tradition \u2013 alongside movies such as Bob Rafelson\u2019s Five Easy Pieces, James Toback\u2019s Fingers and Michael Haneke\u2019s The Piano Teacher \u2013 which is about the cost of seriously studying music, about the pain that is a toxic, unacknowledged byproduct. It also has very good performances from Blanchoud and Bruni-Tedeschi. La Ligne (The Line) screened at the Berlin film festival.","541":"Fran\u00e7ois Ozon made a breakthrough in his film-making career in 2000 with an adaptation of an unproduced stage play by Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Water Drops on Burning Rocks. Now, to open this year\u2019s Berlin film festival, he has returned to the dark master of New German Cinema with a gender-switched version of Fassbinder\u2019s 1972 movie The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant, that strange, angular, claustrophobic drama in which only women appear on screen.Fassbinder\u2019s film is set entirely in the apartment of a fashion designer who has an emotionally abusive relationship with her live-in assistant, and then conceives a mad and despairing love for a beautiful young woman who openly cheats on her. Ozon makes some of these characters men, but only some of them. We have to hope he doesn\u2019t get the kind of grief that Paul Feig got for his all-female Ghostbusters, from Fassbinder fans claiming he has trashed their childhoods.Ozon has removed the bitter tears from the title and also the film itself. For all the histrionics, this is a lot more genial, campy and comic than Fassbinder\u2019s gaunt ordeal. And that is down to it being (mostly) male. The female fashionista is now a male movie director, Peter von Kant, boisterously played by Denis M\u00e9nochet \u2013 with hints that he\u2019s sort of supposed to be Fassbinder himself, though Fassbinder was a lot tougher and more unsentimental than this guy.Peter has a deadpan houseboy-slash-amanuensis called Karl (Stefan Crepon) who hilariously (as opposed to tragically or erotically) is the intimate witness to all the passionate confrontations between Peter and his lover. Petra\u2019s bitchy female frenemy from the first film is still female: Sidonie, played by Isabelle Adjani. Also still female is Peter\u2019s teen daughter, home from boarding school, played by Aminthe Audiard (grandniece of Jacques). Her pert presence is what makes this (like Water Drops on Burning Rocks) resemble something by No\u00ebl Coward. Peter\u2019s beautiful, duplicitous lover Amin is played by Khalil Ben Gharbia and Hanna Schygulla, who played the lover role in 1972, has been brought back to play Peter\u2019s mother.The dynamics are definitely different now that there are both men and women on the screen: it is less airless and crazed, although just as theatrical and artificial. Ozon often gives his characters stagey entrances by framing them self-consciously in a doorway. Ozon\u2019s chief coup is making Peter a film director, meaning Peter can give Amin a screen test then and there in his apartment, during which he asks Amin about his parents\u2019 tragic death as the camera is rolling and responds with the intensity \u2013 part sadistic, part empathetic \u2013 of the killer in Peeping Tom. Both M\u00e9nochet and Gharbia are very good in this scene.Yet there is something lighter, almost flippant and French-farcical about this new Von Kant: a man brought low by l\u2019amour, inviting from the audience hardly more than a worldly, sympathetic shrug.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotion Peter von Kant screened at the Berlin film festival; it is released on 23 December on Curzon Home Cinema, and on 30 December in cinemas.","542":"Romance in your 30s is no puppy-love business: youthful idealism ebbs with each passing year, while regrets gradually encroach. Setting sail in the muddy waters of modern relationships, Shakun Batra\u2019s star-studded Hindi drama shows that infidelity is never a simple affair.Haunted by her parents\u2019 unhappy marriage and her mother\u2019s suicide, Alisha (Deepika Padukone) is stuck in a cycle of stagnancy that encompasses her yoga-instructor job and her boyfriend Karan (Dhairya Karwa). On a seaside weekend with her cousin Tia (Ananya Panday) and her fiance Zain (Siddhant Chaturvedi), Alisha is paradoxically attracted to and unnerved by their lavish lifestyle, whose flashy allure starkly contrasts with the modest home she shares with struggling writer Karan. When Zain makes a brazen pass at her, it spirals into a torrid flurry of hotel sex and illicit messages. Promises of commitment are exchanged only to be delayed, as Zain\u2019s real-estate business depends on investment from Tia\u2019s parents. What starts out as a breezy liaison soon warps into a resentful brew of paranoia.While the lurid twists and turns are enjoyable in a 90s erotic thriller kind of way, the sudden shift towards suspense hampers Padukone\u2019s performance. And what a performance it is! Though Alisha is caught up in crisscrossing relationships, in her few solitary moments an aching sense of loneliness emerges as she is let down by every male figure in her life. While Padukone lights up the screen, Gehraiyaan could have used the economical writing of Ijaazat (1987) or Masoom (1983) \u2013 two classic and, to be honest, better films about romantic betrayal. The main photo on this article was changed on 11 February 2022. The previous photo featured Ananya Panday, not Deepika Padukone as the caption said. Gehraiyaan is released on 11 February on Amazon Prime Video.","543":"Machines might seem an antithetical thing to get sentimental about, but in Jean-Pierre Jeunet\u2019s view of them as imperfect, quirk-prone and funny, they\u2019re pretty much human. The film-maker cobbles together off-kilter worlds where everything is mechanized yet nothing works properly, daily life turned into an absurd burlesque of glitches, miscommunications, system errors and sound-the-alarm snafus. In early-career triumphs like Delicatessen or The City of Lost Children, Jeunet assembled Rube Goldberg contraptions with such fastidious personal care that they couldn\u2019t help but be imbued with the idiosyncrasies of their creator. Sometimes, he\u2019ll apply this notion in a more figurative way to satirize the catch-22-clogged French bureaucracy, a giant engine seemingly built to malfunction. He gets in one or two such cracks with his latest film Bigbug, in which fees incur fees that incur fees. Mostly, however, he\u2019s concerned about actual robots.Technology takes the explicit focus of Jeunet\u2019s literally screw-loose new comedy, now landing on Netflix (with a dearth of fanfare, surprising for the director behind one of the highest-grossing foreign-language releases in the history of American moviegoing). The streaming platform is an ironic place for a film so wary of the \u201cinternet of things\u201d to end up, though it\u2019s caught between the digital and analog on a few concurrent levels. The action has been confined to a home full of hinky practical-effect androids, wedged in a prefab neighborhood of little-box CGI conformity. A revolution among next-gen automatons raging outside traps a collection of homo sapiens there, mismatched caricatures befitting the broad sex farce inexplicably jammed in the middle of this commentary on AI run amok. Between klutzy ploys to get into each other\u2019s pants, the organic life forms collude with the cruder household bots they have come to consider family to beat back the real menace: the charmless homogeneity of smart-tech.Something\u2019s not right with the ubiquitous off-brand Robocops cheekily dubbed Yonyx (Fran\u00e7ois Levantal), their forehead QR-code tattoos and oversized fake teeth unsettling even before they rise up in a coup d\u2019etat. They are polished to the point of untrustworthiness; fittingly, one of their kind gains traction as a fringe politician. This dash of background color plays on a television in the home of Alice (Elsa Zylberstein), which is kept in order by a short circuit-looking vacuum, a talking bust of Albert Einstein that walks on animatronic spider legs and the bob-haired electro-maid Monique (Claude Perron). They\u2019re three of the good ones, friendly and helpful when not on the fritz, somewhere between nanny and pet for Alice and daughter Nina (Marysole Fertard). Most importantly, they\u2019re cool with servitude, garbling any class-based allegories in favor of a loftier ontological journey to learn what it means to be human.Their joint quest to become a real boy\/girl\/vacuum often plays like the B-plot to the goings-on with Alice\u2019s many guests. We\u2019ve got a sleazy suitor (Stephane de Groodt) and his surly teen son (H\u00e9lie Thonnat), her loutish ex-husband (Youssef Hajdi) and his trophy girlfriend (Claire Chust), her aging neighbor (Isabelle Nanty) and the obsolete hunk (Alban Lenoir) she\u2019s programmed to love her. Locked indoors until the threat level beyond their impregnable walls sinks to an acceptable number, they moon over one another with serviceable bawdy humor that only briefly veers into that distinctly Gallic brand of shrillness. A running gag involving the Kama Sutra provides a helpful reminder that the national perception of the French as highbrow sophisticates does not account for their studio comedies.Thinking beyond the containment of his chamber-piece setup, Jeunet indulges in some universe-building that takes his signature combination of the morbid and silly to a brighter, peppier register. In the teal retro-futurist kitchen, Monique shakes nutritious crickets out of a box like cereal, and on the TV, the show \u201cHomo Ridiculus\u201d subjects humans to humiliating scenarios for the amusement of the Yonyx. Outside the window, roving drones blare advertisements personalized to the rapidly deteriorating state of society. The tone stays light even as the incoming tide of robo-fascism worsens to book-burning, but the bleak details of dystopia are always rapping at the door.Whether it\u2019s the scenery or the cybernetic characters, Jeunet takes far more interest in things than the people he leaves as thin archetypal sketches. Lest this be mistaken for coldness, he locates the film\u2019s soul in those searching for one, the quirkier robots treated with more affection than their mass-produced counterparts goose-stepping out of Silicon Valley. With his work now migrating online and his jerry-rigged methods increasingly outsourced to post-production effects, Jeunet can\u2019t avoid the impending digitization of cinema, nor life. Still, he\u2019s not going down without landing a few good fingers to the ribs first.Bigbug is now available on Netflix","544":"Fifteen-year-old Maria (Rihane Khalil Alio) is pregnant and in desperate need of an abortion. The procedure is taboo in Chad, where she lives. It\u2019s up to her single mother, Amina (Achouackh Abakar Souleymane), to find a solution, aided by a secret network of women.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be like you, Mum. They think you\u2019re a loose woman,\u201d says Maria, face turned away from the camera, to her mother. Amina, on the other hand, meets the film-maker\u2019s gaze head-on. In this compelling though not exactly subtle drama from Chadian writer-director Mahamat-Saleh Haroun, Amina is a beacon of hope in brightly coloured robes. Her grit and determination are apparent from the opening scene, in which she breaks down a tyre for scrap metal.","545":"Astronauts Jo (Halle Berry) and Brian (Patrick Wilson) witness a freak accident, caused by an undulating mass of black matter.

It\u2019s up to Brian and Jo to return to space and defeat what they call \u201cthe swarm\u201d.There are too many characters and too many redemption arcs in this silly, overstuffed sci-fi. At least the eye-poppingly expensive special effects are cool.

The crowd cheers as her dress explodes, raining multicoloured petals. In this gorgeous, big-hearted anime from Mamoru Hosoda (Mirai, Summer Wars), Belle is the virtual avatar of Suzu (Kaho Nakamura), a grieving teenager and \u201cmousy country bumpkin\u201d, according to her best friend. We soon learn that her mother, who taught her to play the piano, died when she was a child. Suzu hasn\u2019t been able to sing since. U is a virtual reality she accesses via an app on her phone. It\u2019s here, inside this twinkling digital metropolis, that Suzu becomes Belle and rediscovers her voice.When one of Belle\u2019s concerts is interrupted by a mysterious horned Dragon (Takeru Satoh), U\u2019s self-appointed police step in, threatening to catch him and expose his true identity. Understanding the protection afforded by adopting an avatar, Belle goes out of her way to protect him.The floating city of U sits suspended in an infinite starry sky; Hosoda imagines the internet as a glittering expanse of endless possible connections. In the synthetic world, the camera is dynamic, with the animation rendered in 3D. Suzu\u2019s reality is flatter and hand-drawn. In U, avatars are automatically generated based on their users\u2019 hidden strengths. Belle sings, because Suzu has something to express. The film\u2019s message is a beautiful one: to integrate our real-life vulnerabilities with the persona we project is to become all the more powerful.","547":"What is \u201cThe Souvenir\u201d? In Joanna Hogg\u2019s autobiographically inspired 2019 drama, that title appeared to refer specifically to an 18th-century Fragonard painting depicting a young woman (the heroine of Rousseau\u2019s epistolary novel Julie, apparently) carving the name of her lover into a tree trunk. In that film, set in the 1980s, Julie Harte (played by Hogg\u2019s goddaughter Honor Swinton Byrne) is introduced to the painting by an enigmatic man with whom she is falling in love. Like Hogg, Julie is perplexed by what the painting means and by her own increasingly tumultuous feelings for her mysterious companion.In this flipside second instalment of Hogg\u2019s most personal and surprisingly most accessible work, the word \u201csouvenir\u201d takes on a rather more metatextual meaning. This time the film itself becomes a kind of cinematic keepsake, a memory of a memory (or a dream of a dream?) set in the aftermath of Julie\u2019s relationship with the heroin-addicted Anthony. An overwhelming presence in the first episode, as portrayed by Tom Burke, Anthony is now an even more confounding absence, leaving Julie struggling to make sense of their former life together, with all its mysteries and misdirections. Who was her lover? Did she ever really know him? Did he actually work for the Foreign Office? Where did he go as the end approached? Who did he talk to? What was he thinking?More significantly, The Souvenir Part II finds Julie finding herself, embracing her own future as a film-maker even as she wrestles with the ghosts of the past. Like Eva Husson\u2019s underrated Mothering Sunday (which I stumblingly described in this paper as feeling \u201cmore like an emotional memory than an unfolding narrative\u201d), this is a creative coming-of-age story \u2013 a portrait of the artist as a young woman discovering her own voice. Appropriately enough, the very last voice we hear in the film\u2019s wonderfully self-reflexive finale is that of Hogg herself.Facing the prospect of having to make her film-school graduation project while still reeling from the fallout of her doomed relationship, Julie channels her personal experiences into a free-form script (a \u201cmemorial\u201d) that baffles and irks her tutors. Meanwhile, creative battles also engulf Julie\u2019s fellow film students, most notably wannabe auteur Patrick (Richard Ayoade), whose own film has more than a hint of Julien Temple\u2019s Absolute Beginners (\u201cI always wanted to be like Orson Welles\u201d), and who tells his editor: \u201cYou\u2019re forcing me to have a tantrum!\u201dIt\u2019s a laugh-out-loud moment, one of many in Hogg\u2019s oeuvre in which intense soul-searching is habitually broken by brittle humour, alerting us to a playful sensibility beneath the often austere surface. There are shocks too: a domestic scene in which Julie\u2019s mother, Rosalind (played once again by a flinty Tilda Swinton), reacts with tremulous grace to an unexpected breakage gave me a start that had me burying my face in my hands \u2013 a sort of laughing-screaming-squirming symphony of tragicomic awkwardness.As for the film Julie is making, at times it appears that we are watching a Pirandello-esque behind-the-scenes doc about the making of The Souvenir, viewed through a kaleidoscopic maze of self-reflection. Just as Julie tells her tutors that she\u2019s no longer interested in showing life \u201cas it plays out\u201d but rather \u201cas I imagine it\u201d, so Hogg also uses an audacious cinematic sleight of hand to conjure yet another movie-within-the-movie, revisiting events that we have previously seen portrayed with uncanny realism, but here reimagined as fantastical flights of fancy that owe a debt to the dreamy dance sequences of old-school Hollywood musicals.It\u2019s a bold move, and one that invokes both Singin\u2019 in the Rain and Fellini\u2019s 8\u00bd \u2013 not comparisons I thought I\u2019d be making after reviewing The Souvenir. Yet watching parts I and II back to back (the first is conveniently available on BBC iPlayer), they do miraculously come together as a coherent whole, an adventurous meditation on the alchemical process of making life imitate art and vice versa. Hogg (who recently confessed to me her love of disaster movies) is currently working on a ghost story, her first foray into \u201cgenre\u201d cinema. I can\u2019t wait!","548":"If you\u2019ve blitzed through Cobra Kai and it\u2019s left you hankering for yet more fight-based, 80s throwback drama, consider checking out the work of prolific action movie star Scott Adkins in the truly excellent Ninja Shadow of a Tear (AKA Ninja 2).Ninja Shadow of a Tear is the weirdly titled sequel to 2009\u2019s rather more simplistic Ninja. But it works well as a self-contained entity, ditching any remaining story threads from the first film within the first 10 minutes so you can comfortably watch them in reverse order and kick your evening off with the better one.Casey Bowman (Adkins) returns home one night to find his wife Namiko (Mika Hijii) has been brutally slain by an unknown assailant with a unique but deadly weapon. Casey accepts an offer from his friend Nakabara (Kane Kosugi) to stay at his dojo in Bangkok in an attempt to find peace. But Casey\u2019s grief continues to manifest in self-destructive behaviour, losing his temper in a sparring session and drunkenly starting a massive bar fight.When one of Nakabara\u2019s students turns up dead, killed by the same unique weapon that took Namiko\u2019s life, Casey\u2019s thirst for vengeance leads him on a hunt through Bangkok and the jungles of Myanmar to the doorstep of an infamous drug lord known as Goro (Shun Sugata).Although Ninja Shadow of a Tear\u2019s plot is a classic revenge rampage, it still finds space to make its simple story more interesting than most. Casey\u2019s journey is fuelled more by his grief than his desire for revenge. He gets things wrong, fights the wrong people, and in many ways he wants to get beaten up himself. But like any good genre movie it doesn\u2019t necessarily need to be original; it just needs to play to its strengths. In Ninja Shadow of a Tear\u2019s case, those strengths largely lie in Adkins\u2019 unparalleled ability to kick a lot of people in the face.With a colossal 59 movies under his belt and an upcoming appearance in John Wick 4, Adkins has been busy. Ninja Shadow of a Tear marked the sixth time (out of nine) that he worked with director Isaac Florentine. The Adkins\/Florentine axis flourished in the mid-2000s to mid-2010s, courtesy of the two Ninja movies and the Undisputed series \u2013 three stylish direct-to-video prison fight movies that served as nominal sequels to Walter Hill\u2019s 2002 original. With a surprisingly deft focus on character and stunning fight sequences, both the Ninja and Undisputed series belie their direct-to-video roots to offer up some of the most enjoyably knuckleheaded action since Jean-Claude Van Damme\u2019s kinetic prime.Florentine\u2019s direction captures every bone-crunching kick and deadly elbow in luxurious slow motion, while Adkins\u2019 acrobatic fighting prowess seems to defy all known laws of physics. Every spin kick and airborne punch asserts that gravity is a mug\u2019s game and something for other people to worry about (meanwhile, I\u2019m watching from the couch, shovelling biscuits into my face like it\u2019s the end of the world).The other reason Ninja Shadow of a Tear is so much fun is because it has absolutely no pretensions about being anything other than a one-man-army action film. It wears its love for 1980s action and ninja movies proudly on its sleeve and arguably does it better than the classics that preceded it.Casting Kosugi as Nakabara is a masterstroke; he is the son of legendary martial artist Sh\u00f4 Kosugi who appeared in Cannon Film\u2019s ninja trilogy \u2013 Enter The Ninja, Revenge of the Ninja, Ninja III: The Domination \u2013 a staple of video stores everywhere. There\u2019s also a nod to Schwarzenegger\u2019s Commando, as Adkins rampages through the woods, taking on an army by himself and announcing his arrival at the drug compound via hand grenade. Amusingly, there is no concession to traditional ninja stealth, but that\u2019s all part of the fun.For additional viewing, you can catch the first Ninja on Prime and 10 of Adkins\u2019 other movies on Netflix. His Art of Action series on YouTube \u2013 a lockdown project where Adkins interviews a fascinating selection of action stars, directors and stunt people \u2013 is also well worth seeking out.Ninja Shadow of a Tear is a movie I love on a cellular level: as an introduction to Adkins\u2019 filmography, as a nostalgic love letter to ninja movies and VHS rentals, and as an unashamedly fun slice of modern martial arts cinema.","549":"When transfer student Shion arrives at Keibu high school, only one girl, loner Satomi, knows the truth about her: the new girl is an AI robot undergoing covert field testing \u2013 and Satomi\u2019s mother\u2019s job hangs in the balance, depending on the success of the experiment. Unfortunately, Shion\u2019s tendency to burst into song and hack the PA system to play a backing track soon alerts the other students to the fact that she\u2019s slightly out of the ordinary.Yasuhiro Yoshiura\u2019s strikingly beautiful anime is high-concept in its themes and unashamedly sentimental in its execution, and gets rather more interesting in its darker second half. Ultimately, like Mamoru Oshii\u2019s 1995 film Ghost in the Shell and its sequel, Innocence, Sing a Bit of Harmony delves into the idea of what form an AI might take and whether it can love.","550":"Like many of the irresistibly catchy pop songs it showcases, Sing 2 follows a tried and tested formula. Hapless koala bear promoter Buster Moon (Matthew McConaughey) must risk failure, humiliation and being chucked out of the window of a luxury hotel to put on a show. His animal stars (including two pigs, an elephant, a gorilla and a porcupine) overcome various obstacles to perform to a non-stop soundtrack of pop and rock bangers. What\u2019s more, everything rests on luring a reclusive star \u2013 in this case Clay Calloway (Bono) \u2013 out of retirement. It\u2019s a formula, after all, that made a considerable hit out of the first film, which was also written and directed by Garth Jennings. While there are no surprises whatsoever here, the perky charm remains.","551":"A true-life story that traces one woman\u2019s tumultuous relationship with her serially unreliable father, Sean Penn\u2019s Flag Day looks terrific. With its grainy, handheld camerawork and fondness for gloaming, magic-hour light, visually it feels like a cross between Terrence Malick\u2019s Badlands and Barbara Loden\u2019s Wanda. But the film, adapted by Jez and John-Henry Butterworth from a memoir by the journalist Jennifer Vogel, and starring Penn and his daughter, Dylan, makes heavy weather of the story at times.For all the bold stylistic decisions and visual energy, the actual storytelling tangles itself up in a convoluted, nonlinear structure, depleting some of the thrust and restlessness of the camerawork. Still, as forger, con artist and sometime bank robber John Vogel and his daughter Jennifer, the Penns give committed \u2013 and in Dylan\u2019s case exposed \u2013 performances. Their real-life relationship brings authenticity to their scenes together; however, this fails to fully anchor some of the more showily histrionic moments.","552":"Makis Papadimitriou is the actor who gave a great performance in what deserves to be a modern Greek movie classic: Suntan, in which he played a depressed vacation-resort doctor who conceives a Death-In-Venice obsession with one of the beautiful young sunseekers. So it\u2019s good to see him again, but this is a very tiresome and pointless shaggy-dog-story-slash-road-movie that offers no compelling reason for its own existence, and certainly no interesting or satisfying ending.Papadimitriou is Antonis, a middle-aged loser who finds himself single with a Hornbyesque vinyl collection and a sideline in singing with an embarrassing band, along with his mate Christos (Michalis Sarantis). To combat their creeping ennui, our two amigos decide to go on a quest: to track down the (fictional) 90s softcore VHS porn star called Laura Durand with whom they had both become mildly obsessed, because she vanished from the business 20 years ago, becoming the Greta Garbo of Europe\u2019s adult entertainment scene. And so they go on a quest to find Laura, with at one stage a weird Lynchian diversion into black-and-white, and really a lot of zany and quirky encounters, which are written and directed like kids\u2019 TV, and some hallucinatory visions of Laura in which she appears bisected with video scan lines, as in her cheesy erotic movies.In some ways, this reminded me of the various documentaries about the real-life 70s porn star Mary Millington, whose unhappy life and death created a cultish posthumous fanbase. Well, a factual porn star is one thing. But a fictional one who does not shed any real light on female or male sexuality, and who is not a very interesting character, is something else. In the Strange Pursuit of Laura Durand is released on 31 January on digital platforms.","553":"Here is a stylised and self-aware serial killer drama in black-and-white, broken down into nine \u201cnights\u201d. A young woman called Nada (Nour Hajri) picks up men in bars, playing on their protective gallantry or predatory instinct for weakness, by pretending to be vocally impaired and needing a voice app on her phone to speak. She goes home with them after a few drinks and horror ensues. But Nada finds herself vulnerable in falling for a young woman at her workplace, Noura (Rym Hayouni), who herself begins to realise what is happening in Nada\u2019s after-hours existence.Black Medusa comes from first-time Tunisian film-makers Youssef Chebbi and Isma\u00ebl, who may conceivably be fans of Ana Lily Amirpour\u2019s cult monochrome vampire film A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night. There is a scene when Nada is walking one of her victims back to his apartment and a couple of cats wander into view that reminded me of Amirpour\u2019s very cat-friendly movie. And Nada\u2019s deadpan and implacable avenger might put you in mind of Carey Mulligan\u2019s assailant in Promising Young Woman.The noir mood of menace and emotional deadness in Black Medusa has been very carefully contrived and curated. Perhaps the ultimate irony is that it is Nada who has been turned to stone. I wasn\u2019t sure quite how far the procedural aspect of serial-killing takes us in this film, however \u2013 either as commentary on the macho culture of north Africa (or anywhere) or as a drama on its own terms. The approach is cool, blank, as if the film does not want to risk investing too much in what is happening. And I wasn\u2019t sure how much was waiting for us at the end of the garden path along which we are being led.There are some very sharp moments, particularly one victim who starts sharing about how romance died between him and his long-term partner when they decided to get married: \u201cWe stopped being in love on our wedding day.\u201d Black Medusa is on Mubi from 28 January.","554":"Palm Trees and Power Lines, a remarkably sharp-eyed and bruising debut from writer-director Jamie Dack, opens in the distended, languid stretch of a teenage summer. Lea, played in a stunning first turn by newcomer Lily McInerny, is 17 years old and bored. She lives with her single mother, harried and yearning Sandra (Gretchen Mol), somewhere in small-town, coastal California \u2013 palm trees and power lines, railroad tracks and modest homes \u2013 and floats through the days with sunbathing, YouTube makeup tutorials, and trips to the cheap ice cream chain store with her lustful best friend Amber (Quinn Frankel).Lots of films mistake glamorizing and maturing adolescence for capturing it, but Dack\u2019s feature, developed from her 2018 short of the same name, is saturated with the teenage. The actors are fresh-faced and gangly, and Dack has a keen ear for the vacuity and experimental crudeness of teenage conversations \u2013 boys ranking girls they know on a 10-point scale, girls playing along to hang, fart jokes, generally talking about nothing. Lea spends a good portion of the first 15 minutes prone \u2013 on the ground, on the floor with Amber, on the couch, on a lounge chair, in the backseat of someone\u2019s car during passionless sex with a clueless boy \u2013 and the camera is there with her, on her level, hemmed by the smallness of her world.So when Lea catches the eye of Tom (Jonathan Tucker), a handsome 34-year-old mechanic, at a diner, the stark gap of their ages is immediately clear. Tom is muscular, graying at the temples, his cool demeanor barely concealing some jittery menace. Lea is a near child. She sees his wink, his autonomy, his curiosity in her, as magnetic, intoxicating, special. We see a girl made vulnerable by loneliness, red flags and a cliche. Dack\u2019s tracing of this ominous seduction over the film\u2019s first half is a brilliant portrait of isolation and hunger to be seen. Through McInerny\u2019s pooled brown eyes and quicksilver laugh, we see Lea come alive under his attention. We see the Tom she sees \u2013 charming, empathetic, interesting \u2013 and how lines like \u201cYou\u2019re not like any girl I know\u201d and \u201cI feel like I can be open with you\u201d are so potent, thrilling.But the things Lea does not yet understand are never obscured: possessiveness that isn\u2019t romantic but alarming, the manipulation of said lines, the pure sketchiness of a man who spends his days with a teenage girl. When Tom takes her to \u201chis place\u201d \u2013 a motel \u2013 for sex, Lea is initially disappointed, but subsumes it in desire. Dack manages to build Tom\u2019s allure for Lea while still consistently puncturing it. Her friends call him a pedophile; a waitress asks if she needs help after witnessing one of their dates, and we know she\u2019s right.Casting is essential here. In order for the relationship to both entrance and repulse, the characters need to look believably their age, not a Hollywood 17. Such was an issue with the Hulu series A Teacher, about a sexual relationship between a thirty-something female teacher and her 17-year-old student. Episodes were bookended with warnings and resources, but intimate scenes between the 24-year-old actor Nick Robinson, as the student, and Kate Mara\u2019s teacher were titillating rather than queasy; in any other show, the two could plausibly play lovers. Same with An Education, the 2009 British drama in which 24-year-old Carey Mulligan, in her breakout role, played the 16-year-old schoolgirl half of a heady relationship with a much older con man (played by Peter Sarsgaard).Palm Trees and Power Lines provides no such out. McInerny, knobby knee-ed and adolescent-metabolism thin, looks as most 17-year-old girls do: more child than adult. Tom looms over her. In one crucial scene in the film\u2019s quiet scream of a second half, Tom whisks Lea away to a hotel and Dack sets the camera across the room, so we can view both of their gazes as he undresses her \u2013 she ravished, astounded and disbelieving; he greedy, lascivious, wrong. There is no sheen of sexiness here.The film\u2019s final section questionably dives into some brutally dark material, but avoids the potholes of melodrama by remaining grounded in Lea\u2019s flickering awareness, then devastation, at the peril of her situation. Credit to an all-female creative team, including co-screenwriter Audrey Findlay, producer Leah Chen Baker, and director of photography Chananun Chotrungroj, whose restraint during a gut-punch, extended intimate sequence in the hotel room (there\u2019s no nudity) keeps Lea\u2019s frazzled nerves and silent horror at the center of devastating encounter. We are aware of her exploitation, the shock and disillusionment and confusion of it, without ever exploiting her body.It\u2019s trite to say a debut performance is a revelation, but the whole film simply does not work without McInerny, who is fully convincing as a girl on an emotional precipice. It\u2019s an astoundingly calibrated turn, one of barely lidded emotions that eventually skitter about. By the end, I had a pit in my stomach, desperate to know how Lea proceeds from dawning disillusionment. The summer evenings are still light, but there\u2019s a heaviness in this unnerving, meticulous debut, knowing the events Lea will litigate with herself for years to come.Palm Trees and Power Lines is showing at the Sundance film festival with a release date to be announced","555":"\u201cThe whole world is watching! The whole world is watching!\u201d chants a group of student protesters \u2013 \u201cyippies\u201d, in the eyes of suspicious, coiffed lawyers \u2013 in the opening scene of Call Jane, screenwriter Phyllis Nagy\u2019s meticulous, if not revelatory, film on an underground network of abortion providers in Chicago. It\u2019s August 1968, five years before Roe v Wade, and the energy is combustible enough to ruffle even Joy (Elizabeth Banks, a fascinating mix of softness and steel), a suburban housewife pregnant with her second child.Joy, to use the parlance of a later decade, \u201chas it all\u201d \u2013 an attractive, successful husband in lawyer Will (Chris Messina), a picket-fence house, 15-year-old daughter Charlotte (Grace Edwards) \u2013 but she is still drawn to the buzz of revolution. In an arresting first scene, the camera follows behind Joy, polished and bejeweled, past the yippie clash with police to her husband\u2019s car, where she muses over their mantra out loud.Call Jane, from a screenplay by Hayley Schore and Roshan Sethi, plants this seed of an awakening for Joy and watches it bloom, in a sensitive, sometimes too on-the-nose manner. Shortly after the yippie run-in, Joy is informed that her pregnancy threatens her life. The hospital rejects her appeal for a \u201ctherapeutic termination\u201d; in an example of Call Jane hammering home the point, the all-male hospital board discuss her life in front of Joy as if she\u2019s invisible, immaterial, silent. Will, a status quo guy, feels resigned to their decision. Joy, incensed and unleashed, calls \u201cJane\u201d, a number for pregnant women who are \u201canxious\u201d, plastered on flyers around town.Thus Joy is initiated into the Jane Collective, and Call Jane into a restrained, though sharper than it could\u2019ve been, ode to heroism of the past acts of radical generosity and courage which could hold a dark echo for the future, as Roe v Wade rests on the supreme court\u2019s chopping block this year. The real Jane Collective women are explored in another Sundance film this year, the HBO documentary The Janes; one of its participants, Judith Arcana, served as a historical consultant on Call Jane. In Schore and Sethi\u2019s version, the fictional Joy\u2019s transition from patient to reluctant participant to full-blown activist is guided by Virginia (Sigourney Weaver), an iron-willed, true-blue grassroots activist who governs the Janes with a chastened practicality, and Dean (Cory Michael Smith), the preening, somewhat skeevy doctor who provides critical abortion services for $600 a pop.Call Jane\u2019s tracking of these revolutionaries, due their spotlight, is straightforward and clear-eyed, similar in measured tone (and 60s soundtrack) to an episode of prestige period drama TV, such as FX on Hulu\u2019s Mrs America, in which Banks evocatively plays another conservative midwesterner turned feminist activist. That\u2019s not a criticism, per se; it\u2019s refined, sensitive, humanized historicism, with clear arc and stakes, a stylized window into a different time.It\u2019s worth questioning the decision to use a white, conventionally beautiful suburban housewife whose abortion is a stark matter of life and death as an entre\u00e9 into this world. The film acknowledges this shortcoming with several pointed lines about the dearth of black clients who can\u2019t afford the service, and through the concerns of Gwen (Wunmi Mosaku), who needles Virginia to hold to her principles of equity by finding a way to provide free abortions and prioritize black women. (Virginia\u2019s solution, which involves a striptease negotiation with the fascinating Dean, is a standout scene.) But Banks\u2019s Joy is so layered \u2013 unbowed in her decisions, her personhood, yet still scared, tentative \u2013 to defuse most doubt in this choice.Each of the supporting characters, too, has intriguing shades of grey in small roles. Joy\u2019s widowed neighbor Lana (Kate Mara, doing a lot with a little), numbed by pills, booze and a copy of Diary of a Mad Housewife, strikes up a charged bond with Will as Joy spends less and less time at home, arousing everyone\u2019s suspicions. Messina imbues Will with a dampened charm that peeks through his frustrating complacency with the norms of his day. Charlotte can seem 18 or 13 depending on the scene, but her peculiar allegiance to the moral stew in which she was raised make sense as a sheltered teenager.Call Jane particularly shines in Nagy\u2019s depiction of the abortion procedure itself \u2013 the camera hovers over the metal instruments, on either Dean or Joy\u2019s narration of the procedure, and each woman\u2019s face in anxious repose. The measured observance and repetition of these scenes manages to capture both the clinical precision of a medical procedure and a deeply personal, often frightening experience unique to each woman.That in itself is a feat, one that feels of a piece with recent realist, unsentimental depictions of abortion in the besieged present such as Never, Rarely, Sometimes, Always and Unpregnant. By film\u2019s end, the Janes\u2019 hope is galvanizing, bittersweet. Call Jane never quite rises to the level of a rousing battle cry, but does offer a studious examination of a past that could, terrifyingly, become our future.Call Jane screened at the Sundance film festival and is released in the UK on 4 November.","556":"\u201cWhat is the best thing about Norway?\u201d asks the leading character in this intriguing film from Norwegian writer-director Anders Emblem. Her friend answers: \u201cMountains? A-ha?\u201d To which the original speaker replies that she was actually thinking more of things like the welfare state. It\u2019s a quibbling, playful, thoughtful exchange, which appears also to coincide with tentative sexual advances, and it\u2019s very characteristic of this elegant, seriocomic, beautifully shot, slow-cinema piece with some great cat acting and quirky touches of Murakami.Asta (Amalie Ibsen Jensen) is a young woman who lives with Live (Maria Agwumaro) in an airy apartment in the Norwegian port town of \u00c5lesund, opposite a derelict building at which Asta is often seen gazing thoughtfully. Live is a carpenter who specialises in repairing chairs. She also likes to play the electric organ that the landlord has left in the attic. In what appears to be a lull in her personal and professional life, Asta applies to the local newspaper, Sunnm\u00f8rsposten, for temporary shift work. After working on some stories about fan discontent with the local football team, and greedy developers threatening to destroy the art nouveau architecture for which the town is famous, Asta hits on a story that means something to her: an asylum seeker called Aslan who has been forcibly repatriated. She sets out to discover more about him and appears reasonably content with the resulting sombre article about Norwegians\u2019 troubled conscience \u2013 though the question of where Aslan is now is another matter.In fact, Asta (and Live) may both be more distracted by the issue of Asta\u2019s depression and possible self-harm. Everything that we see on screen: all the slow establishing shots, the angular visual compositions, all the bright, palate-cleansing tableaux of the town and its steep picturesque lanes, the sweet shots of the cat, the newspaper investigating and the chairs \u2026 It may all just be displacement activity. It may all simply be about Asta\u2019s healing \u2013 or about her reluctance to heal. And this healing also plays a part in the fact that Live appears to be in love with Asta.And the emptiness of the town is itself arresting. The pandemic isn\u2019t mentioned and no-one is wearing masks. But I wonder if Emblem hasn\u2019t adopted a kind of lockdown aesthetic for his movie, a deliberate dream-like emptiness. A Human Position is a question mark of a film with its elusive, happy-sad tone. It lingered in my mind. A Human Position screened at the Troms\u00f8 film festival in January 2021.","557":"It is impossible, at least for me, to watch a documentary on Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor and not be impacted knowing that her 17-year-old son has just died by apparent suicide, and she herself, as I write this, is hospitalized after sending suicidal tweets. Naturally, this was not the case when this project was being produced, and, logically speaking, these outside factors should have no bearing on my critical appraisal of this film.But Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor didn\u2019t become an international sensation by following the roads of logic. A very in-your-face emotionalism has always been her stock in trade. One can trace her early years, at least as I encountered her in the United States, with three distinct acts. Her first hit music video was initially shocking, debuting O\u2019Connor\u2019s revelatory genderfluid look, but the song, I Want Your (Hands On Me), is far from fiery and abrasive, indeed nothing but catchy and sensual, as a lover\u2019s call should be. Her eternal smash Nothing Compares 2 U remains one of pop music\u2019s rawest, empathetic, most heartbreaking tracks. (Crying in the video didn\u2019t hurt either.) Then there was the moment of righteous rage, ripping up a photo of Pope John Paul II on Saturday Night Live.Director Kathryn Ferguson has decided to cover, in vivid and exciting detail, O\u2019Connor\u2019s miserable upbringing, her overnight success, and her head-on collision with the sensationalist press and a fickle public. And that\u2019s it. While the documentary does thread a recent interview in voiceover, and there is a closing credits tag of a modern performance, Nothing Compares is simply more about the Sin\u00e9ad you already know.But a critic\u2019s original sin is to review the movie you want to see, not the movie that exists. To that end, with expectations managed, Nothing Compares is a quite engaging document. In it, one will find remarkable footage of Sin\u00e9ad, new to London in 1985, in rehearsals with her early band. She appears like a stick of dynamite in these washed-out videos, recorded in a small room with brick walls, her voice cartwheeling in pitch and volume, smiling to her bandmates, finding her footing, and unable to keep still. It\u2019s incredible.Counterbalancing these moments of joy is the deep dive into her abusive childhood. The cruelty she felt at her mother\u2019s hands, for which Sin\u00e9ad mostly blames the cycle of violence perpetuated by an Irish society in the grips of the Catholic Church, is represented in artfully re-enacted glimpses, though discussed in vivid detail. A sequence describing the origin of the song Troy explains how young Sin\u00e9ad was forced to live, day-and-night for an entire summer, in the garden behind her house, with her mother ignoring her cries from a lit window. To this day, she is triggered by the onset of dusk, as it reminds her of another oncoming night where she may not be let back in the house.One comes away from Nothing Compares fully understanding that this was an artist that really did have nothing to lose. When she acted indelicately in the United States, she wasn\u2019t looking for trouble, this was just a person already so troubled that there was no point in her playing a publicity game.Some may have forgotten that before her Saturday Night Live moment in 1992, there was a huge scandal after refusing to let the state-funded Garden State Arts Center in New Jersey play a tape of the American national anthem before her show, as was customary. (That facility is now the PNC Bank Arts Center, this is no longer an issue.) It is appalling to see the frothing, reactionary news clips to O\u2019Connor\u2019s simple request that the song not be played. It\u2019s a reminder that pig-headed, posturing tough guys weren\u2019t an invention of the Trump administration. Old interviews with Ireland\u2019s Gay Byrne of the Late, Late Show have much more tact, but are no less condescending.O\u2019Connor\u2019s call to \u201cfight the real enemy\u201d on SNL is shown in full, and another thing I did not know is that the photo she used was one that once belonged to her mother. Sin\u00e9ad didn\u2019t do anything that wasn\u2019t rich with meaning.The incident was soon followed up with an appearance at Bobfest, a concert at Madison Square Garden for Bob Dylan\u2019s 30th anniversary as a recording artist, in which she was scheduled to sing I Believe in You. She was met with a barrage of boos and applause, and since I Believe in You is a quiet song she knew she had to pivot. She belted out Bob Marley\u2019s War (as she did on SNL) a cappella, then sobbed in Kris Kristofferson\u2019s arms.Nothing Compares is essentially bookended by this moment, and presents it as both a triumph and tragic climax. She looked at the abyss and fought back. She didn\u2019t let the bastards get her down (as Kristofferson said quietly on stage) but she did, ultimately, retreat from the public sphere. It remains unclear if this was her choice, or because the press and mainstream society was just done with her. This is something for the next Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor documentary to investigate.Nothing Compares is showing at the Sundance film festival and will be released later this yearIn the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

The 1987 thriller that inspired the phrase \u201cbunny boiler\u201d \u2013 to describe a psychotically clingy lover \u2013 is back. Fatal Attraction exploited the terror of sexual promiscuity in the shadow of Aids, as well as the Reagan-era idealisation of the nuclear family. Cinema audiences booed the vengeful woman spurned by her married lover. Has the emphasis shifted now that gaslighting, white-male privilege and #MeToo have entered the lexicon?The script by James Dearden, who also wrote the film, gives the errant husband Dan Gallagher (Oliver Farnworth) narrating privileges (\u201cYou think I\u2019m crazy? You\u2019d be right!\u201d) but few glimmers of self-knowledge. More modulation from Farnworth would have been nice. Announcing bleakly that he once had it all, he sounds scarcely less peevish during flashbacks to happier days.Kym Marsh as Alex, who slashes her wrists then stalks Dan and his family, exhibits restraint in not vamping it up immediately. But the play still makes her blandly monstrous; an effect worthy of Attack of the 50 Foot Woman imagines her looming over Manhattan via video screen. Telling the story from Alex\u2019s perspective could have repurposed the material to better suit the times. There isn\u2019t much point incorporating mobile phones, feng shui and Covid fist bumps if the attitude still smacks of the 1980s.One radical difference is the ending, which sticks to Dearden\u2019s downbeat original draft that never made it to the film\u2019s final cut. Other scenes narrate what can\u2019t be shown (\u201cSulphuric acid! The car\u2019s completely ruined!\u201d) or downgrade what can. No groping in the elevator, no sex in the sink. There isn\u2019t enough heat on stage to toast a bunny, let alone boil one.John Macaulay as Dan\u2019s pal Jimmy has one devilish scene. After Alex reveals she is pregnant, he offers his friend a cheerful take worthy of Seinfeld\u2019s George Costanza: \u201cIt\u2019s early days. She could lose the baby!\u201d Everything is eclipsed, though, by the death of Bugs. On screen, we saw only the shocking aftermath. On stage, Alex hoists the pot on to the stove, cranks up the gas, then strolls away with a wicked smile. It\u2019s such a leisurely enterprise that it seems churlish not to add seasoning.Fatal Attraction is at the Theatre Royal, Brighton, until 22 January then touring.","559":"John Boyega gives an honest, intuitive and sensitive performance in this fervent if slightly by-the-numbers hostage drama \u2013 and it is one of Michael K Williams\u2019s final appearances on film, playing the negotiator. First-time feature director Abi Damaris Corbin has co-written the screenplay with the British dramatist Kwame Kwei-Armah, inspired by the real case of a depressed US Marine Corps veteran who in 2017 calmly walked into a bank in Atlanta, Georgia, and threatened to detonate the bomb he claimed was in his backpack unless he was paid the $892 he was owed in disability benefits \u2013 money that had been suddenly discontinued for opaque bureaucratic reasons, plunging him into poverty.Boyega plays Brian Easley, a guy who served honourably in the military but like so many in his position has found the transition to civilian life a trial; he has become estranged from his wife and infant daughter, alienated from his wider family, vulnerably housed and without stable employment, depressed and suffering from delusions. When he walks into the bank, his polite, almost diffident manner with the terrified bank clerks may be an indicator of his fundamental decency \u2013 or a symptom of his insanity. Selenis Leyva and Nicole Beharie play the bank employees, Olivia Washington is Brian\u2019s anguished wife and Williams is the negotiator \u2013 a former military man himself who understands how callous America can be to the guys like him and Brian.Breaking is interesting on the implied, unspoken endgame of hostage situations like this \u2013 the way negotiators will appear to take the demands seriously to keep the criminal talking, while at some level everyone knows how it is going to play out. And Boyega conveys the fact that it is now not just about \u2013 or not at all about \u2013 the money which he knows he is not going to get. It is about being heard. Then there is the weird, Stockholm-syndrome solidarity developing between Brian and the bank staff, based partly on their growing appreciation of his troubled humanity and also their (understandable) suspicion that they will be collateral damage if armed police storm the bank.There is also the question of racism. Brian asks one bank clerk if they have ever been robbed before and what happened to the robber. \u201cArrested\u201d she replies, from which Brian grimly concludes that this man must have been white \u2013 a terrible omen.This is a well-crafted film but there are, perhaps inevitably, hints of Zucker-Abrahams cliche in the caring TV news journalist (Connie Britton) who talks to Brian on the phone and the negotiator (Williams) whose integrity is at odds with his cynical bosses who might want to solve the situation with a sniper\u2019s bullet instead of reaching out to Brian and talking him down. Basically, nothing much evolves or changes in the film\u2019s various personae as it plays out, almost in real time: the brief flashbacks to Brian\u2019s military service and to his later bureaucratic ordeals in the VA office are all telling us what we pretty well knew already. Boyega\u2019s performance has an essential sympathy and dignity that are vital to this drama; an unshowy sense of self-worth that keeps it together.Breaking screened at the Sundance film festival and is released in the UK on 27 March on digital platforms.","560":"Thaddeus and Nanci, the subjects of Laura Plancarte\u2019s intimate documentary, make for an idiosyncratic couple. While the bubbly Nanci has a natural, charismatic openness, Thaddeus is much more elusive and reserved. Still, their differences run deeper than a matter of contrasting personalities. Thaddeus, born into the Northern Cheyenne tribe, was removed from his Native American community at a young age. Meanwhile, Nanci, who is white, grew up on a Lakota reservation.Despite the differences in their backgrounds, what Nanci and Thaddeus do share \u2013 apart from their love for each other \u2013 is a difficult childhood, marred by domestic abuse and financial precariousness \u2013 the same stories of disenfranchisement that ripple through generations of Native Americans living in Montana. Conversations that Thaddeus and Nanci have with their friends and neighbours make free mention of suicide and addiction, spoken with a tragic matter-of-factness.These intergenerational traumas form a wedge between the pair as they prepare for their wedding. Thaddeus wants Nanci to adhere to the traditional roles of a Northern Cheyenne woman; this means leaving all the household domestic responsibilities to her. On the other hand, Nanci, who has a PhD and works at a university, feels sorely burdened by these expectations. Still, while Thaddeus\u2019s attitude is outdated, the film as well as Nanci don\u2019t make simple judgment calls \u2013 both acknowledge that such mindsets stem from an innate need to cling to one\u2019s disappearing heritage.While several of Plancarte\u2019s stylistic choices are at times odd, including an on-the-nose inclusion of Ben Rogers\u2019s Cowboys and Indians tune, the film is a heartfelt ode to the resilience of love that can triumph over differences. Non Western is available on 21 January on True Story","561":"Firouzeh Khosrovani\u2019s autobiographical documentary opens in a grand yet sparely decorated drawing room, painted in white. As an unhurried tracking shot pulls viewers into the strangely still space, a sense of mystery permeates: nearly all the furniture is draped in ivory-coloured cloth. Indeed, the film operates like an act of unveiling. Peering through the hazy gauze of the past, Khosrovani explores her parents\u2019 complex against the shifting tides of Iranian history.On her wedding day, Khosrovani\u2019s mother, Tayi, married with only a photograph of her father, Hossein, present, while he was studying radiology in Switzerland. Having grown up in a religious household in Iran, Tayi was never at ease in Geneva, where she spent the early years of her marriage. When she became pregnant with Firouzeh, she urged a reluctant Hossein to return to Tehran, right on the brink of the Iranian revolution.Photos, home videos and archival newsreels comprise the bulk of the film\u2019s visual materials, showing how personal and collective memories deeply intertwine. Khosrovani deploys her family archive in a startling way. Instead of a simple slideshow, the camera gazes directly at the photos for an extended period, the slight unsteadiness in each shot mirroring the turbulence that soon seeped into the marriage. With an 18-year age gap between them, the couple had markedly different attitudes to their home country. Moreover, the more secular Hossein treasured western classical music, while Tayi became increasingly devout and conservative as the Iranian regime changed.Still, these changes are observed without judgment, but with a child\u2019s empathetic curiosity about their parents. While the audio re-enactment of Tayi and Hossein\u2019s conversations are occasionally overly narrativised, this is a beautifully crafted work of family history with an especially powerful ending. Radiograph of a Family is in cinemas from 21 January.","562":"Here is an intriguing cine-novella from Georgian film-maker Tamar Shavgulidze, which is at first unassumingly contemporary and realist, but which then takes a deadpan left turn into something really strange; it becomes like something from the 1960s counterculture, yet is as coolly paced and controlled as everything that has gone before.Initially, Comets seems like a straightforwardly bittersweet \u201creunion\u201d tale, full of poignant regret. Nana (Ketevan Gegeshidze) is a middle-aged widow who is pottering about her garden one sunlit afternoon, squabbling mildly with her grownup daughter Irina (Ekaterine Kalatozishvili), when suddenly they have a visitor: a rather stylishly attired woman of Nana\u2019s age, also called Irina (Nino Kasradze). This is the person with whom Nana had a semi-secret love affair when they were teenagers, which caused much local scandal. Irina ran away to begin a glamorous existence in Krakow and Berlin and Nana blandly (or perhaps penitentially) stayed in her home town and had children: Irina is of course named after her lost love and like the older Irina she exasperates Nana by wearing sunglasses to conceal her mood.There is much sadness in Nana\u2019s life, particularly in her relationship with her late husband. The two women\u2019s conversation now is interspersed with flashback scenes of them together in this very same garden, the two being played as teenagers by Mariam Iremashvili and Nina Mazodier. What is there between them now? Reproach? Sadness? Or a flash of something else \u2014 maybe that they could still revive their old feelings, because what on earth have they got to lose? Love is a comet that blazes into our lives all too rarely.But could it be that as young people Nana and Irina experienced something else: something even more unearthly and exalting and intergalactic? A visitation of something rich and strange, something that made sense of how alien they felt? An interesting experiment in the alternative reality that is love. Comets is available on 18 January on Mubi","563":"Based on a true story, Save the Cinema is the kind of plucky underdog feelgood slop that the British film industry churns out on a regular basis, largely to the indifference of audiences. It tells of a small Welsh community that bands together to save their listed art deco cinema (which also doubles as the home for the local youth theatre) from shifty developers who want to pull it down and build a mall.It\u2019s an Ealing-alike gentle comedy populated by lovable eccentrics, and in Samantha Morton and Jonathan Pryce punches considerably above its weight in terms of casting. But the film-making decisions \u2013 from a score that sounds as though it was borrowed from an advertisement for life insurance, to the toffee and treacle colour palette, to a screenplay that is amiable, inoffensive but rarely funny \u2013 suggest that perhaps the cinema wasn\u2019t worth saving after all. In cinemas and on Sky Home Cinema","564":"\u201cAlvin Ailey is black and universal,\u201d says the actor Cicely Tyson as she presents him with a lifetime achievement award in a clip from 1988 that opens this thoughtful documentary about the African American dancer and choreographer. Film-maker Jamila Wignot pays particular attention to the specificity of Ailey\u2019s black influences: the church, blues music and his southern upbringing, all of which informed his best-known work, Revelations (1960).Though Ailey was widely acclaimed, interviews with his former dancers, including Judith Jamison and George Faison, reveal the extent of his personal alienation. Being \u201cthe only one\u201d in the predominantly white field of modern dance was only one aspect of his plight. Wignot subtly teases out the fact that despite having relationships with men, Ailey was not integrated into the queer community. He died from Aids-related complications, aged 58, in 1989.Ailey\u2019s story is interspersed with rehearsal scenes of a new work celebrating the 50th anniversary of the company he founded. Yet behind-the-scenes images of the dancers preparing for Lazarus are never as interesting or as graceful as the archive footage of Ailey himself.In cinemas and on demand","565":"In the Russian-Jewish community of Brighton Beach in Brooklyn in the 1980s, gay yeshiva student David (Samuel H Levine) is having an identity crisis. Closely monitored by his overbearing parents, he moves in with his newly widowed grandfather, Josef (Ron Rifkin), on the basis that he will complete the building\u2019s \u201cminyan\u201d \u2013 the minimum number of people needed for communal worship. Josef\u2019s apartment is only a few blocks away, but in such a tight-knit community it might as well be another country. From this new home, David begins to explore his sexuality, taking the train to a gay bar in the East Village, embarking on an affair with a gorgeous bartender, and reading James Baldwin\u2019s Giovanni\u2019s Room in the local library.The film\u2019s bluesy woodwind score has a teasing, goading quality that feels tinged with melancholy; the spectre of Aids hovers around the film\u2019s edges. What\u2019s most interesting about Eric Steel\u2019s tender coming-of-age drama is the queerness hiding in plain sight. When fixing the toilet of the two men who live next door, David clocks that there\u2019s only one bed.In cinemas and on demand","566":"Movies that have the appearance of being filmed in a single continuous take usually raise two questions. First, is this actually a \u201cone-shot\u201d production (and if not, can you see the joins)? Second, does the format actively benefit the drama or is it merely a gimmick? Alfred Hitchcock famously referred to his experimental 1948 stage-to-screen adaptation of Rope as a \u201cstunt\u201d, and admitted to Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut: \u201cI really don\u2019t know how I came to indulge in it.\u201d More than six decades later, Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu\u2019s wildly overrated 2015 best picture Oscar-winner Birdman felt similarly indulgent \u2013 technically dazzling but ultimately hollow.Perhaps the greatest compliment I can pay actor turned director Philip Barantini\u2019s low-budget Brit pic Boiling Point (co-written with James Cummings) is to say that I frequently forgot I was watching a brilliantly orchestrated one-shot film. Not that the format isn\u2019t effective \u2013 far from it. It\u2019s utterly immersive, conjuring the raw experience of an inexorably accelerating panic attack. Yet, like the 2015 German thriller Victoria, which was similarly captured in an authentic single take, this is first and foremost a gripping and gritty drama in which the spiralling descent of the narrative is enhanced and enriched by uninterrupted digital photography.Stephen Graham, who was so brilliant in last year\u2019s BBC mini-series Time, and who gets an executive producer credit here, is on fire as Andy Jones, the already rattled head chef whose world is teetering on the brink of chaos. We first meet him scurrying through the crepuscular streets of London \u2013 late for work and ensconced in some on-the-hoof phone pleading that succinctly establishes the collapse of his family life. In the restaurant kitchen where his arrival is overdue, stalwart team leader Carly (Bifa winner Vinette Robinson) and her exasperated colleague Freeman (Ray Panthaki) are holding the fort, something that\u2019s clearly become an increasingly common situation of late \u2013 another deftly delivered detail.Andy is overwrought (the Friday-before-Christmas rush is upon them), and swearily takes his stress out on others, his anxiety levels stoked by a visit from a patronisingly pernickety environmental health officer. Meanwhile, out in the restaurant, a rogues gallery of customers must be served. They range from a gaggle of social media influencers who are indulged rather than ejected, to an irate, racist patriarch performatively throwing his weight around on table seven. As for the soon-to-be engaged couple on table 13, they\u2019ve flagged up a nut allergy that needs to be prioritised by the already overworked staff.And then there is Alistair Skye, a celebrity chef to whom Andy is uncomfortably indebted, played with brilliantly passive-aggressive smarm by Jason Flemyng. On the surface, Alistair is all smiles, assuring Andy that \u201cwe\u2019re here to support you\u201d, and insisting that he needn\u2019t worry about the feared food critic with whom he has arrived (\u201cYou don\u2019t need my endorsement, there\u2019s such a buzz in this place!\u201d). Yet soon enough, Alistair is taking credit for Andy\u2019s menu (\u201cI recognise all these dishes\u201d) and offering smug serving suggestions (\u201cCould I just get a little ramekin dish with some za\u2019atar?\u201d) while making increasingly threatening noises that reveal a deeper, more desperate purpose.Bifa-winning director of photography Matthew Lewis (who also shot the 2019 short from which this feature was born) leads us with superbly unobtrusive skill through this wholly believable hectic world. It\u2019s a world in which everyone has a story, from the nervous young saucier hiding his forearms beneath untucked sleeves, to the game-faced ma\u00eetre d\u2019 weepily phoning her father from the toilets, and the cocky chancer indulging in covert backstreet liaisons by the bins. Subplots about overdue pay increases and overstretched ambitions swirl amid the cacophony of standoffs and service bells (plaudits to the sound team), each thread skilfully interwoven into a complex mosaic of individual voices, all rising to a single scream.The result is a spicy nerve-jangler served with a chargrilled side order of jet-black gallows humour \u2013 a divine comedy barrelling towards inevitable tragedy, played out in hell\u2019s kitchen where someone is bound to get burned.In cinemas and on digital platforms","567":"Diane Kruger slapping Jessica Chastain across the face with a frozen fish should be funny. The scene, sadly not played for laughs, is one of many wasted opportunities in this lacklustre action thriller. Chastain\u2019s Mace and Kruger\u2019s Marie, along with Khadijah (Lupita Nyong\u2019o) and Graciela (Pen\u00e9lope Cruz), are international spies who team up to retrieve a \u201cdeadly cybertool\u201d that\u2019s fallen into the wrong hands.Simon Kinberg\u2019s film feels aggressively focus-grouped for the girl-boss crowd. \u201cJames Bond never had to deal with real life,\u201d says mother-of-two Graciela with an eye roll. Winking dialogue about how women have been erased from history is similarly crowbarred in. Kruger smoulders as a German goth with daddy issues, and the only agent with any sort of swagger; Nyong\u2019o, resplendent in a sweater vest, plays a tech specialist. Cruz is as luminous as ever, despite the fact that her role is mostly limited to crying and holding the phone. \u201cWe need another round\u2026 or like 10!\u201d jokes Mace. Not even a post-mission pint in Morocco can liven up the gang\u2019s tepid chemistry.","568":"The architectural quirks and flaws of a given space are harnessed to explore the tensions within the family inhabiting it: Stephen Karam\u2019s The Humans is the latest in a long line of films to employ a device that was most recently used to impressive effect in Sean Durkin\u2019s The Nest. But while Durkin\u2019s picture was strikingly cinematic in its approach, The Humans struggles to escape its theatrical origins \u2013 the film is adapted from Karam\u2019s own Tony award-winning stage play.It\u2019s not the most visually arresting work, but the sound design team excel \u2013 the prewar apartment in lower Manhattan creaks and groans its displeasure during a dysfunctional family Thanksgiving. The casting is also first-rate, with Richard Jenkins and a wounded, garrulous Jayne Houdyshell the standouts. They play the father and mother of Beanie Feldstein\u2019s Brigid, whose grimly daylight-free new home is the location chosen for dinner, and a dessert course serving of family scandal.In cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema","569":"What\u2019s the point of another Macbeth movie? It wasn\u2019t that long ago we had Justin Kurzel\u2019s big realist version, with Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard. Well, there\u2019s always a point if the film is as compelling and visually brilliant as this. Director Joel Coen, working for once without brother Ethan, has delivered a stark monochrome nightmare, refrigerated to an icy coldness. With Shakespeare\u2019s text cut right back, it\u2019s a version that brings us back to the language by framing the drama in theatrical, stylised ways: an agoraphobic ordeal in which bodies and faces loom up with tin-tack sharpness out of the creamy-white fog.Coen\u2019s visual contrivances have something of Kurosawa and Welles, with some German expressionist shadows, and this looks like a crime drama from the 30s or 40s \u2013 but entirely naturally rather than as an interpretative affectation. Bruno Delbonnel\u2019s cinematography is pellucid and austere and Stefan Dechant\u2019s magnificent production design imagines Macbeth\u2019s castle as a giant, rectilinear modernist house, with chilly courtyards bounded by vast vertiginous walls and corridors that extend like some sort of open-plan death row.Disturbingly, there is no sense of what it looks like from the outside: we are always within its Escher-like weirdness, with battlements that can extend infinitely into the fog. This Macbeth is in many ways similar to the Coen brothers\u2019 black-and-white crime thriller The Man Who Wasn\u2019t There, which had Frances McDormand as the barber\u2019s wife, brooding and suffering, a lot like Lady Macbeth.And McDormand is of course Lady Macbeth here, a role she was born to play, bringing a hard-won domestic authority and her own sort of military determination to the plan to kill King Duncan.Macbeth is Denzel Washington, who portrays the Thane as already exhausted by his great triumph in the King\u2019s cause at the very beginning, a moment at which he might be expected to look forward to retirement. Washington\u2019s signature rolling swagger looks careworn, but his Macbeth submits to both the duplicitous supernatural promises and his wife\u2019s demands like a soldier taking his orders. And then, angry and paranoid, he escalates his fanatical rule with a series of pre-emptive murders while McDormand\u2019s Lady Macbeth retreats into horror and despair.Brendan Gleeson has a cameo as the King, and Coen imagines a gruesome close-up murder scene for him. Corey Hawkins is a fierce Macduff, lacerated with self-hate for abandoning his wife and children to the tyrant. Bertie Carvel is Banquo; Harry Melling is young Malcolm. Kathryn Hunter is the witch apparition who presents herself disturbingly to Macbeth with two reflections in a pool of water and Stephen Root is the hungover porter making gags about erectile dysfunction, hinting at the reason behind male rage.Washington takes the big speeches at an even pace, sometimes rolling over shades of meaning. He sees the floating dagger and the ghost of Banquo but we don\u2019t. McDormand is more specific and precise in her delivery. Interestingly, Coen lets the two do the cheeky \u201cIf we should fail? We fail!\u201d line-reading, which isn\u2019t strictly accurate but has an irresistibly modern sound. Unlike Kurzel, Coen does not directly address the mystery of the couple\u2019s childlessness but lets the issue hang in the air with Lady Macbeth\u2019s lines about breastfeeding. And Coen offers an ingenious new theory about the identity and significance of the third murderer.The movie hits its stride immediately with a taut, athletic urgency and it contains some superb images \u2013 particularly the eerie miracle of Birnam Wood coming to Dunsinane, with Malcolm\u2019s soldiers holding tree-branches over their heads in a restricted forest path and turning themselves into a spectacular river of boughs. This is a black-and-white world of violence and pain that scorches the retina. The Tragedy of Macbeth is released on 26 December in cinemas, and on 14 January on Apple TV+.","570":"\u201cFans are fickle. You never know when taste might change. It\u2019s a numbers game, and I\u2019m going to play it,\u201d says Bodi, the guitar-hero hound from the village of Snow Mountain. While Rock Dog 2 nominally denounces selling out, perhaps mindful of how the 2016 original \u2013 one of the most expensive Chinese-produced animations ever \u2013 bombed, it hectically plays the numbers game itself. Half modern entertainment-biz trawl, half nostalgic Asian rural fable, this messy sequel tries to cover both western and Chinese angles \u2013 and toss around enough scattershot energy to keep everyone happy.Bodi\u2019s power-pop trio True Blue are the hottest new act on the block, their music radiating cyan energy waves out to their following. But they have popped up on the radar of Lang, a music-impresario sheep with a fluffy pompadour and British Invasion accent, who has multiple agendas: not just to separate Bodi from his bandmates by teaming him up with starlet Lil\u2019 Foxy, but to shut down Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll Park where the city\u2019s diehard guitar warriors keep the flame burning. Meanwhile in Snow Mountain\u2019s Tibet-style fastness, Bodi\u2019s family are fretting about his sudden fame \u2013 though, making a killing selling keychains to True Blue-mad locals, possibly succumbing to the mania themselves.Despite the throwback big-label svengali setup, Rock Dog 2 is a very digital-age chimera: all-over-the-place plot, liberal borrowings including a Zootopia-style anthropomorphised city, and fervid pop-culture references from Bill & Ted to the Rolling Stones. The production values seem to be downgraded from the first film: the animation is cheap and stiff, predominantly zooming in on static backdrops rather than featuring much true \u201ccamera\u201d movement, and there\u2019s no star voice cast this time. But younger viewers won\u2019t care. While its generic celebrity-age satire doesn\u2019t bother to root out the original story kernel Pixar would have demanded, it is worldly enough to intrigue pre-teens, and even drums up a certain demented energy for the finale. Rock Dog 2: Rock Around the Park is released on Sky Cinema and Now on 8 January.","571":"By this point there is surely no way back for the clowning profession: every minor horror movie knows it can serve up a demonic pierrot as a bogeyman. With this sequel to 2019\u2019s The Jack in the Box, Lawrence Fowler\u2019s would-be franchise doubles down on the eponymous creepy toy by having its hellspawn harlequin manifest once the crank is turned. It\u2019s rather beholden to The Conjuring (and uses the same title font) and, while writer-director Fowler obviously knows his horror, he doesn\u2019t really show enough imagination here to blaze a bloody trail of his own.The knick-knack of the title is delivered to the country mansion of Olga Marsdale (Nicola Wright), a rich collector of vintage toys who is bedridden with bone cancer. Aware of its cursed past, she activates its ability to grant wishes and rearranges the revolving letters on the top from \u201cJACK\u201d to \u201cLIFE\u201d, before winding the crank. The dial on the top of the box indicates that six lives are going to be needed to achieve her wish; the box\u2019s seller duly becomes victim no 1, and Olga browbeats snivelling son-cum-factotum Edgar (Matt McClure) to round up five more sacrifices. Luckily, wide-eyed Amy (Mollie Hindle) has just bulked up the serving staff by signing on as housemaid.Despite the Hollywood precursors, there\u2019s a distinct strain of English gothic here. Not just in the fusty bedrooms and cellars with blinking lights, which Fowler exploits atmospherically, but in the claustrophobic mother-son relationship. Edgar overcomes his squeamishness towards murder in his desperation to save his parent, with one offering having a particularly oedipal edge.Unfortunately, that is the sole truly sordid moment in a grim trudge of rote butchery, with Hindle and her fellow sacrificial lambs given little of interest to do or say. Fowler pens everyone in with some lame restrictions, including 10ft estate walls in a world where ladders apparently don\u2019t exist, and the inevitable phone-signal blackout. The rictus-grinning demon has it too easy here; real clowns know that a slip-up or two en route enhances the enjoyment. The Jack in the Box: Awakening is released on digital platforms in the UK on 3 January and in the US on 18 January.","572":"Mya Bollaers is a magnetic presence in this Belgian-French film that approaches the story of an adolescent trans girl and her estranged father with good intentions but a thuddingly unsubtle directorial approach. Bollaers brings a fascinating combination of willowy vulnerability and steely fury to the role of Lola, whose father, Philippe (a clunky Beno\u00eet Magimel), cuts her out of the funeral of her beloved mother. Flung together to scatter the ashes, Lola and her father gradually reach something resembling an understanding.The screenplay relies heavily on cliches and contrivances, but there\u2019s one lovely moment that speaks volumes: Lola fleetingly embraces her father from behind, he raises his hand to touch hers, but she\u2019s already gone. A connection is possible, but Philippe has a lot of catching up to do.In cinemas and on demand","573":"The first feature from Benjamin Cleary (after the Oscar-winning short film Stutterer) is a stylish, near-future-set story of love and loss, in which loss can be avoided thanks to radical new technological advances. Mahershala Ali plays Cameron, a husband and father who decides to protect his loved ones from the truth about his terminal diagnosis by signing up for an experimental programme. An alternative Cameron is created; all of his memories are uploaded, and this new, disease-free version of himself is seamlessly introduced into his life.Ali is tremendous in a dual role that takes in everything from a beguiling meet-cute with his future wife (Naomie Harris) to a third act consumed by grief and doubt about whether he did the best thing for his family after all.","574":"There\u2019s a yellow tinge to the photography in George Clooney\u2019s latest directorial outing that makes every shot look like a vintage postcard from the 1970s. And it\u2019s fair to say that this amiable but almost farcically uneventful adaptation of the 2005 memoir by JR Moehringer is also postcard-thin in its plotting and insight.Tye Sheridan plays JR as an aspiring young writer; Daniel Ranieri plays his younger self, a precocious tyke who finds a father figure in his affable Uncle Charlie (Ben Affleck). The young JR hangs around the blue-collar Long Island bar that Charlie runs, charming the grizzled patrons and bumming drinks in return for the answers to newspaper word puzzles. His mother has high hopes for him; she also has cancer, which just sort of goes away halfway through the film. But even with the leverage of serious disease, it\u2019s hard to get particularly invested in JR\u2019s journey from a loving but eccentric working-class background to success at Yale.In cinemas now, and on Amazon Prime from 7 January","575":"Severe behind his wire-rimmed spectacles but more emotionally engaged than he would care to admit, Will (Winston Duke) bears a great responsibility. Over the course of a nine-day selection process he interviews prospective \u201csouls\u201d, all vying for a single opportunity \u2013 to be born and to embark upon a life on Earth. This inventive, daringly spiritual feature debut from Japanese Brazilian writer-director Edson Oda combines a Shyamalan-esque high concept with a dusty lo-fi aesthetic that calls to mind Being John Malkovich.Will watches the lives of his selections unfold on VHS cassettes and a bank of portable televisions; the colour palette is heavy on 1950s municipal filing cabinet green. Pitted against Will \u2013 an individual slightly broken by his own experience of life \u2013 is Emma (a thrilling Zazie Beetz), an instinctively curious and empathic soul. With its score of spiralling, ascendant strings and a final scene that quotes Walt Whitman\u2019s Song of Myself, Nine Days is, in its subdued way, a profound and powerful commentary on life.","576":"A comet is on a collision course with Earth. The targets in this shrill, desperately unfunny climate change satire directed by Adam McKay are more scattershot. According to stoner PhD student Kate Dibiasky (Jennifer Lawrence) and her professor, Dr Randall Mindy (a self-consciously tic-y Leonardo DiCaprio), the asteroid is the size of Mount Everest and due to hit in six months.The pair try to warn Meryl Streep\u2019s President Orlean about the impending \u201cextinction-level event\u201d, only to find her preoccupied by the midterm elections. They attempt to raise awareness on breakfast TV, but anchors Jack and Brie (Tyler Perry and Cate Blanchett) can\u2019t help but give their bad news a positive spin. The only person with enough money to intervene is tech entrepreneur Peter Isherwell (Mark Rylance), who wants to mine the comet for its \u201c$140tn worth of assets\u201d. Party politics, celebrity gossip and social media memes are swiped at too. It feels cynical, then, when Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet shows up with no real narrative purpose other than to snog Lawrence.As Garry Marshall\u2019s cursed holiday trilogy Valentine\u2019s Day, New Year\u2019s Eve and Mother\u2019s Day has already proved, an ensemble cast stacked with A-listers is no guarantee of a good time. Neither is McKay\u2019s bombastic, shake-you-by-the-shoulders direction. The smug asides plastered on screen, and the hyperactive inserts of nature documentary footage do nothing to raise the film\u2019s real-life stakes.In cinemas now and on Netflix from 24 December","577":"Do we really need a remake of West Side Story? Having won 10 Oscars (a record for a musical), including best picture, Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins\u2019s 1961 screen incarnation of the 1957 Broadway musical hit remains a much-loved and much-watched \u201cclassic\u201d; a self-consciously streetwise affair with weapons-grade earworm tunes and choreography that kids would try to mimic in school playgrounds for decades. Yet even the most ardent fan of the original would have to admit that time has not been kind to the sight of Natalie Wood playing a Latina. Hooray, then, for screen newcomer Rachel Zegler, who landed the lead role of Maria from an open casting call, and whose vibrantly natural performance almost singlehandedly justifies this \u201creimagining\u201d from director Steven Spielberg.The story, which transposes the star-crossed lovers of Shakespeare\u2019s Romeo and Juliet from Renaissance-era Verona to postwar New York, hardly needs rehearsing. Suffice to say that Spielberg\u2019s version opens with what could be an outtake from the later stages of Saving Private Ryan \u2013 an aerial view of what looks like a bomb site, over which a wrecking ball ominously hangs. This is the stamping ground of the Jets, the white gang fighting a turf war with their sworn Puerto Rican enemies, the Sharks.Ansel Elgort is Tony, a one-time troublemaker now attempting to put his past behind him. When Tony falls for Maria at a dance designed to bring harmony between warring clans (a \u201csocial experiment\u201d), he incurs the wrath of friends and foes alike. With a once-and-for-all rumble on the cards, into which gang leader Riff (the sinewy Mike Faist) seems determined to drag his old friend, the scene is set for cross-cultural tragedy of love and death.Shot in handsome widescreen vistas by Janusz Kaminski, Spielberg\u2019s West Side Story starts with a strangely subdued palette that bursts into vibrant colour during skirt-swirling dancehall showdowns. Early scenes of the Jets staking out their turf call to mind the ragged street urchins from Lionel Bart\u2019s Oliver!, another stage musical hit that became a 60s screen staple. Yet while Jon M Chu\u2019s recent screen adaptation of In the Heights gave us wall-walking scenes that adventurously turned the world on its side, Spielberg and Kaminski lean into the simpler, low-angle, 45-degree tilts that have become common parlance in New York gang movies.As for the set-piece songs, Elgort struggles to breathe much life into Maria, his voice tinged with a touch of the Tony Hadleys whenever he gets into his upper register. It\u2019s a shortcoming laid bare when he duets with Zegler, the agility of her voice putting his to shame. Odd, too, that Elgort, a hoofer who literally danced his way through the opening credits of Baby Driver, seems somewhat flat-footed when compared to his springy Jet counterparts. Could this duck-lipped, baby-faced Tony really have been just one punch away from murder?Where Spielberg and screenwriter Tony Kushner\u2019s version comes into its own is in the moments where it dares to find its own distinct voice \u2013 nowhere more so than in placing Somewhere in the hands of Rita Moreno. Having played Anita in the 1961 film, a role thrillingly filled here by Ariana DeBose, Moreno, who also gets an exec-producer credit, comes to embody the heart and soul of this new production. As Valentina, widowed owner of Doc\u2019s Drugstore, Moreno provides the genetic link between the past and the present, lending a sense of gravitas to scenes that might otherwise have teetered into parody. For me, her low-key rendition ofthe song is up there with the opening track of Tom Waits\u2019s 1978 album Blue Valentine, rich in fragile, heartbreaking pathos.Other smart moves include casting the non-binary actor Iris Menas as Anybodys, a performance that has something of the oomph of Linda Manz\u2019s brilliant turn in The Wanderers, repaying the inspirational debt that Philip Kaufman\u2019s 1979 cult classic owed to the Wise\/Robbins West Side Story, bringing everything full circle.","578":"\u201cI\u2019m Lucille Ball \u2013 when I\u2019m being funny, you\u2019ll know it,\u201d says Nicole Kidman, who plays the comic actor without so much as a wink. With her pencil-thin eyebrows, corkscrew curls and elastic mouth, Ball was known and loved for her starring role in the 1950s sitcom I Love Lucy. Kidman and writer-director Aaron Sorkin are less interested in recreating her gift for physical comedy than they are in fleshing out her serious side. Kidman has been funny before (she\u2019s a hoot in To Die For and The Paperboy). Not so here. \u201cI care about what works. I care about what\u2019s funny,\u201d she says, forehead wrinkling. Still, it\u2019s a brilliant performance; witty, fierce and technical.Taking place over the course of a single episode of the show, from Monday\u2019s table read to Friday\u2019s live audience taping, the film mostly plays out on soundstages and Hollywood backlots. We also get a behind-the-scenes glimpse into the crumbling relationship between Ball and Desi Arnaz (Javier Bardem), her husband both on and off screen. Both are digitally enhanced in flashback scenes, a technique that is at once distracting and creepy.The film is obsessed with deconstructing good screenwriting, the way a line lands, and ensuring clear character motivation. Fans of Sorkin\u2019s own dense, rhythmic screwball dialogue will enjoy watching Alia Shawkat and Jake Lacy trade zingers in the writers\u2019 room.In cinemas now and on Amazon Prime Video from 21 December","579":"The 1982 video-nasty classic The Slumber Party Massacre \u2013 a confection of polyester sleepwear, orangey fake blood and phallic construction equipment with remarkable battery longevity, directed by Amy Jones \u2013 gets a reboot for a new generation with this, along with a more euphonious title, shorn of the definitive article. This time the director is Danishka Esterhazy, whose previous feature, The Banana Splits Movie, similarly retweaked a near-forgotten property from the pop-culture landfill. After an 80s-set prologue that establishes driller killer Russ Thorn\u2019s (Rob van Vuuren) stalk-and-skewer modus operandi, we catch up with lone survivor Trish Deveraux (Schelaine Bennett) in the present day. Trish is now a paranoid parent, worriedly sending off her only daughter Dana (Hannah Gonera, delightful) off for a rustic overnighter with her friends. Will history repeat itself?Not quite. Esterhazy and co have a few clever-ish tricks up their sleeves that invert viewer expectations. First and foremost is having a second slumber party in full swing across the lake, this one featuring a house full of beefcake boys, all lovingly filmed ripped abs and tousled hair, sinking beers and wantonly conducting pillow fights. The young women, on the other hand, are ready for trouble and therefore much slower to be picked off by the serial killer predator.It all playfully flirts with horror film conventions, offering up a winking orgy of patently fake gore and irony that\u2019s for the most part pretty fun. At least the cast seem well in on the joke and are clearly having a blast, although the package could have been improved with a fewer sharper one-liners and tauter comic timing. At least the cinematography is period accurate, resembling low-budget Betamax from the last century filmed with smudged lenses. Slumber Party Massacre is released on 13 December on digital platforms.","580":"Four stories from contemporary Iran, all linked by the theme of capital punishment and suppression of freedoms, make up this Berlin Golden Bear-winning drama from Mohammad Rasoulof. It\u2019s a typically forthright and powerful work from the director, who was sentenced to a year in prison in 2020 after three of his films were found to be \u201cpropaganda against the system\u201d.Rather than take as its subject the prisoners sentenced to death, the film instead explores the impact on those who must enact the order; who, one way or another, are left with their own life sentences. A father and husband goes about the banal business of family life, but the comfortable existence that his job buys for his wife and daughter leaves him with chinks of trauma that leak through on the drive to work in the small hours of the morning. A soldier finds himself unable to follow the order to execute and makes a decision to escape instead. An older man lives with the consequences of making that same choice. Bleakly matter-of-fact in approach, the film has a devastating cumulative power that grows with each story.","581":"Inspired by the harrowing real-life stories of adopted children who find themselves facing deportation from the US to the countries of their birth, Blue Bayou is an eye-opening glimpse into a dysfunctional side of America. Justin Chon wrote, directs and stars in the picture, about a Korean American man raised in the Louisiana bayou who finds himself targeted by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement just as his wife (a miscast Alicia Vikander) is about to give birth to their first child.Chon\u2019s directing choices are bold and sometimes interesting, but the screenplay \u2013 a big old overcooked melodrama that chucks in everything from a motorcycle chase to a terminal cancer subplot \u2013 is an almighty mess. Kudos, though, for a wrenching final scene involving Chon\u2019s character, Antonio, and his stepdaughter, Jesse (Sydney Kowalske), that lays bare the human cost of an inhumane policy.","582":"A black British spin on the Richard Curtis formula, Boxing Day recycles plenty of the Christmas romcom themes \u2013 lots of extravagant public declarations of love; an entire plot that hangs on the fact that key characters fail to tell each other basic information \u2013 and sets them to a glossily antiseptic musical accompaniment courtesy of Little Mix star Leigh-Anne Pinnock.Aml Ameen directs and stars, playing a successful, Hollywood-based novelist returning home to visit his extended British Caribbean family in London for Christmas with his American fiancee, Lisa (a likable Aja Naomi King), in tow. A charismatic cast inject some sparkle, but the contrived plotting and thin characterisation take some of the shine off this festive bauble.","583":"The latest, most personal picture from Paolo Sorrentino, The Hand of God is a film of two uneven halves. Set in 1980s Naples and focused on Sorrentino\u2019s alter ego, teenager Fabietto (Filippo Scotti), it is at first cacophonous and scattershot. With rumours circulating about Diego Maradona\u2019s signing to SSC Napoli, there\u2019s a fizzing excitement on the streets of the city. Fabietto\u2019s extended family is boisterous, exaggerated, bursting out of the frame as regularly as his curvaceous Aunt Patrizia (Luisa Ranieri) spills out of her dress (spoiler: a lot). Toni Servillo and Teresa Saponangelo, as Fabietto\u2019s parents, fill the story with love and laughter, mischief and marital drama.And then, quite suddenly, they are gone. Fabietto is orphaned; it\u2019s only thanks to his devotion to Maradona and Napoli that he escapes the same fate. And the tone of the film shifts to a more subdued and introspective second half. It feels like the sullen pall of smoke after a firework display. But then something changes. The writing and characters take on a more satisfying depth. Sure, the gaudy pyrotechnics of the early part of the film are fun, but it\u2019s not until later that we start to know Fabietto as a person rather than a passive observer.In cinemas now and on Netflix from 15 December","584":"Here is a bit of a diversion from the Exhibition on Screen series\u2019 usual practice of hanging their films around blockbuster artist names: this latest is a profile of Wilhelm Hansen, the \u201cDanish collector\u201d of the title, who assembled a mighty private collection of 19th-century French painting \u2013 centred on the impressionists \u2013 which was eventually donated to the Danish state in the early 1950s. The film actually takes its cue from the Royal Academy\u2019s 2020 exhibition Gauguin and the Impressionists, whose curators are on hand to provide context.Hansen himself seems a solid if unspectacular figure: a wealthy insurance tycoon whose main biographical drama appears to be getting caught up in a banking collapse, of which he was cleared of criminal involvement but whose financial repercussions forced him to sell a large chunk of his collection. Much of this had been scooped up in Paris during the first world war, when prices for the kind of work he was interested in had slumped.Hansen did, however, have an excellent eye, acquiring works that spanned the full spectrum of early modern French painting, and its classical roots. His chief love, apparently, was the classic impressionism of Monet, Sisley and Degas, but he also worked backwards to the foundational works of Delacroix, Ingres and Corot and forwards to C\u00e9zanne and Gauguin. All these are normally housed in the Hansens\u2019 former country home Ordrupgaard, now preserved and transformed into an art museum.Compared to an artist biography, there\u2019s a little less ground to cover, so this film can afford a somewhat more languid pace than other Exhibition on Screen offerings; the most interesting material, perhaps, is the passages covering the development of art-dealing in concert with the rise of impressionism, and the history of collecting itself. A quiet, reflective film. The Danish Collector is released on 30 November in cinemas.","585":"Home Alone meets The Lost Boys in this trashy half-way entertaining Christmas vampire movie from director Sean Nichols Lynch; it\u2019s a black comedy with some silly splattery gore. Lynch makes the most of a limited budget and his self-aware script is sometimes genuinely funny, too. Still, you wouldn\u2019t exactly call it light of touch and the actors struggle a bit with the comic register. Some scenes leave you wondering: is this intentionally naff or just a bit wooden?The setting is Lake Tahoe a couple of nights before Christmas. Dennice Cisneros plays Olivia, an unpublished author of romantic vampire novels who lives alone; her kitchen drawer is stuffed full of rejection letters. Any jobbing writer will sympathise with Olivia\u2019s decision-making when she rescues a bat that turns out to be an actual vampire \u2013 a hot vampire at that. He is Luke (Nico Bellamy), and Olivia makes him an offer: he can crash for a few nights in her garage while he recovers from a nasty wooden-stake injury in return for reading her latest manuscript. So, while she warms up mugs of pigs\u2019 blood for him in the microwave (\u201cthey were practically giving it away at the butcher\u2019s\u201d), he gives her line-by-line feedback on her prose.The fundamental flaw in the script is that Olivia overcomes her terror of Luke in about five minutes flat, switching to Twilight-ish fantasies of romance \u2013 even after a vampire hunter knocks at her door and Luke\u2019s leather-jacket-wearing vamp buddies begin sniffing around. Barely a drop of dramatic tension remains. Red Snow is released on 6 December on digital platforms.","586":"Maybe you don\u2019t go to Iranian cinema for nail-biting action and suspense. But that\u2019s what you are given in this arresting portmanteau film, the Golden Bear winner at last year\u2019s Berlin film festival. It is written and directed by film-maker and democracy campaigner Mohammad Rasoulof, who has repeatedly been victimised by the Iranian government for his dissident \u201cpropaganda\u201d \u2013 most recently, in 2020, with a one-year prison sentence and two-year ban on film-making. As with Rasoulof\u2019s fellow Iranian director Jafar Panahi, a ban of this sort can be finessed, by playing on the government\u2019s strange pedantry and hypocrisy. If the film is technically registered to someone else and shown outside Iran at international film festivals where its appearance boosts Iran\u2019s cultural prestige, the authorities appear to let it slide, though persist with harassment.There Is No Evil consists of four short stories \u2013 with twists and ingeniously concealed interconnections \u2013 on the topic of the death penalty and how it is poisoning the country\u2019s soul. Hundreds of people are executed a year in Iran, including children. Execution of the condemned criminal is the job of civilian functionaries but also widely carried out by soldiers doing compulsory national service.In the first section, entitled There Is No Evil, the secret horror of the death penalty is the unacknowledged elephant in the room. Heshmat (Ehsan Mirhosseini), is a dull salaryman, who is shown living his ordinary life after the working day is done: picking his daughter up from school, dealing with his mother-in-law, taking the family out for pizza. It all seems blameless and bland until the working life resumes the next day. The second part, entitled She Said: \u201cYou Can Do It\u201d, is where we get the thriller-style tension. Pouya (Kaveh Ahangar) is a young national service conscript horrified at the realisation that he must kill a condemned man. It is his job to accompany the prisoner from the cell to the gallows where he must kick the stool away. Does he have the nerve to turn his own weapon on his fellow soldiers?In the third, Birthday, Javad (Ahangar) is a national-service conscript taking advantage of the extra-long leave given to those who have done their execution duty, to travel to the country and propose to his girlfriend on her birthday, only to discover a hidden horror for which he is responsible. In the fourth section, Kiss Me, a musical cue discreetly hints at a relation with a story that has gone before: a middle-aged couple living in a remote, mountainous part of Iran play host to their sophisticated niece who has been living in Germany.There is great technique in the storytelling, and Rasoulof\u2019s outrage and nausea at the state-sanctioned murder gives the film passion. There Is No Evil is in cinemas from 3 December.","587":"Mel Brooks is the last comic in the world you can imagine wanting to be Hamlet \u2013 although, of course, that role is just another way of getting all the attention. He did play a Shakespearean actor in a 1983 remake of Ernst Lubitsch\u2019s comedy To Be Or Not to Be, but otherwise the Danish you\u2019re most likely to associate with Brooks is the kind you buy in a deli. Now 95, the comedian, screenwriter and director of such beloved spoofs as Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein and Silent Movie has written his autobiography. As the title might suggest, All About Me! is very much the work of the man who, as a young Jewish comic in the Borscht Belt resorts, got his break as a \u201cpool tummler\u201d (Yiddish for \u201centertainer\u201d), his job to keep the guests happy and alert, and stop them falling asleep round the swimming pool.Born Melvin Kaminsky, Brooks grew up in working-class Brooklyn, the youngest of four brothers, whose father died when he was two. There\u2019s a priceless opening shtick about seeing Frankenstein as a boy, and worrying that the monster would get him; his mother reassured him that it would have to shlep all the way from Transylvania, find its way to get to South Third Street, then probably eat the Rothsteins downstairs first. The other childhood stuff is fairly mundane: memories of uncle Lee and religious fanatic Louie from Minsk, \u201cclotheslines full of wet wash\u201d and tributes to his mother, \u201ca true heroine\u201d.Once Brooks enters showbiz, the period he devotes most attention to (45 pages, 15 more than his best-loved film, The Producers) is his long spell writing for TV comic Sid Caesar, an experience that comes across as both the dream and the nightmare of his existence, as traumatic as his wartime service clearing landmines. It was a joyful, frenzied, hugely stressful period that brought on anxiety attacks \u2013 not surprisingly, given Caesar\u2019s volatility: he once held Brooks out of a window by his belt.Despite the ensuing therapy, Brooks seems to have little self-awareness when it comes to his own behaviour: like the two occasions when he menaced a colleague into handing over everything in his pockets, the second time making him wade waist-deep in Central Park Lake. Brooks was simply one of life\u2019s \u201cwild beasts\u201d, he says, but doesn\u2019t look further into why certain clowns might have a touch of the sociopath, or just be a pain in the tuchus.He\u2019s good at remembering where jokes came from \u2013 like the 48th St impresario drying his underwear, a model for the flamboyantly squalid Max Bialystock in The Producers \u2013 but heavy weather when recalling gags and routines: \u201cNobody knew what was happening but it was absolutely hilarious\u201d\u2026 \u201cI don\u2019t know how I held it together\u201d\u2026 This is a book that is constantly corpsing. He\u2019s not so hot at theorising, either: he became a clown for the time-honoured reason that \u201cyou don\u2019t hit the kid that makes you laugh\u201d; New York humour has \u201ca certain intensity and a certain pulse\u201d; and, bottom line, \u201cInept idiots will always be fun\u201d. If you were Bialystock, you\u2019d say: \u201cOK kid, what else ya got?\u201dNot enough, alas, to make this an essential read. Among the minute recollections of each of his movies, there\u2019s the odd morsel you may not have known (the deranged Nazi in The Producers was nearly played by Dustin Hoffman); but strangely, he leaves out the most outlandish story about Blazing Saddles, that screen siren Hedy Lamarr sued over her name being taken in vain, with its villain Hedley Lamarr. Nor is this the most revealing treasury of brushes with greatness: he recalls a joke shared with Bob Hope (\u201cWe both laughed. Life is funny\u201d), advice and compliments from Alfred Hitchcock, walks with Caesar show colleague Woody Allen (\u201centertaining chatter\u201d).As for personal life, Brooks refers in passing to the end of his first marriage, with no mention of his first wife, Florence Baum. There are tender recollections of his long marriage to actor Anne Bancroft, but also an uncomfortable moment, more telling than intended: when Bancroft was having trouble rehearsing a scene, he told her: \u201cYou know what\u2019s even harder? Writing!\u201d When Bancroft died, Brooks says, \u201cFor a long time, I was inconsolable\u201d, but then collaborators \u201cpulled me out of my abyss of despair and we went to work on our next musical together\u201d \u2013 a bizarre evasion of an emotional landmine, and perhaps the book\u2019s most poignant moment.Unless you\u2019re a Brooks obsessive, or aching for a couple of transcripts of his very droll The 2000 Year Old Man ad libs with Carl Reiner, this is not the most gratifying read. Go back to his best movies instead: they\u2019re sometimes uncomfortably dated, in places as creaky as Brooks\u2019s knees must be. But you\u2019d have to be Hedy Lamarr not to find them funny. All About Me!: My Remarkable Life in Show Business by Mel Brooks is published by Century (\u00a316.99). To support the Guardian and Observer order your copy at guardianbookshop.com. Delivery charges may apply","588":"\u201cSomething\u2019s haunting you, Mr Black. I can see it. Hope you get the chance to confront it.\u201d With this utterance coming from Kate Dickie, playing a one-eyed ferry operator who keeps a stuffed crow on her boat, you know that confrontation is a given. She\u2019s just shipped Eric Black (Tom Hughes) and his collie Baxter across a menacing stretch of water to the prehistoric-looking Scottish island where a husk of a cottage and a job as resident shepherd await him. \u201cEscaping or running?\u201d she asks, but he dodges the question. What is left unsaid is that he has just buried his pregnant wife Rachel (Gaia Weiss), something his face \u2013 a study in pasty desolation \u2013 suggests he may have had a hand in.Dickie\u2019s goading suggests this might be framed as another self-consciously salty yarn along the lines of Robert Eggers\u2019 2019 film The Lighthouse, which, like Shepherd, was inspired by the Smalls lighthouse tragedy. But director Russell Owen\u2019s less humorous brand of confinement horror takes a different tack. Eric corrals his sheep, starts glimpsing a jet-black revenant, and is transfixed by a sinister lighthouse prone to letting its fog-bell clank at dramatically emphatic moments; his isolation is reinforced largely through oppressive sound design. Said bell, dank reverb, creaking timbers, ticking clocks and a score heavy on the scything strings all combine into a psychological cacophony that feels like an Alfred Hitchcock migraine rattling around inside Hans Zimmer\u2019s washing-machine drum.It\u2019s a shame that the relentless sonic assault tends to drown out the emotional impact when snippets of Eric and Rachel\u2019s past are periodically shaken free. Keeping deliberately permeable barriers between his protagonist\u2019s waking and dream lives, moreover, lets Owen off the hook for the film\u2019s lack of narrative precision. He does, though, excel at atmosphere, both with the imposing geographic scale and the musty cragside close-ups; Hughes, meanwhile, sparely conveys Eric\u2019s muted agony. In the end though, while a bit self-defeating, this attempt at a maximalist style is ultimately admirable. Shepherd is released in cinemas on 26 November.","589":"Ridley Scott\u2019s fantastically rackety, messy soap opera about the fall of the house of Gucci is rescued from pure silliness by Lady Gaga\u2019s glorious performance as Patrizia Reggiani, the enraged ex-wife of Maurizio Gucci, grandson of the fashion-house founder Guccio Gucci. She singlehandedly delivers the movie from any issues about Italianface casting: only she can get away with speaking English with the comedy foreign-a accent-a. Every time Gaga comes on screen, you just can\u2019t help grinning at her sly elegance, mischief and performance-IQ, channelling Gina Lollobrigida or Claudia Cardinale in their early-50s gamine styles. There is a truly magnificent scene in which Patrizia is wearing nothing but weapons-grade lingerie in the marital bathroom \u2013 and yet somehow Maurizio, played by Adam Driver, is even more sexy in his demure monogrammed pyjamas.Until seeing this film I had no idea that in 1995, Reggiani, through a bizarre confidante and professional psychic called Pina Auriemma, played here by Salma Hayek, paid a hitman to kill Maurizio, so incensed was Reggiani by his infidelity and the resulting divorce. It is like hearing that Karen Millen thought about whacking her husband or finding out that the retailer Michael Marks planned to garrotte Thomas Spencer outside Marble Arch tube station. But there it is.Gaga shows us a Patrizia who is an aspirational young woman, a black-belt minx who is also profoundly innocent, with a secretarial day job working for her dad, a socially humble but well-off haulier. In 1970, she shows up at a Milan disco and meets-cute with gawky, lanky Maurizio Gucci, a law student with no great interest in the family business. He is played with gallant diffidence by Driver wearing a pair of big glasses \u2013 a mandarin-geek look I associate with Yves Saint Laurent.They fall in love, to the furious disdain of Maurizio\u2019s father, Rodolfo, played by Jeremy Irons with one of those moustaches that you create by shaving downwards from the nose to create a kind of charcoal line along the upper lip. He is a pampered former movie-matinee idol who gave up showbiz to rejoin the family firm and now suspects Patrizia of being a gold-digger. But Patrizia and Maurizio get married, an event with which Ridley Scott and editor Claire Simpson create a showstopping transition: Driver and Gaga have full-on sex in her dad\u2019s office which at the moment of Patrizia\u2019s orgasm cuts to her beatific appearance in church in her bridal gown. A sexualised epiphany of loveliness.So Patrizia is to meet (and charm) the rest of the family, including Maurizio\u2019s deadbeat loser cousin and wannabe designer Paolo: a bald, overweight guy played by \u2026 Jeffrey Tambor? No. It\u2019s Jared Leto in some serious latex. And then there\u2019s Maurizio\u2019s genial uncle Aldo, played with a certain type of distrait charm by Al Pacino. This casting triggers a certain question: sure, dopey Paolo is Fredo, but who is Michael Corleone in this scenario? Maurizio or Patrizia? Yet just as Patrizia is coyly masterminding her man\u2019s future dominance in the company, he is ungratefully fixing to sideline her after being re-enamoured of a certain upper-class acquaintance: Paola Franchi, played by Camille Cottin.House of Gucci \u2013 adapted by screenwriters Becky Johnston and Roberto Bentivegna from the non-fiction bestseller by Sara Gay Forden \u2013 is enjoyable despite, or because of, Scott\u2019s touristy, pantomimey approach to Italy and Italian culture. Yet with real storytelling zest the director punches up every scene, often with some very old-school musical cues: trad opera almost every time. (Paolo Sorrentino would have played it differently but maybe nowhere near as entertainingly.) There\u2019s some very broad dialogue: trying to concentrate on his design ideas but horrified at the thought of his dad going to prison for tax evasion and fraud, Paolo screeches: \u201cHow can I think about my LINE when Dad could be DROPPING THE SOAP?\u201d When I saw this, the entire audience flinched as one, everyone thinking: \u201cPlease tell me we aren\u2019t going to get a scene with Al Pacino in the jailhouse shower.\u201d Thankfully, no. But Scott must have thought about it.In the end, this is Lady Gaga\u2019s film: her watchability suffuses the picture, an arrabbiata sauce of wit, scorn and style. House of Gucci is released on 24 November in the US, 26 November in the UK, and 1 January in Australia.","590":"This confident debut feature from Serbian writer-director Milica Tomovi\u0107 fits squarely into a rich but niche subgenre: comedy-dramas that unfold over the course of a party in a cramped apartment where multiple generations squabble and celebrate, revealing submerged secrets as the night wears on. Former communist countries are especially good at this sort of ensemble panorama, perhaps because of the way housing shortages and an assortment of other factors conspired to cramp multigenerational households together in small, brutalist buildings. Meanwhile, the deep bench of acting talent available surely helps when making fluid films like this composed of overlapping, semi-improvised dialogue that push the story forward by subtle degrees.Celts harks back to the early 1990s, just before Yugoslavia implodes into civil war. In a Belgrade suburb, frustrated and barely coping mother Marijana (Dubravka Kovjanic) organises a party to celebrate her daughter Minja (Katarina Dimic) turning eight. The festivity is themed around Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, a franchise then so popular that Minja\u2019s entire class can sing the theme tune in English. Minja\u2019s grandmother (Olga Odanovi\u0107) struggles to find enough money to buy margarine to make a birthday cake (butter, unfortunately, costs 6 million dinar), while her father Otac (Stefan Trifunovic) borrows a three-legged mutt from the family next door for the day to make up for the fact that they can\u2019t afford a new puppy. As the guests pile into the house, the kids run riot in the living room; the adults \u2013 an eclectic mix of fellow parents as well as aunts, uncles and friends \u2013 gather in the kitchen to argue about politics, art and the nation\u2019s future.Tomovi\u0107 and her team take pains to drop period details into the clothes, decor and pop-culture allusions, but you have to wonder if it\u2019s historically plausible that everyone, even in this somewhat arty milieu, would have been so casually accepting and unfazed by Marijana having not one but two gay siblings. Even so, the drama around one of them \u2013 stroppy lesbian English teacher Ceca (Jelena \u0110oki\u0107) flaming out when her ex-girlfriend (Nada \u0160argin) shows up with a new squeeze \u2013 is pretty entertaining and makes for some good bitchy zingers. Other story strands are less well developed and towards the end it feels like there are one too many narrative balls in the air; nevertheless the film\u2019s ambition is impressive. Celts is released on 29 November on digital platforms.","591":"Screenwriter Laura Turner and director Philip Stevens are making their feature-film debuts with this intriguing, slightly stylised and quasi-theatrical piece: stark, oppressive, menacing, a historical drama with a slice of horror. It is set in 16th-century England on the remote Lincolnshire coast, a time when the Egyptian Act of 1554 effectively criminalised Romani and Gypsy people and those who harboured them.Stevens resourcefully uses the blank canvases of wild, empty coastline and forest to avoid the need for much specific period detail. David (played by Emmett J Scanlan from TV\u2019s Peaky Blinders) is the aggressive bully who leads a small community of people farming salt from the marshes; he has made a deal with a Romani called Arif (Javed Khan) to get a boat to take him and his family away from England, taking half the payment up front and resentfully allowing Arif and the other Romani to camp nearby until the promised boat arrives. But David is getting ready to cheat the Romani and is all too ready to cheat his fellow farmers, too.Things are complicated further by David\u2019s sister-in-law Patience (Hannah Douglas), a woman who is aphonic and whose gentle, inchoate, bird-like cries earn her the nickname \u201cLapwing\u201d; she falls in love with one of the Romani, Rumi (Sebastian De Souza), which triggers a spasm of suspicious rage in David, in which his xenophobia and hatred of women fuse into a single paranoid meltdown. David and his relationship with his community are in fact slightly more central to the movie than you might expect from the premise and perhaps the film could have dramatised Rumi\u2019s existence and inner life more than it does, but this is confident, distinctive work. Lapwing is released on 26 November in cinemas and on digital platforms.","592":"As a title for this California pastoral from the sunlit west coast 1970s, Licorice Pizza is whimsically inspired. According to writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson, it\u2019s actually the name of a now defunct SoCal record store chain. I was hoping he was making that up, like Anthony Burgess\u2019s supposed cockney phrase \u201cQueer as a clockwork orange\u201d. But no. It really did exist, though the movie itself teeters between reality and nostalgist-hallucination.This is a love story set in 1973 (Erich Segal\u2019s novel is in fact slyly positioned in one shot), and far too interesting and complicated to be called \u201ccoming-of-age\u201d. A grinningly fast-talking 15-year-old boy meets a bored 25-year-old woman who works as assistant to a photographer taking pictures for the high-school yearbook. She is in equal parts amused, intrigued and depressed when this kid starts hitting on her, and she realises that she is somehow interested in him.Anderson makes glorious movie stars of his two newcomers. Cooper Hoffman, son of the late Philip Seymour Hoffman, is eerily assured as Gary Valentine, a heavy-set kid with iffy skin whose child-actor career in TV and movies is coming to an end, and is therefore turning his various side-hustles into the main event, running his own cockamamie company selling waterbeds. Alana Haim, of the pop band Haim (for whom Anderson has directed videos), is superb as the permanently exasperated Alana Kane, a young woman with Barbra Streisand\u2019s beauty and charisma; appropriate, perhaps, as Streisand\u2019s notoriously quick-tempered onetime boyfriend Jon Peters is played by Bradley Cooper in a walk-on role, as one of Gary\u2019s dissatisfied waterbed customers.The love between Gary and Alana, if love it is, does not run smooth. Alana breaks Gary\u2019s heart by holding hands with another child actor hardly older than he is; Gary infuriates Alana by putting the moves on a girl his own age. Alana retaliates by flirting with ageing movie star Jack Holden (Sean Penn), presumably based on William Holden (why not just make him William Holden?) and then uptight political candidate Joel Wachs (Benny Safdie). But we all know, even if we can scarcely believe it, where this is heading. And this hypnotically gorgeous, funny, romantic movie freewheels its way around from scene to scene, from character to character, from setpiece to setpiece, with absolute mastery. You float and ripple around it as if on a waterbed. But every casual line, kiss, automobile-ride, set-up and joke is a joy.Anderson says that Gary\u2019s character is partly based on former child actor Gary Goetzman who grew up to be Tom Hanks\u2019s producing partner, and partly on a kid he saw in 2001 trying to chat up an older woman in high school. Why did he reposition the story in 1973? Well, he is superb at evoking that era; perhaps an allusion to Harold and Maude is intended, though the nearest thing to cinematic quotation is a scene weirdly close to the political campaign office moments from Taxi Driver. Yet could it be that Anderson has chosen the 1970s for what many suggest was Jonathan Franzen\u2019s motivation in choosing that era for his new novel Crossroads? Backdate your story to the disillusioned-yet-still-groovy 70s and it\u2019s easier to explore issues of transgressive love and sex in the right mood of tolerant romantic adventure without getting bogged down in 21st-century gender politics?Maybe. The ironising 70s might also, incidentally, make it easier to get away with the perennial male fantasy of the teen boy entrancing an older woman (yeah right). The setting certainly allows characters to drive very, very fast to places where they drink very, very large amounts of alcohol: in fact, the driving scenes are rather like those in Quentin Tarantino\u2019s LA-period film Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, and whereas Tarantino had crazy Charlie Manson, Anderson has freaky Jon Peters smashing up cars. There\u2019s also a cinephile fetish-moment where Gary and Alana wind up in front of a movie theatre marquee advertising Live and Let Die (although Edgar Wright got there first with his vision of the Thunderball premiere in Last Night in Soho). We get jukebox slams of Paul McCartney\u2019s Let Me Roll It and David Bowie\u2019s Life on Mars, and in this film we do indeed see LAPD lawmen beating up the wrong guy: Gary.This is lighter and sunnier than previous Anderson pictures; subtract the porn and indeed the sex from Boogie Nights and you have something like it; remove the metaphysical anxiety from Inherent Vice and that comes reasonably close, too. It\u2019s such a delectable film: I\u2019ll be cutting myself another slice very soon. Licorice Pizza is out now in the US, and released on 1 January in the UK.","593":"It\u2019s been a wonderful year for documentaries about Indigenous Australian artists, with Firestarter: Story of Bangarra charting the evolution of the magical Bangarra Dance Theatre and My Name is Gulpilil presenting a portrait, in the spirit of a living wake, of the great Yol\u014bu actor David Gulpilil.Now comes director Larissa Behrendt\u2019s Araatika: Rise Up! \u2013 which isn\u2019t about artists per se but certainly about creative expression, poised at the intersection of art and sport, following a group of NRL players as they create the First Nations equivalent of a haka.It\u2019s not on the same level as the aforementioned productions (being a more modest and unprepossessing documentary, with fewer frills) but it\u2019s nevertheless a warming and compelling watch, populated by likeable people pursuing a valuable endeavour. Splashes of visual bravado indicate a desire to create a more cinematically elevated work, which, while only partially realised, sprinkles the film with lovely images such as an opening drone shot of beautiful green terrain that lateralises the title, moving into the air and reaching towards the heavens.We\u2019re soon taken to moments of action on the footy oval intercut with vision of an Indigenous dancer in the mid air, in front of a surreal brown background: a tableau divorced from space and time. This reminded me of Laurence Billiet\u2019s Cathy Freeman documentary, Freeman, which also embraces athleticism as a form of expression and is laced with visions of Bangarra performer Lillian Banks playing \u201cthe spirit of Cathy\u201d\u2013 attempting to channel via interpretative dance the emotional journey of the superstar sprinter.In Araatika we meet Dean Widders, former footballer and now Indigenous pathways manager for the NRL, who notes that he\u2019s \u201cseen from an early age what rugby league can do for an Aboriginal community\u201d, with its emphasis on teamwork and sticking up for each other. Widders says watching the New Zealand team perform their haka, and observing the pride with which they do so, \u201calways niggled at me\u201d, given the Australia team had no such equivalent.He sets out on a mission to fill this void, consulting various parties for advice and at one point sitting down with Wesley Enoch, artistic director of Sydney festival, who compares watching sport and experiencing art as similar in the sense that both evoke in observers the feeling of \u201cthat\u2019s part of me up there \u2013 you\u2019re representing me and my culture\u201d. He then delivers a proposition: \u201cGet a mob together and come and dance,\u201d and \u201cLet\u2019s make sure the rest of the world sees.\u201d He gives Widders a platform at the Sydney festival for a performance, and by doing so, also gives the film-maker a tournament movie-esque trajectory, whereby the subjects work and train for a big third-act finale.This is an irresistible development (though it takes almost an hour of running time to get there), marking the kind of narrative inflection point that sometimes prompts a film-maker to modify their original vision to maximise a storytelling opportunity. Behrendt\u2019s direction is a little distractible, partly due to the wealth of potential talking points, some of which are introduced and moved on from quickly.About half an hour in, for instance, we see visions of people in New Zealand performing the haka in the wake of the Christchurch massacre and are told it was \u201calmost a way of uniting the nation\u201d during a terrible time. This fascinating connection is befitting of more consideration, but it\u2019s over in seconds. Documentarians invariably weigh up such challenges (ie to include or not to include, and if so, for how long) and sometimes settle on half solutions: resolving that the material is too good not to include, but not providing the space for it to be properly considered.Behrendt\u2019s directorial style, broadly speaking, is that of a cine-essayist, talented at fishing through and arranging evidence, particularly when it comes to political and cultural context \u2013 an approach especially well-suited to her previous documentary, After the Apology. Just when you feel you have the tone and trajectory of Araatika: Rise Up! pegged, it has a habit of unexpectedly throwing something lovely or arresting at you \u2013 such as the sight of men in traditional Aboriginal makeup and garb walking down a Sydney street, flanking the harbour, en route to the final performance, of which the film\u2019s weight and energy is behind.Dancers in this finale include Adam Goodes \u2013 recently the subject of The Final Quarter and The Australian Dream \u2013 and the journalist Stan Grant. The latter eloquently identifies the spirit of optimism implicit in Araatika and other recent docos about Indigenous Australians who have made highly significant contributions to public life, among them She Who Must Be Loved, Gurrumul, We Don\u2019t Need a Map and parts of the Australia in Colour series. Grant sums it up when he reflects on how, during moments such as the time Australians took to the streets in droves in the 1960s to welcome back boxer Lionel Rose from Japan, \u201cYou can believe in something else: that there is another Australia, a better Australia.\u201dAraatika: Rise Up! is streaming at the Sydney film festival On Demand until 21 November. It will air on NITV in 2022.","594":"\u201cThey stabbed me and locked me in a broom cupboard. It\u2019s not looking good mate.\u201d If someone slipped Guy Ritchie a monkey or two to direct a low-budget gangster Britflick it might look a bit like this feature debut from Jez Alsop. It opens at a bare-knuckle boxing match in Birmingham, lairy geezers watching as two fighters pound each other\u2019s faces into steak tartare. Just before the knockout punch, a shifty looking man slips out a side door. This is bookie Daz (Nicholas Clarke), who has fixed three fights by passing professional boxers off as amateurs. Now he\u2019s been rumbled.For the rest of the film, we\u2019re mostly confined in the broom cupboard with Daz, waiting for a gangland boss to show up. The camera keeps close to his face, cranking up the claustrophobia. Daz is a man in lockdown, but he\u2019s not alone. He manages to get his smashed phone working and is constantly on the blower. First up is a call to his girlfriend at the airport. Tonight is the night they\u2019re meant to be flying off to Spain to start a new life (that old crime-world chestnut). Mostly, the people he phones don\u2019t want to know: \u201cPiss off, Daz!\u201dClarke\u2019s performance draws you in up to a point (some of the acting elsewhere is pretty ropey). He plays Daz as a bit of a loser, someone who\u2019s got by on cheeky-chap banter. Now his luck has run out and he\u2019s desperate. The script turns the screws with workmanlike efficiency until the arrival of a sob story intended to make you feel sorry for Daz and it all gets a bit exasperating. The film is never that believable either: set in gangster-movie-world where mockney geezers with necks the size of tree trunks in black leather jackets call each other \u201cmuppets\u201d. Fixed is released on 22 November on digital platforms.","595":"This musical, boasting a lively voice cast and original songs by Lin-Manuel Miranda, has been promoted as the 60th \u201ccanonical\u201d film from Walt Disney Animation Studios. But however well-meaning, this milestone movie could almost represent a creative crisis for Disney \u2013 it feels like yet another step down the cul-de-sac of bland, algorithmically generated entertainment: more Stepford content from the dream factory. There are some nice moments and sweet show tunes, but Encanto feels like it is aspiring to exactly that sort of bland frictionless perfection that the film itself is solemnly preaching against, with a contrived storyline that wants to have its metaphorical cake and eat it.Our heroine is Mirabel Madrigal: a smart, introspective, bespectacled teen living with her extended family in a magic house with a mind of its own in an idyllic village in a magically created valley somewhere in Colombia (\u201cencanto\u201d means enchantment or spell). She is voiced by Stephanie Beatriz, who recently had a small role in Miranda\u2019s musical In the Heights but is probably still best known for playing the supercool tough cop Diaz in the TV comedy Brooklyn Nine-Nine.Mirabel\u2019s grandma is the formidable matriarch Abuela (voiced by Mar\u00eda Cecilia Botero), who lost her husband many years ago, and for whom this magical house was mysteriously created at the time, apparently rising up in defiance of this great sadness. And all of her children and grandchildren turn out each to have a magic power, of which Abuela is intensely proud. Mirabel\u2019s mum Julieta (Angie Cepeda) can heal people with her cooking, and I guess only a pedant would ask why she doesn\u2019t heal Mirabel\u2019s eyesight. Mirabel\u2019s sister Isabella (Diane Guerrero) is a perfect Instagram-style princess who can make flowers bloom with her sheer loveliness. Her other sister Luisa (Jessica Darrow) has super-strength and can lift buildings. Her aunt Pepa (Carolina Gait\u00e1n) can control the weather and cousin Dolores (Adassa) has super-hearing. This is a pretty heteronormative household but her cousin Camilo (Rhenzy Feliz) can shapeshift because he doesn\u2019t know who he is yet.But wait. There is one person who doesn\u2019t have a gift and that is poor Mirabel herself. Yet when a sudden, terrible crisis occurs and all the members of the Madrigal family look like losing their powers, it is Mirabel who must step up and save everyone and everything \u2013 by tracking down the family\u2019s missing uncle Bruno (John Leguizamo) whose own gift of prophecy allowed him to foresee this awful eventuality and Mirabel\u2019s own part in the fightback. And \u2026 well \u2026 maybe this family of fanatical overachievers need to see how their supernatural superiority is a neurotic group symptom of unhappiness. Maybe they need humble Mirabel to bring them to a new enlightenment.So are their gifts a good thing or a bad thing? They didn\u2019t seem like such a bad thing in the film\u2019s opening two acts: these gifts seemed to be part of everyone\u2019s innocent well-being, abilities lightly and modestly worn. And as the rescuing of these powers is the plot motivation, it is an uncomfortable turnaround for these powers to be represented as something to be opposed or surmounted \u2013 a paradox which the film does not acknowledge or resolve \u2013 especially as we get a pretty broad hint that they may in any case be magically restored. This is a flavourless, unsatisfying film."}}

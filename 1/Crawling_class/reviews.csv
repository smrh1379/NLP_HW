"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire review – breezy, forgettable monster sequel","There’s a likable, light-hearted zip to the monster mash follow-up but energy dissipates when we’re stuck with the humans",3,"It was a strange old time when the creature feature mash-up Godzilla vs Kong was released, the first major blockbuster in cinemas since Covid shuttered them all a year prior. Expectations were low, thanks to how rotten the last two Godzilla films had been, but thirst for something, anything, truly escapist was high and the big screen equivalent of a kid smashing his toys together became an unlikely saviour, both commercially and critically.Three years later with normality resuming, there’s arguably less audience demand for another instalment, although the industry could definitely do with another monster hit, the strikes leaving the first few months of 2024 a little weakened. There’s enough easily marketable simplicity to Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire that it should become a swift global hit (the film is tracking to make $135m worldwide in its opening weekend) but, especially in the shadow of the Oscar-winning Godzilla Minus One, there will be predictably diminishing returns for those who venture out. It’s a still fun yet far sloppier outing, a second round that’s less of a win for us and more of a draw.We start out with a truce of sorts. Godzilla remains king, and protector, of the regular world, fighting off creatures of the week when they surface while Kong stays down in the Hollow Earth, the magical other space discovered in the previous film. But their time out is coming to an end, spurred by some dental issues for poor Kong whose infected tooth, and maybe sad sack loneliness too, thrusts him back to humanity. Something greater is also at play, plaguing the dreams of Jia (Kaylee Hottle) who shares a bond with Kong and now lives with her adopted mother (a returning Rebecca Hall), that requires the arch enemies to go from v to x.What made the last film such a success was the director Adam Wingard’s neat modulation of tone, removing the dank portent of Gareth Edwards’s maddeningly self-serious 2014 offering and bringing the fun that Michael Dougherty’s piss-poor sequel failed to deliver. He’s been wisely brought back for more and it’s refreshing to see him keep things light, his film a brash pop of colour at a time when too many tentpoles of this scale get lost in murk (it’s surely the pinkest Godzilla movie to date). But the script, from a team of three, also trying to keep things breezy, is far less effective. Human time is of course never going to be a priority in these films (Wingard even admitted that they would be of even less importance this time around) but dialogue frequently dips from merely perfunctory to actively dreadful. In trying to align itself with Wingard’s zippiness, the script punishes us with quippy banter so astonishingly, embarrassingly unfunny, we find ourselves pleading with Godzilla to silence them all with one of his feet.Hall is ever luminous to watch and deserves every bit of her paycheque for playing Mrs Exposition in the last act but one does miss watching her play a real person, a joy that we haven’t had in a while. Dan Stevens and a returning Brian Tyree Henry are both lumped with the comedy and both struggle to make any of it work, which for a portion of the middle stretch, devoid of crashing and smashing, starts to become a problem. But when we return to the action, it’s hard not to feel an itch being scratched, the basic child-like satisfaction of watching giant monsters square off proving to be just as entertaining as we want it to be. Wingard is again able to choreograph and structure large-scale fights with coherence and logic, especially in the eye-popping final act, taking on a four-way battle and never causing us to zone out (many a Marvel director could do with watching and learning).It’s, obviously, these moments of shock and awe that we come to a Godzilla and Kong movie for but with a two-hour runtime to fill, we start to feel the limitations here more than we should. We’re still supposed to egg the adversaries on for the sake of humanity not secretly hope they might destroy them in the process. If the next chapter ended up being Godzilla Minus People, that wouldn’t be a loss.Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is out in cinemas on 29 March"
Mary Poppins review – Disney’s entertainment sugar rush possesses thermonuclear brilliance,"Manic, magic, madcap … Julie Andrews is superb in the role of the flying nanny, in a film filled with amazing songs",5,"Brilliant, entrancing, exhausting, and with thermonuclear showtunes from Richard and Robert Sherman, Disney’s hybrid live-action/animation classic from 1964 is now rereleased on home entertainment platforms for its 60th anniversary. And it has a brand-new certificate from the BBFC: upgraded from a U to a PG on account of “discriminatory language” from the eccentric seadog character Admiral Boom, who fires a cannon from his roof shouting “Fight the Hottentots!” (an obsolete term for South Africa’s indigenous Khoekhoe people). However the BBFC is evidently not bothered by the foxhunting scene in which the fox has a cod Irish accent (perhaps because chimney sweep Bert, played by Dick Van Dyke, saves the fox), nor by the cheerful suicide reference made by one of the servants: “Nice spot there by Southwark Bridge, very popular with jumpers!”In an upmarket part of Edwardian London created on almost dreamlike artificial sets in California, the prosperous upper-middle-class Banks family are having problems controlling their high-spirited children, Michael (Matthew Garber) and Jane (Karen Dotrice); this is grumpy banker George Banks (David Tomlinson) and his suffragette wife Winifred (Glynis Johns), who is always whirling around going to votes-for-women marches. Pompous Mr Banks saunters into the action with complacent song The Life I Lead (which melodically owes a tiny bit to With a Little Bit of Luck from the stage show My Fair Lady).And so the magical nanny Mary Poppins wafts miraculously down from the heavens to solve all their problems – and this is the glorious movie debut of Julie Andrews, glowing with health and beauty and confidence. Andrews will always be associated with this superb performance, and of course her later appearance in The Sound of Music, in which she also artlessly cures a family’s woes. I have always preferred Andrews in The Sound of Music, because defying the Nazis is more exciting and worthwhile than wimpishly going on a jolly holiday, and feeding the (verminous) birds at tuppence a bag etc. But no one can doubt the lethal power of Mary Poppins. (Naming Mary’s preferred alcoholic cocktail is always a great film quiz standby.)But when uptight Mr Banks takes the kids to his place of employment and young Michael inadvertently causes the biggest run on a bank since Frank Capra’s It’s a Wonderful Life, this stern paterfamilias loses his position and is forced to consider his whole life and how he has been neglecting his children in favour of work (although happily it’s not a quandary he’s in for very long).It is Mary who introduces the children to the madcap chimney sweep Bert, played by Van Dyke with his notoriously awful cockney accent – which is even more awful considering that Hermione Baddeley is right there, robustly playing the Banks family’s maid Ellen, and giving us a much more convincing London voice. (Actually, Van Dyke’s posh voice as old Mr Dawes is much better.) From the first time I saw this film as a kid, and again now, I have always wondered: are Bert and Mary in love or not? Mary sings to him: “Gentlemen like you are few / Though you’re just a diamond in the rough, Bert / Underneath, your blood is blue / You’d never think of pressing your advantage / Forbearance is the hallmark of your creed / A lady needn’t fear when you are near …” Pressing his “advantage”? A lady not needing to fear? Well, I should hope not, though perhaps poor Bert certainly does have a hopeless platonic thing for Mary, possibly the most romantically unattainable figure in film history. She is also arguably a manic pixie dream nanny, though it’s Bert who is also manic, particularly when he does his interminable Step in Time rooftop knees-up with all the other sweeps.There are lots of genius moments here, and A Spoonful of Sugar and Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious are amazing songs. I have to admit that I find the real brilliance of the film is in the first act and things have wound down by the end, but what an entertainment sugar rush.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotion Mary Poppins is in UK cinemas from 29 March, and also screening in select Australian cinemas."
Kung Fu Panda 4 review – Jack Black and Awkwafina in hurricane of slapstick more miss than hit,"The lead pair make a brilliant double act, but the franchise has run out of its signature sweetness and charm",2,"The cuddly kung fu master is back. Jack Black returns as dumpling-loving panda Po, the unlikeliest of lean, mean fightin’ machines. It’s been eight years since Kung Fu Panda 3, and on the evidence here, the delay can’t be put down to KFP4 being a labour of love, the product of animation studio DreamWorks’ A team pouring in enormous amounts of effort. It’s a hurricane of slapstick (some of it in fact very funny) and age-appropriate energetic fight scenes, but lacks the sweetness and charm of the franchise at its best. It failed the wriggle test on my seven-year-old cinema date, who was squirming in her seat around the hour mark.The plot is a bit overfussy for its target audience of small kids, though the scriptwriters have been careful to make it work for newbies – no previous Kung Fu Panda experience necessary. It opens with Po being promoted from his role as Dragon Warrior to spiritual leader of the valley, taking over from his mentor Shifu (Dustin Hoffman – no expense has been spared on the vocal cast). But before he can appoint his successor, Po apprehends Zhen (Awkwafina), a streetwise thieving fox. The two of them make a brilliant double act: Black is adorable, Awkwafina terrific as the cynical wisecracker.Zhen warns Po about a dangerous new villain, the sorceress Chameleon (Viola Davis), who turns out to be pretty unmemorable as far as the franchise’s baddies go (not a patch on Ian McShane or Gary Oldman in the earlier movies). The two biggest giggles in the cinema came from the grownups: first, in a hilarious scene involving bulls in a china shop; then some wry chuckling when Po tries to meditate – his thoughts quickly straying to his tummy: “Inner peace … inner peace … dinner please … dinner with peas.” But the seven-year-old shrugged and said, half heartedly: “The panda is … fun.” Kung Fu Panda 4 is already playing in the US and is in UK and Irish cinemas from 28 March."
"Ryuichi Sakamoto: Opus review – a stark, emotional finale from master musician","In his last weeks of life, the Oscar-winning composer is filmed at the piano by his son. It is an almost wordless paean to a remarkable career",4,"Short of presenting nothing more than music and a blank screen, this documentary about the late Japanese composer-performer Ryuichi Sakamoto’s last appearances is as stark and minimal as a concert film can get. And yet it’s a work suffused with emotional tones and shades, surprisingly not all of them sad even though the subject knew at the time of filming he had mere weeks left before he’d die of cancer.There are moments when director Neo Sora, Sakamoto’s son, turns up the lighting for the more upbeat songs and we can see the master smile, pleased with his own performance, or the composition, or … we know not what, as there is almost no dialogue, no nattering about the life. We had all that in an earlier documentary, Ryuichi Sakamoto: Coda. In Opus it is the music, played by the man himself, that is completely sufficient to the moment and all that remains, with the occasional very human stumbles and missed notes. When he says he needs a break for a while, exhausted by a performance, the strain is painfully visible, audible, practically palpable.Shot in black and white with silvery shades of grey, the camera tends to track slowly or pan leisurely, in sync with the lento to moderato tempi of his playing. Sometimes we focus just on his hands, all the better to appreciate the way he occasionally conducts for himself with his right. Elsewhere, the camera pans up to his face, that shock of white hair, those signature round tortoiseshell spectacles. All the way through, the sound is rich as could be, exquisitely recorded in Sakamoto’s favourite studio.As one might expect given the circumstances, the music selection spans his career – from soundtrack work for The Sheltering Sky, The Last Emperor and Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence, to adaptations of songs recorded with the electronic trio Yellow Magic Orchestra from the 1970s, and on to cuts from his later collaborations with German musician Alva Noto. The austerity of the film-making affords a rare chance to meditate on his range and the variety of his work as well as the consistency of his voice as a composer. Ryuichi Sakamoto: Opus is in UK cinemas from 29 March."
The Persian Version review – feelgood Iranian-American comedy with edge,A perceptive and candid look at mother-daughter discord drives the boisterous energy of Maryam Keshavarz’s comic crowdpleaser,3,"The only daughter in a family of nine Iranian-American siblings, Leila’s (Layla Mohammadi) relationship with her mother, Shireen (Niousha Noor), was strained even before she got pregnant after a one-night stand with a drag artist. But, Leila learns, the wedge between them has its roots in a family scandal in rural Iran from before she was even born. With its boisterous, excitable energy and highly spiced colour palette, The Persian Version initially comes across as a broadly comic crowd-pleaser: a kind of My Big Fat Iranian Unplanned Pregnancy.But there’s rather more to it than crass cultural stereotype. Maryam Keshavarz’s drama is an astute dissection of mother-daughter discord; it’s perceptive and candid in its insights into the push-pull cultural struggle experienced by second-generation immigrants. And it features an infectiously joyous extended family dance sequence set to Cyndi Lauper’s Girls Just Want to Have Fun. If the final act overdoes it a little with the wackily-ever-after feelgood vibes, Mohammadi’s flippantly acidic to-camera commentary emphasises the sharp edges within the family embrace."
Robot Dreams review – bittersweet buddy movie is one of the best animations in recent years,"A lonely dog buys himself a robot companion and learns to see the world in a joyous new light in Spanish director Pablo Berger’s exquisite, Oscar-nominated film",5,"It’s an almost entirely dialogue-free animation, captured with pleasingly simple, almost naive 2D character design. The warm and disarming storytelling is bolstered by the film’s unassuming use of humour. But come to Robot Dreams well stocked with tissues: Pablo Berger’s exquisite, bittersweet, Oscar-nominated buddy movie about the bond between a dog and a robot matches Spike Jonze’s Her as one of cinema’s most devastating and profound studies of loneliness and the fragility of emotional connections. If any further evidence were needed to support the theory that we are enjoying a new boom time for quality animation, then this is it.The appealingly clean, uncomplicated character design is based on that of the source material, a graphic novel by American author and illustrator Sara Varon. She has made something of a career from exploring odd-couple relationships: one of her other books, Bake Sale, is about the friendship between a cupcake and an aubergine. Another, Chicken and Cat, is playfully referenced in Robot Dreams, namechecked on the buzzer for the apartment below that of Dog.Home for Dog is a modest third-floor apartment in New York’s East Village in the 1980s. It’s a solitary existence: the shelves are full of jigsaw puzzles and the freezer is well stocked with microwave macaroni cheese meals for one. But life in 80s New York City is not designed to be experienced solo. Bathed in the borrowed light from his TV screen, Dog slumps on his sofa and plays Pong against himself. Picking listlessly at his cheesy pasta gloop, he scrolls through the television channels for something to distract himself from the happy couple snuggling in the window across the street. And then he sees it: an advertisement for a robot companion, the Amica 2000. Pretty soon, accompanied by a jaunty, optimistic piano and xylophone ditty, Dog assembles his new flat-packed friend.The bond is instant. Bucket-headed and wide-eyed, Robot approaches the city with a sense of wonder. And through his friend’s hunger for discovery, Dog starts to rediscover New York as a place to be embraced and experienced, rather than watched, wistfully, from his living room window. In a blissful montage set to Earth, Wind & Fire’s September (a recurring musical motif, used to increasingly wrenching effect), the buddies scoff down hotdogs from street vendors, watch an octopus busker bashing drums on the subway, rollerskate together in Central Park. At the end of a fun-packed summer the pair venture to the beach at Coney Island, where Robot flings himself, literally, into the seaside experience.Then disaster strikes. The saltwater short circuits his power bank and Robot is left, immobile, on the beach. Unable to lift his metal bestie, Dog returns the next day with his toolkit, only to discover that the beach has closed for the season and won’t reopen until the following June. Rusting at the edges and exposed to the elements, Robot lies patiently in the sand. When he sleeps, he dreams of reuniting with Dog. The ache of enforced separation is dulled by brief connections – Robot with a family of birds that nest in his armpit; Dog with a cool female Duck, who rides a motor scooter, wears Air Jordans and knows how to fly a kite. But both Robot and Dog are counting the days until they can be reunited again.There’s such tenderness to the storytelling, such empathy and emotional depth, that it broadens the film’s potential audience from kids, who will respond to the cute characters and gentle wit, to adolescents and adults, who will recognise the angst and awkwardness of trying to function alone once again. What is perhaps remarkable is that this is Berger’s first animated film. The multi-award-winning Spanish director was previously best known for Blancanieves, a reimagining of the Snow White story set in 1920s Seville, and Torremolinos 73, a droll comedy about a struggling encyclopedia salesman who stumbles into the world of adult cinema.What Berger has created with Robot Dreams is not just one of the finest animations of recent years; it’s also one of the most persuasive love letters to the city of New York. The time and location are etched in affectionate details into every frame, from the period-specific graffiti to the cultural references (Dog is visited by a trick-or-treating sloth dressed as Freddy Krueger), to the East Village in-jokes (a rented VHS of The Wizard of Oz comes from Kim’s Video, a now fabled video store that was run from the back of an East Village dry cleaners). It’s a city that is vibrantly present in the film’s evocative sound and meticulously captured in the background design. But, as Dog and Robot discover, it fully comes to life when it’s shared."
Late Night With the Devil review – diabolically funny found-footage horror,Australian brothers Cameron and Colin Cairnes deliver satire and shocks in this gleeful sendup of 70s network talkshows,4,"A malign presence lurks in the corner, insidiously leaking poison into our minds; it’s ubiquitous and addictive. Small wonder that genre film-makers have long toyed with the idea that television is inherently evil.Late Night With the Devil, a gleefully wigged-out found-footage horror by Australian brothers Cameron and Colin Cairnes, joins a growing list of films tapping into the dark side of the small screen. It’s a list that includes Hideo Nakata’s Ringu, David Cronenberg’s Videodrome, Tobe Hooper’s Poltergeist and the buzzy forthcoming title from Jane Schoenbrun, I Saw the TV Glow. Unlike most of the other examples however, Late Night… focuses not on the passive consumption of television, but on its creation. The film hints at a Faustian pact that trades dignity, honesty, morality and even human lives to claw a share of the ratings figures. Which, when you think about it, is not so very far-fetched.Smart, cynical and at times devilishly funny, the film delivers a crackle of disruptive static to the demonic possession genre. It takes the form of a long-lost master tape and backstage footage from an ill-fated 1977 Halloween special of Night Owls, a struggling syndicated evening talkshow fronted by host Jack Delroy (a note-perfect David Dastmalchian, all slippery neediness and insincerity). Facing cancellation, Jack and his producer have pulled out all the stops: the fright-night special features a psychic, a cynic and, as the star attraction, a parapsychologist and a demonically possessed 13-year-old girl (an impressively disquieting Ingrid Torelli). The scene is set for a live attempt to commune with the devil. But first, a message from the sponsor…"
Swatantra Veer Savarkar review – biopic of Hindu nationalist is self-defeating call to arms,Politically-inspired biopic of Indian politician who opposed Gandhi’s non-violence is hamstrung by its own lack of action ,2,"Of all the hot takes you expect to see when you go to the cinema, the suggestion that Mahatma Gandhi was overrated is perhaps low down the list. But this Hindi biopic of Hindu nationalist leader Vinayak Damodar Savarkar (directed and co-written by Randeep Hooda, who also stars as Savarkar in a committed and involving performance) argues exactly that, although it’s careful to have Savarkar note: “I don’t hate Gandhi, I hate non-violence.” Okay then. In general, the stance across the nearly three-hour runtime is that, in contrast to the famous maxim, the sword is in fact mightier than the pen, with Savarkar exhorting followers to “get rid of your pen and arm yourselves”.What is odd is that the film doesn’t make more use of its own subject’s principles. Much ink has been spilled over the issue of whether on-screen violence is too glamorous, too appealing– but apparently, the makers of Swatantara Veer Savarkar are unaware of what a powerful weapon cinematic images can be, because in a biopic attempting to eulogise a man they depict as having advocated strongly for violent revolution, they don’t deliver much in the way of action.Where it would have seemed like an open goal, considering this biopic’s political agenda, to make Savarkar into a heroic figure who physically battles his enemies, in fact he spends much the hefty runtime studying law in the UK, having little chats in libraries with figures like Lenin, and, for a long stretch in the second half, suffering in the notorious Cellular Jail where the British tortured political prisoners. Of course, making the guy into a macho commando type when he wasn’t like that in real life would have involved playing fast and loose with the facts – but the film doesn’t seem too bothered about that elsewhere, for example glossing over unsavoury details like his real-life support for Adolf Hitler’s Germany, where Savarkar’s speeches were published approvingly in newspapers. It all adds up to a funny mixture of hagiography and limp film-making, albeit built around a fine central performance. Swatantra Veer Savarkar is in cinemas now."
Irish Wish review – no cliche is left unturned in lamentable Lindsay Lohan romcom,The American star plays a bridesmaid disrupting her best friend’s nuptials somewhere in Ireland. Only the leprechauns are missing,1,"There are no leprechauns in this abysmal romantic comedy. Otherwise, though, pretty much no theme-park Ireland cliche is left unturned in a Lindsay Lohan vehicle, directed by Janeen Damian, that reimagines Irish Catholicism as a twinkly, impish delivery system for magical realist plot devices.Lohan plays Maddie, a book editor who is devastated when her secret crush, dashing author Paul Kennedy (Alexander Vlahos), gets engaged to her best friend, Emma (Elizabeth Tan). Invited to be a bridesmaid at the wedding at the Kennedy stately home somewhere in Ireland, Maddie wishes that she, not Emma, was the lucky bride-to-be. And Saint Brigid, patron saint of headscarves and romantic meddling, overhears. Of course, wishes have a way of backfiring, and amid all the spontaneous outbreaks of Irish dancing and Guinness drinking, Maddie realises that her heart lies elsewhere. On Netflix"
Drive-Away Dolls review – Ethan Coen’s lesbian crime caper gets stuck in first gear,"This gleefully trashy road movie from Coen, co-written with wife Tricia Cooke, veers too close to puerile for comfort",2,"Late 90s and early 00s cinema wasn’t all bad, but it was responsible for a crop of particularly dismal crime flicks. Including pictures such as the now notorious Rancid Aluminium, these were painfully contrived and agonisingly ironic winks to camera, made by film-makers who watched the movies of Tarantino and the Coen brothers and figured, how hard can it be? So it’s disappointing that Ethan Coen’s solo directorial outing (his brother Joel having already ventured out alone with the sombre, stylised The Tragedy of Macbeth) is a 90s throwback that feels closer in tone and quality to his imitators than it does to the Coens’ original work, even at their most flippant and featherlight.An enthusiastically trashy lesbian road movie that Coen co-wrote and collaborated on extensively with his wife, Tricia Cooke, Drive-Away Dolls stars Margaret Qualley as free spirit Jamie, and Geraldine Viswanathan as her uptight friend Marian. The pair embark on a spontaneous road trip in a Dodge Aries that needs to be delivered to Tallahassee. But there’s something unsavoury hidden in the vehicle, and a couple of inept criminals on their tail. The film has a boisterous energy, but it’s puerile, phoney and frequently rather cringe."
Phantom Parrot review – eye-opening documentary about Orwellian surveillance in the UK,The arrest of a British Muslim who refused to give up his phone password to UK border police kicks off Kate Stonehill’s look at the state’s excessive intrusion into our privacy,3,"British human rights activist Muhammad Rabbani had been stopped and interrogated at the UK border on several previous instances – the consequence, he says wryly, of being a Muslim man with a beard. But this time was different: the interviewer asked for the password to his electronic devices, and when Rabbani refused – his clients are vulnerable, their information highly sensitive – he was arrested and charged.Kate Stonehill’s eye-opening and at times slightly muddled documentary uses Rabbani’s case as a jumping-off point to explore the Orwellian surveillance activities of the UK; the potential for abuse of Schedule 7 of the 2000 Terrorism Bill and the terrifying amounts of data about each one of us that can be mined from our mobile phones."
The New Boy review – Cate Blanchett is a fixated nun in striking but slow Australian drama,Sister Eileen becomes obsessed by an Indigenous boy with special gifts in Warwick Thornton’s handsome 1940s culture-clash tale,3,"The new boy (Aswan Reid, electric) is delivered to the Christian mission at night, tied in a hessian sack like a wild animal. And that’s how the white world of 1940s Australia views Indigenous Australian kids like him – as feral, unpredictable creatures in need of civilisation.Through the lens of her fervent faith, Sister Eileen (Cate Blanchett) can see that there is something special about the child – he picks up snakes the way other children collect pebbles; he can soothe a fever with just his hands. And he can create a floating spark of light – a plaything and comfort for him in the long, strange nights in the mission dormitory. But the boy’s otherness is alarming to her, something that needs to be contained and reshaped.The latest film from Warwick Thornton (Samson and Delilah) is strikingly beautiful, its widescreen vistas rendered in a scorched palette of dust and ochres. But the pacing is languid to a fault and it all gets rather bogged down in allegory.The New Boy is in UK cinemas now and on Binge in Australia."
The Comedy Man review – manic gusto from Kenneth More’s 60s-style Withnail ,More’s hopelessly vain out-of-work actor is joined by a blue chip cast in a zippy tale that does unfortunately rather show its age,3,"Before Richard E Grant’s Withnail, there was Kenneth More’s Chick Byrd. In Alvin Rakoff’s 1964 British drama, Byrd is an out-of-work actor whose breezy, cynical exuberance masks increasing terror of permanent unemployment and, like Withnail, he is desperate for his agent to call, stunned by his flatmate booking a glamorous film job and stuck living in a scuzzy boarding house in Camden Town (although exteriors were shot in Paddington).After being fired from his job in provincial rep, Chick has come back down to London to try his luck, meeting up with all the old faces, the familiar parade of ageing thespian losers hanging round West End pubs and cafes during the day and mooching desolately past theatres with huge hoardings showing rave reviews for successful actors. Jaded, nasty agent Tommy Morris (Dennis Price) has no time for Chick, and neither does the raffish Prout (Frank Finlay), while slippery actor Rutherford (Cecil Parker) owes him money. But he meets up with old flame Judy (Billie Whitelaw) and a new one, Fay (played by More’s future wife Angela Douglas). And then, when something terrible happens to his pal Jack Lavery (Alan Dobie), Chick makes an awful decision which gets him a kind of fame and fortune, at a price.It’s all performed with manic gusto and plenty of zip in the dialogue, and the opening scene, with Chick’s chaotic curtain-call speech, is in fact rather amazing. But it has to be said there is something a bit dated and tatty in the wrong ways about The Comedy Man, and for me this is down to More, a performer who is oddly pompous and self-satisfied in what is supposed to be a comedy role, albeit a melancholy one. He never looks like a professional actor, more like a golf club bore who fancies himself something of a card. Of course, Chick is supposed to be insufferable – but is he supposed to be quite that insufferable? And then there are the moments of casual misogyny and homophobia, which of course modern audiences can be aware of and even make allowances for, but are here not redeemed by any great wit or humanity in the way they might be for other pictures of the era.Having said all this, it is solidly performed by its blue chip cast – though how sad to see Dennis Price, the legendary star of Kind Hearts and Coronets, not being properly used in a British film. It’s a vivid glimpse of early 60s Britain. The Comedy Man is on digital platforms, DVD and Blu-ray on 18 March"
Phantom Parrot review – cautionary tale of state surveillance and the war on privacy,A compelling documentary on digital war-on-terror laws that centres on a programme that can mean prison for anyone who refuses UK police access to their smartphones,4,"We all know (and are largely complacent) about the limitless possibilities for digital surveillance and data collection by corporations intent on selling us things, or using our existence to sell advertising. Kate Stonehill’s film is about the more old-fashioned subject of state surveillance and specifically the existence of a disquieting new programme in the UK nicknamed “Phantom Parrot”: the practice of remote spying on mobile phone use.Stonehill’s film is also about schedule 7 of the 2000 Terrorism Act, which gives the police powers to search people at UK borders, without needing explicit grounds for suspicion on terrorism. That legislation was brought in before the smartphone was invented, but means that officers can demand detainees hand over their PINs and passcodes to all devices on pain of prosecution and a three-month prison sentence. Because, for all that almost all the information exists on external servers and the cloud, there are still some things which are only held on this handset, to which most of us entrust our entire existence.This was the fate of Muhammad Rabbani, international director of Cage, the group which campaigns for Muslims held under war-on-terror laws, who was held in 2016 on returning from Qatar for refusing to hand over his PIN. So without ever having been convicted of anything, and for having entirely reasonable concerns about privacy and confidentiality as it might affect other people, citizens can find themselves criminalised.Rabbani was represented by the veteran human-rights lawyer Gareth Peirce (played by Emma Thompson in Jim Sheridan’s 1993 movie In the Name of the Father, about the Guildford Four case). Peirce is shown speaking to various human-rights groups and notes that we have become desensitised to state abuse: “The capacity to be shocked is important.” (True enough, although many still had this capacity in 2015 when Cage’s research director Asim Qureshi publicly called Islamic State killer Mohammed “Jihadi John” Emwazi a “beautiful young man”.) Well, this is another valuable film about the digital war on privacy. Phantom Parrot is in UK cinemas from 15 March"
The Last Year of Darkness review – candid and intimate dive into Chinese club culture,"Sensual study of Chengdu’s underground club scene follows unselfconscious clubbers, performers and musicians through their neon-detailed nights",4,"Ben Mullinkosson is a film-maker and skateboarder from Chicago who brings an effortless, freewheeling intimacy to this immersive and sensual study of the underground club scene in Chengdu in central China. The title is enigmatic, but it seems to refer to the imminent closure of a club called Funky Town where his subjects have been hanging out; the darkness is the club’s darkness, which is enfolding and welcoming and reassuring, a neon-detailed night in which nothing matters but youth, beauty and the pleasure of the moment.Mullinkosson is utterly at home and embedded with his group of friends – clubbers, performers, musicians – with whom he hangs out while they (utterly unselfconsciously) get very drunk; and in fact the spectacle of people throwing up in the street becomes a bit of a motif. He isolates a very strange setpiece in which a young woman rocks back and forth in the foreground as a prelude to a gruesome vomiting episode while two people in the background chatter away, entirely unconcerned.Mullinkosson also gets up close and personal while people kiss, or fight. He is alongside a couple who have gone to a high rooftop to see the sunrise over the breathtaking sci-fi vastness of the city, and sees a woman who is depressed clearly flirt with the idea of taking her own life as she stumbles morosely to the edge to see the view better. Another character confesses candidly to having been molested on a certain spot as a seven-year-old. A drag artist has a kind of existential crisis (“I don’t even like seeing myself as a girl”).The director brings his movie to a kind of vibey, coming-of-age climax to David Bowie’s Life on Mars and there is something very sad in seeing all the people involved bidding a kind of complicated, conditional farewell to hedonism.

A Million Days review – low-budget sci-fi thriller asks if we should trust AI with our survival,"In the near future humanity is doomed and our options are being determined by AI simulation – unfortunately for us, the AI doesn’t seem particularly bothered if we survive",3,"This intriguing sci-fi thriller is a throwback to the kind of cerebral teleplays and low-budget movies that flourished in the 1960s: ripe with gloomy lighting and dystopian pessimism, but with barely enough money in the budget to pay for more than two sets. Think On the Beach from 1959, or Seconds from 1966 – but then lower your expectations because it’s not anywhere in their league. But it’s not bad, and the subject is timely.The time is a couple of decades in the future, and humanity has accepted that we’ve messed up the planet beyond repair. The only answer is to start colonies off-world, starting with the moon. Helping to sow these seeds for the future is an AI called Jay that runs simulations to calculate risks and resolutions. All that is explained in a crawl and with faux news footage. The drama properly begins at a rural house that looks like something from Grand Designs; it’s the home of Jay-creator Sam (Kemi-Bo Jacobs) and astronaut Anderson (Simon Merrells, one of those actors you’re sure you’ve seen before even if you can’t quite place him). He is going to be the head of the next crucial mission to the moon, which launches tomorrow. The couple’s last night together is interrupted by the arrival of Sam’s employee Charlie (Hermione Corfield), who is troubled that Jay’s simulations posit not a trip of a few days but one going to the Jupiter moon Europa, and from there the titular million days journey to Alpha Centauri. Quicker than you can sing “Daisy, Daisy, Give Me Your Answer Do,” the trio start to suspect Jay has gone rogue and has her own agenda.Apart from a few moonlit wanders outside to look for a missing dog, and a flashback to a deep-space mishap rendered with visual effects, everything takes place inside Sam and Anderson’s house. That minimalism is fine, making for an interesting contrast with the vast distances and time spans conjured by the dialogue. But a bit more fluidity and flair in the script would have been welcome, cleaning up the clunky, exposition-heavy lumpiness of it all. A Million Days is on digital platforms on 18 March"
Ricky Stanicky review – Zac Efron can’t save deeply unfunny bro comedy,Comedy veteran Peter Farrelly shows very little experience with this puerile caper on Amazon about three friends concocting a wacky scheme,2,"Imagine your husband, or your friend’s husband, or even your friend, has a pal you’ve never met named Ricky Stanicky. This invisible Stanicky character never visits, barely calls and seems to have about one crisis a year – testicular cancer, or a surprise return from charity work in Kenya, or rehab. This would probably be dubious at best, and baseline annoying. Then suppose this Stanicky calls with a medical crisis in the middle of a baby shower, taking two of the hosts away and causing one to miss the birth of his child. That would definitely be annoying.Such is the baseline feeling of watching Ricky Stanicky, a new Amazon buddy comedy directed by genre veteran Peter Farrelly, which doesn’t have enough heart to overpower its puerile humor or its characters’ generally objectionable schemes. For Ricky Stanicky, the person, is a made-up character on which three childhood friends, Dean (Zac Efron), JT (Andrew Santino) and Wes (Jermaine Fowler), have blamed two decades’ worth of misbehavior, starting with accidentally burning someone’s house down in a Halloween prank gone awry.In their adult years, Ricky Stanicky is an agreed-upon excuse – with a literal book of backstories and a fake Instagram account to boot – to get away from their pesky partners, turn off their phones and get blasted during times of responsibility. Times such as the aforementioned baby shower for JT’s wife Susan (Anja Savcic), which the guys ditch for, of all things, a Marc Rebillet concert in Atlantic City, leaving Susan, Dean’s wife Erin (Lex Scott Davis) and Wes’s boyfriend Keith (Daniel Monks) to handle things.Comedy protagonists don’t have to be sympathetic, of course – some of the best, from Wedding Crashers to the Always Sunny gang, have been scoundrels. But they do need to be funny, and unfortunately, these three guys are neither. The joke that they’re immature wears thin fast; the banter feels as stale as flat beer, which is not helped by some very obvious Dos Equis product placement. At the bar, they meet a weirdo named Rod (John Cena), a failed actor turned “South Jersey’s premiere X-rated rock and roll impersonator” who they dismiss as “Weird Al Wankovic”. But when the gang accidentally misses the birth of JT’s son, resulting in one furious mother-in-law (Heather Mitchell), two skeptical wives (women are so pesky!) and one annoyed boyfriend (gay men can be annoying, too!), they know just the unrecognizable actor to call in for the bris …Cena has long demonstrated his impressive gameness to play the joke, and his commitment to the bit of an overly pathetic Rod, an alcoholic failure who performs masturbation-themed karaoke, transforming into the worldly, suave do-gooder Ricky Stanicky is admirable. If only the material deserved it; part of the gag involves staging several Cena-in-musician drag performances to demonstrate Rod’s piteousness, including the lyrics “splooge out my penis! Splooge on my tummy!” to the tune of Alice Cooper’s School’s Out. (Ricky Stanicky boasts a team of writers including Farrelly, Jeffrey Bushell, Brian Jarvis, James Lee Freeman, Pete Jones and Mike Cerrone, with a story by David Occhino and Jason Decker; I have to imagine these bits killed in the room.)Cena as Rod/Ricky is the only endearing character in the bunch, so it’s a bit entertaining when he kills it as Stanicky, endearing himself to Dean and JT’s boss (William H Macy), scoring a job at their finance company and a fluffy news story by Erin, an extremely beleaguered journalist. Dean and JT scramble to sabotage their hanger-on to greatly diminished comic returns. At least Efron, who has long delivered charm in films beneath him (his admirable awards play in last year’s The Iron Claw notwithstanding) can’t help but make Dean a little sympathetic, even with an eye-roll inducing late-stage excuse for his lying. Santino, primarily a comic, fares much worse – JT leaves a sour taste throughout. Fowler’s Wes acts as the film’s chaotic neutral: he’s a stoner for laughs, suggests maybe they tell the truth and casually defuses boilerplate homophobia from acquaintances.There are a few laughs but, at nearly two hours, Ricky Stanicky far outstays its welcome. Farrelly’s direction isn’t remarkable enough to rise above the unlikability of its heroes nor the persistent dick/masturbation jokes, though he did succeed in making Melbourne, Australia, pass for an indistinct version of Providence, Rhode Island, (save for a few extras’ Aussie accents) and in hiring several actors with disabilities. And in making me wish for more for Efron, Cena and everyone else involved. This gang turns out just fine, of course, but it’s an uneasy hang.Ricky Stanicky is available on 7 March on Amazon"
Room at the Top review – Jack Clayton’s 1950s take on toxic masculinity,A rerelease of the John Braine novel adaptation is no masterpiece but sits alongside films such as Lucky Jim and Billy Liar in its depiction of class conflict and young male frustration,4,"“Joe … be gentle with me … ” It’s easy to imagine this demure invitation to premarital sex getting some ribald hooting in British cinemas in 1959. Jack Clayton’s multi-Oscar-winning film was adapted by Neil Paterson from John Braine’s moody, zeitgeisty bestseller, and it’s rereleased now with the traditional trigger warning about offensive and outdated attitudes. Now, that could mean pretty much everything about this film – but without doubt it is specifically aimed at Hermione Baddeley praising the hero’s manliness and grimacing: “Too many pansies about these days … ”Room at the Top gave us Laurence Harvey as Joe Lampton, the smouldering, ambitious young working-class Yorkshireman with a chip on his shoulder and a burning desire to get on, and get laid. Achieving both, he calculates, could mean getting engaged to a rich young woman after (or during) the sowing of wild oats elsewhere to which he considers himself fully entitled. But he’s terrified of being tied down. So Joe is the poster boy for what no one in 1959 called toxic masculinity.Joe travels from his modest home town of Dufton to the fleshpots of Warnley where he’s got a job in the town council’s accounts department. After impressing the typing pool with his good looks (including a simpering young secretary wonderfully played by Prunella Scales), he pals up with co-worker Charlie Soames (Donald Houston) who tells him about the fancy houses for posh people up the hill, the town’s “Top”; Charlie introduces him to the amateur dramatic society where he fatefully meets and falls for two separate women. One is the comely young Susan Brown (Heather Sears), daughter of the town’s plain-speaking plutocrat who is robustly played by Shakespearean legend Donald Wolfit. The other is the worldly, blowsy and sensationally sexy older woman Alice, unhappily married and played by Simone Signoret. (The character, English in John Braine’s novel, is now French.) Joe and Alice have an affair using the flat belonging to Alice’s friend Elspeth (Baddeley).In truth, Signoret probably outclasses everyone in the movie with her charisma and address to the camera. But Harvey’s performance, though more effortful, still has vigour and style. This is an angry-young-man drama from the grimmer and more serious end of the spectrum; it is pretty humourless compared to John Boulting’s Lucky Jim (1957) or John Schlesinger’s Billy Liar (1963), which Room at the Top nevertheless resembles in its drama of class conflict and male frustration in a world where nice girls wouldn’t or if they did pregnancy was shatteringly immediate. In this it is closer to Karel Reisz’s Saturday Night and Sunday Morning (1960), whose hero also has a relationship with an older married woman, and Lindsay Anderson’s This Sporting Life (1963). Freddie Francis’s cinematography is extraordinarily good; he makes these country towns look pretty much as exciting as London or New York and he contrives some tremendous closeup compositions of people’s faces looming disturbingly out of the screen in foreground and background, years before Brian De Palma’s “split diopter” lens effects in movies like Carrie.It’s certainly a film for the Talking Pictures TV audience, and it’s a pungent time capsule for postwar Britain where nasty snobbish remarks could be exchanged at the Rotary club. Maybe it’s not a masterpiece but it still packs a punch, and the scene at the end, where the audience overhears some awful news just before Joe does, is very powerful. Room at the Top certainly defined the life of author John Braine who wrote a sequel, Life at the Top (also filmed with Harvey, in 1965) and scripts for a continuing TV drama based on his athletic Lothario in an act of wishful-thinking autobiographical fiction which earned Braine the mockery of his contemporary and frenemy Kingsley Amis. Harvey himself would go on to make more of an impression in The Manchurian Candidate, but here he still looks like an old-school movie star. Room at the Top is on digital platforms, Blu-ray and DVD from 11 March."
Frida review – intimate dive into artist’s letters is raw and thrilling,"Voiceovers of Frida Kahlo’s writing give us unprecedented insight into her life as she dealt with chronic pain, divorce, infidelity, miscarriage and commercial success",4,"“I paint because I need to.” The revelation of this new documentary about Frida Kahlo (yes, another one) is the white-hot brilliance of her writing. On the voiceover, Kahlo tells her story in her own words, stitched together from letters, diaries and interviews (brought to life by Mexican stage actor Fernanda Echevarría del Rivero). The end result has a raw, thrilling intimacy.Kahlo was rebellious by nature. As a little girl she tugged on the priest’s cassock: “Was the virgin Mary really a virgin?” At college, on course to become a doctor, she wore men’s suits; in old photos, she looks like a beautiful boy. Then came the life-changing accident that nearly killed her. Aged 18, Kahlo was travelling on a bus that collided with a tram. “The handrail went through me like a sword through a bull,” she remembers. In a hospital bed for months – “trapped alone with my soul” – she began painting. Kahlo’s intensely autobiographical canvases appear on screen as she describes the moods and events they depict.Controversially, director Carla Gutiérrez animates some of Kahlo’s work. So the hair on the floor in Self-Portrait with Cropped Hair (painted after separating from her husband, Diego Rivera), comes to life, fluttering down to the ground. These bits have outraged some Kahlo fans. What’s all the fuss about, I wonder. Can it really be worse than plastering her work over tea towels?Then there’s a fascinating section where Kahlo describes stepping out of Rivera’s shadow; it’s like a manifesto. After a devastating miscarriage, she became obsessed with “starting over” and “painting things how I saw them, through no one else’s eyes”. She regretted wasting “my best years on a man”. After divorcing, Rivera begged her to marry him again, and Kahlo agreed on two conditions: a) she would pay half of everything; b) they would never have sex with each other. (The infidelities on both sides had been epic: she slept with Trotsky; he slept with her favourite sister).Each new sentence adds more: more complexity, more woman. There’s the anguish and vulnerability of living with chronic pain; Kahlo is scorchingly sexy too (her love letters practically pulse with desire). She is savage about her enemies (watch out Surrealists) and swears like a trooper. On a visit to New York, where the monied art world is fawning over Rivera, Kahlo sticks a pin in his ego: “Diego is big shit here.” Frida is in UK cinemas on 8 March and on Prime Video on 14 March."
Copa 71 review – riveting story of Women’s World Cup goes way beyond football,The shameful treatment of women’s football after an unofficial tournament in Mexico in 1971 is the subject of this absorbing documentary,5,"Both Fifa and the UK’s Football Association have had an awful lot to be ashamed of over the years, but hardly anything as bad as the breathtakingly spiteful, sexist and dishonest way they treated women’s football in the last century, particularly after the spectacular success of the 1971 Women’s World Cup in Mexico, an independent event defiantly held outside Fifa’s pompous auspices and discussed now in this riveting documentary.An independent women’s football association had held its inaugural Women’s World Cup in Italy in 1970 with sponsorship from Martini vermouth. Then, a year later, they staged their ambitious Copa 71 in Mexico with fixtures in two national venues which Fifa couldn’t control: the Jalisco stadium in Guadalajara and, in Mexico City, the Azteca stadium. The capacity crowds and the euphoric atmosphere were staggering. So conditioned are we to the sexist view of football that the extraordinary archive footage of the crowds for Copa 71 feels like some alt-reality hallucination. But afterwards the FA and Fifa dedicated themselves, almost like the Men in Black waving their amnesia devices in everyone’s face, to denying its success, forgetting it ever happened, clamping down on the venues and facilities and punishing the women for their success.The documentary shows us that throughout the 20th century, the authorities had an almost pathological suspicion of women’s football, despite or because of the evidence that it could attract large crowds; they promoted the fatuous theories that football was bad for women’s health and (in spite of the evidence) that it was bad box office. There is an element of reactionary class prejudice to go with the misogyny in their attitudes: large crowds supporting women triggered an almost atavistic horror in the blazer-wearing chaps. This film speaks to the international players in all the teams from Copa 71 now and it’s a joy to listen to their memories – particularly Britain’s engaging and funny Carol Wilson who, like so many, was badly treated afterwards by the mediocre menfolk.Copa 71 is a revolutionary political parable that goes beyond football. A different world is possible; not only that, a different world was not just possible but did in fact exist. But the narrative was erased. Well, it’s been restored by this bracing and thoroughly absorbing film. Copa 71 is in UK and Irish cinemas from 8 March."
Laapataa Ladies review – Shakespearean carry-on in Indian arranged-marriage comedy,"If you can get with the larky premise, Kiran Rao’s tale of mixed-up newlyweds makes for a gently probing comedy of manners",3,"With a film set in rural India in 2001, Mumbai Diaries’ Kiran Rao directs a tale of two newlywed couples taking a long journey by train to set up their new homes in different villages. Changing trains by night in a rush, one groom grabs the hand of the wrong woman and hustles her off the train with him. The mistake isn’t discovered until they reach his village. Anyone who sits down to this gentle comedy-drama on the basis that its wife-swapping premise sounds like a saucy throwback to the Confessions of a Window Cleaner-style romps of Britcoms past is in for a sad disappointment, but they’ll find themselves entertained nevertheless.It’s not quite as implausible as it might sound: both marriages are arranged, so the couples aren’t familiar with each other, and the brides are both veiled in strikingly similar red marital garments. Plus, it’s late, it’s dark, it’s crowded … look, you’re just going to have to go along with it. There’s even an argument that the classical implausibility of the mix-up helps situate the story in the realm of Shakespearean comedies, where people are constantly passing themselves off as long-lost gender-switching brothers and sisters. The secondary cast of characters underline this: Chhaya Kadam as the no-nonsense station tea shop owner and Ravi Kishan as a grimacing police officer feel like exactly the kinds of character roles you can imagine Miriam Margolyes or Simon Russell Beale getting their teeth into in an English-language version.On the other hand, there is so much about Laapataa Ladies that feels culturally specific, so perhaps an English language version would be a horrible idea. The script, by Sneha Desai, Biplab Goswami and Divyanidhi Sharma, is alive to the social nuances for women in this particular context – Pratibha Ranta and Nitanshi Goel play characters who feel rather differently about their marriages, and who land in very different milieu as a result of the mix-up. The film is neither fully condemnatory of arranged marriages, nor starry-eyed about the practice, allowing for a gentle probing of perspectives. Laapataa Ladies is in cinemas from today"
Defoe review – disarmingly honest portrait of a star footballer,"The West Ham and Tottenham striker considers a rags-to-riches career  that began as a schoolkid, and the scandals that followed, with unusual openness",3,"On the face of it Jermain Defoe, former Tottenham and England goal ace, is perhaps a slightly unlikely figure to get his own documentary, even in this era of wall-to-wall streaming events. He never quite achieved the super-elite status of his England colleagues Wayne Rooney or Steven Gerrard; nor has he established a similarly fond niche in the public imagination as Peter Crouch, whom he partnered up front at both Portsmouth and Tottenham. In fact, Defoe’s story, as outlined here, is in some ways the rags-to-riches tale common to many footballers in the modern era, though perhaps more turbocharged than most given his obvious precocity as a schoolkid.Defoe offers a disarming kind of honesty, mulling over the effect on his life of his largely absent father who, it appears, spent much of his time in a West Ham United-adjacent boozer, and expanding on his admiration for his unswervingly loyal mother. He also touches on a personal life that can only be described as “colourful”, suggesting that a need to not be seen as dependent left him something of a commitmentphobe, to put it mildly. (Even the undignified public scuffle over a failed paternity test gets a mention, with Defoe adamant he was delighted to be a father, as he thought he was going to be.) It is, however, his connection with Bradley Lowery, the six-year-old Sunderland supporter with neuroblastoma who died in 2017, that perhaps elevates Defoe’s story towards some kind of sense of redemption; it’s not too softhearted to agree that, yes, Lowery was the child Defoe has not yet had himself.In all, Defoe comes out of this film pretty well: top-level sports stars are evidently the driven, ultra focused kind of people that don’t really do self-reflection, but Defoe has enough about him to make himself look unusually vulnerable, commendable in a film that otherwise seems to function as a job pitch for a future career in management. As a film, this documentary is not really pulling up any trees, but it gets across a sense that Defoe wants a bit more out of his life than simply playing football. “It’s more than just kicking a ball,” he says, and he’s got more than a few emotional battle scars to show for it. Defoe is in UK cinemas on 29 February for one night only."
Driving Mum review – happy-sad Icelandic road movie hits the spot,This quirky story of a lonely farmer and his deceased mother celebrates the Nordic country’s breathtaking landscape,4,"This film hits just about every sweet spot possible: it is Icelandic and shot on black and white stock; it is a quirky road movie set in an unlikely place (Iceland); and it has a cute dog and features characters who knit. What is not love? If there had been cats and Ian McShane in a supporting role, it might have got five stars.However, writer-director Hilmar Oddsson doesn’t need to pander to specific tastes because it’s clear he knows exactly what he’s doing with this happy-sad comedy-drama, a film that hovers on the emotional cusp between tones with consummate skill. The story unfolds in long, languid, static takes, signalling both a kind of arthouse melancholy that at the same time reads as faintly comical, setting up a frame for funny business to take place within its confines, provided the timing is just right.It most certainly is here, thanks not just to Oddsson but also his cast, led by Thröstur Leó Gunnarsson as Jon, a lonely farmer living in an isolated part of Iceland. In fact, the homestead is so remote, the easiest way to reach it is by boat. Jon, a middle-aged bachelor, lives with his widowed mother (Kristbjörg Kjeld), and their perky sheepdog Bresneff (Dreki, a very good boy indeed). Jon and Mamma knit sweaters using the hearty bulky-weight lopi wool which they sell through a local cooperative. Given the story is set vaguely somewhere in the 1970s or 80s, there’s no internet or TV, just cassette recordings of old news bulletins that the boatman delivers when he comes to collect the finished sweaters.One night, sour-faced Mamma dies. Jon feels obliged to honour her last wishes to dress her corpse up in her finest clothes, apply heavy makeup and drive her to the town on the other side of Iceland where she was born to be buried. Bresneff comes along for the ride, looking alert in the front seat while Mamma is strapped in the back of Jon’s Ford Cortina, lookingas if she’s just nodded off. She may be dead but that doesn’t stop her from having conversations with Jon, criticising his life choices like the time he fell in love with a girl named Bergdis (Hera Hilmar). As the journey progresses, he imagines he sees Bergdis in every passing woman with long hair, and slowly he begins to thaw out and open up to the strangers he meets.The comic style is reminiscent of Finnish auteur Aki Kaurismaki, especially the deadpan way the film uses music. At the same time, this is very much an Icelandic film, one that celebrates the breathtaking emptiness of the landscape. Given how often the country is used to stand in for all manner of other places – imaginary (see Game of Thrones) and real (it substituted for Alaska on the recent season of True Detective) – it’s nice to see Iceland play itself for a change. Driving Mum is in UK cinemas from 1 March."
Tropic review – morally ambiguous sci-fi predicts the departure of the fittest,Director Édouard Salier tells the story of twin brothers training to become stellar explorers. But whether we should accept that space is reserved for humanity’s best remains unclear,3,"A strain of science fiction has emerged lately, especially in Europe and more specifically France, that’s very sparing with visual effects and more dependent on tricks involving makeup and sets, sprinkled with a bit of body horror, à la David Cronenberg. French director Thomas Cailley’s The Animal Kingdom, which debuted in Cannes and played at the London film festival but has yet to open in the UK, is very much in this style, with genetically mutated people turning into animal-human hybrids – lizards, birds, all manner of mammals – and leaving the civilised world behind.Tropic, a film directed by Édouard Salier, who has a horror feature, Cabeza Madre, under his belt, and lots of shorts and music videos – is in a similar vein. It outlines a near future where humanity has accepted that Earth is a lost cause – not just because of climate catastrophe but also because the sun will engulf it in about 5bn years’ time, so it’s best to start planning ahead. To that end, school-age youngsters are training to be astronauts on fiercely competitive and academically challenging courses. Non-identical twin brothers Tristán (Louis Peres) and Lázaro (Pablo Cobo) are both enrolled and hope to get chosen to go up to space together on a so-called eternity voyage. Tristán is stronger, and more confident than his brother; their Spanish, working-class single mother Mayra (Marta Nieto) jokes that when twins are born, one comes out the arse, and it’s a family tradition that Lázaro – the shy one who can’t hold his breath as long underwater and hasn’t yet had a girlfriend – is that one.All that changes one day when the boys are swimming at a local watering hole and some space debris crashes into it. Lázaro gets out with minimal damage, but for sketchily defined reasons Tristán develops a bacterial infection that leaves him with brain damage, vastly decreased mobility, and half the skin on his face looking like bubble wrap. He’s siloed off to the special needs division of the school with other kids with complex issues, some of them wheelchair users, but seemingly most disturbed and emotionally scarred. Neurodivergent Oscar (Alane Delhaye), for instance, delights in reciting super-misogynistic rap lyrics while another (Victor Robert) scrolls through a Tinder-style app, saying to each image: “You’re ugly.”Yes, of course, there are young men with special needs who exhibit such antisocial, aggressive behaviour. But the fact that the film doesn’t present any mitigating or counterbalancing characters leaves a little bit of an ableist bad taste in the mouth, and also seems to imply that only perfectly fit, white ubermensch chaps like Tristánn before the accident and Lázaro are worth conserving. Andrew Niccol’s Gattaca back in 1997 explored similar territory but felt much more questioning of that kind of eugenicist nonsense. It’s not so clear where Salier wants his audience to land morally. There’s a strong sense of atmosphere, however, and the three actors who play the nuclear family at the heart of the film impress throughout and feel convincingly like a tight family unit. Tropic is on digital platforms from 4 March."
Spaceman review – Adam Sandler consoled by unscary giant spider in deep space,Berlin film festival: Adaptation of Czech absurdist novel finds Sandler on a trippy cosmic mission while his marriage breaks down on Earth,2,"Here’s an existential sci-fi wearing its influences and its supposed humour really heavily, as if entering some super-gravitational force field. It is adapted by screenwriter Colby Day from the absurdist Czech novel Spaceman of Bohemia and directed by Johan Renck, who has lately worked mostly on television, notably on the Chernobyl drama series. The resulting Netflix movie is a lifeless space oddity about a commercially sponsored Czech mission to the stars, whose astronaut has to repeat the ad slogans in his radio contact with Earth, always a laboured type of satire.This Czech spaceman is quirkily and improbably sent out to the far reaches of the galaxy to investigate clouds of glowing particles hanging around from the big bang. But all those months alone in space bring him to the edge of insanity, and he begins to hallucinate that a huge spider is in the spaceship, talking therapeutically about the spaceman’s failing marriage. Or maybe the spider is real.But there are no Czech actors in the film and so the comedy of non-Americanness and non-Nasaness in this Czech space mission is lost, and even the implied Tarkovskian mock-Solaris pastiche doesn’t quite work either. Adam Sandler is the haggard and bearded Jakub up there in space, and Carey Mulligan is his pregnant wife Lenka down on the home planet, broodingly hanging round the gloomy house; her video message to her husband that she is leaving him is suppressed by the flight commander at mission control, played by Isabella Rossellini. The enormous spider, voiced by Paul Dano, keeps on addressing Jakub as “skinny human” – odd, as the spider is much skinnier than the human. How many humans has the spider seen?The ostensible humour is assigned of course to this enormous talkative arachnid, like a twee unscary version of Alien. Sanders and Mulligan get no funny lines of any sort, a shame as we know that they can both play comedy. (And Rossellini was in 30 Rock.) As Jakub’s craft drifts out into the golden-hour sunset-hued nimbus clouds of stars, the apparent transcendent experience triggers flashbacks to the first moments of his relationship with Lenka, and we go into a sub-Malick trance. As for Lenka, her role is woefully under-written and under-imagined; we don’t really know or feel how she could have fallen in love with Jakub, or why exactly she’s fallen out of love with him – or why she seems now, as part of some cosmic-epiphanic miracle of intergalactic sympathy, to be kind of falling back in love with him all over again. It’s a spaceflight to nowhere. Spaceman screened at the Berlin film festival. It is released on 23 February in US and UK cinemas, and on 1 March on Netflix."
Drive-Away Dolls review – Ethan Coen sets off in a wild new direction,The writer-director splits from his brother and joins wife Tricia Cooke for a bawdy and brilliant road trip caper about two lesbian friends caught up in crime,4,"During their time as a film-making team, Joel and Ethan Coen developed a reputation for uncanny synchronization, said by their collaborators to always give the same answer to any question even if asked separately. The brothers came to be called “the two-headed director”, but their respective features apart suggest a surgical detachment less than a single brain split in twain.A study in contrasts, the works produced during their brief hiatus – they’re rumored to already be back together, hard at work on their first foray into the horror genre – have given the impression of a single sensibility divided up evenly between them. Joel’s austere, atmospheric take on Macbeth ridded itself of all levity along with its color, and now, Ethan’s road comedy Drive-Away Dolls barrels into their shared oeuvre as its goofiest, loosest entry. Joel’s solo project mined the history of American experimental theater for a bold, charcoal-sketched revision of the Bard’s canon; Ethan’s sexploitation send-up revolves around a handful of pilfered dildos.Far from the result of a trade-off between discipline and personality, however, this bawdy Sapphic joyride is also far from minor Coen miscellanea. It might seem like Ethan (along with wife and longtime editor turned co-writer Tricia Cooke, whose queer identity puts more of her skin in this particular game and complicates questions of authorship) has marshaled the usual plot devices toward broader, more sophomoric ends. We have an errant briefcase nicked from No Country for Old Men, a pair of hitmen – following Fargo’s chatterbox/misanthrope pairing – hot on its trail, and a loquacious wiseacre in the mold of O Brother, Where Art Thou’s Ulysses Everett McGill one step ahead of them on the lam. As incorrigible horndog Jamie (Margaret Qualley, her accent like Tommy Lee Jones speaking at 1.5x speed) and buttoned-up Marian (Geraldine Viswanathan in the straight-man role, so to speak) blaze a path to Florida in a rented car with some unexpected precious cargo, they take a route dotted with recognizable narrative landmarks.But just as the Gulf war period piece The Big Lebowski ferreted away some bruising jabs at American political pathologies in offhanded remarks about Saddam and Bush Sr, Drive-Away Dolls situates its libido-drunk wild goose chase on the eve of Y2K, the twilight of Clintonism and the eve of a conservative resurgence. It’s fresh territory for the Coenverse to annex, as novel as a sense of humor dumbed-down enough to allow for a sight gag involving a tiny, humping dog. And in the most intriguing new variable of all to this auteurist formula, there’s a surprising openness of sentiment, offering the sweetest love story in a filmography constantly, erroneously charged with a self-satisfied ironic remove from its own characters. Jamie’s out here looking for a good time, and the film giddily obliges her without assuaging her suspicion that there might be a little more to life.The archness of technique that’s turned off a vocal faction of detractors has been dialed way back, the allusive streak more incidental than insistent. Jamie mentions having seen a movie like this while re-enacting the notorious glowing-briefcase shot from Kiss Me Deadly, but this is mostly a matter of vibes; Coen and Cooke have admitted that they drew influence from their own half-formed notions of sleaze champions like Doris Wishman and Russ Meyer rather than their actual work. (The real key reference may be Dr Strangelove, which first posited the theory that war, government and the ideologies behind them all stem from the sexual neuroses of resentful, insecure men.) The essence of the Coenesque comes through strongest in the pristine dialogue, with its baroque turns of phrase, absurd circular repetitions, and idle philosophical musings. It’s just that this time around, the trademark colorful verbiage has been applied predominantly to euphemisms for getting off.Whatever liberation comes with this shedding of seriousness also has its costs, most noticeably in the directorial rigor a notch or two below the standard. Perhaps the preternatural ability to place the camera in the funniest, cleverest spot belongs to Joel, though a tender moment spent lingering on the light from a swimming pool playing on the wall posits a more emotional, associative visual language. The characters want to get their rocks off, and the Coen-Cooke braintrust likewise get their stylistic kicks, indulging in wipe-style scene transitions so cheesy that a viewer’s reaction to the first one determines whether they will come along for the trip or get left behind. Interspersed passages of hazy psychedelia padding a svelte 84-minute runtime (featuring none other than Miley Cyrus, graciously undeterred by a lack of lines, as radical visual artist Cynthia Plaster-Caster, to whom the film is dedicated) take tripping literally, and risk comparison to the bumpers from That 70s Show.“After 30 years, not that it’s no fun, but it’s more of a job than it had been,” Ethan Coen presumably sighed in a 2022 interview. A wild detour chock-a-block with wild detours, Drive-Away Dolls comes from an artist regaining his capacity to take pleasure in the process, no matter if that means slackening the laser-focused perfectionist streak evident even in his earlier comedies. Contrary to its easygoing casual gait, this is an essential work in the Coen corpus, an evolution more than a regression or sacrifice. It’s the rare case in which a preponderance of dick jokes heralds a newfound advance in maturity.Drive-Away Dolls is out now in Australian cinemas, in US cinemas on 23 February and in the UK on 15 March"
Dune: Part Two review – second half of hallucinatory sci-fi epic is staggering spectacle,Denis Villeneuve’s monumental adaptation expands its extraordinary world of shimmering strangeness. It’s impossible to imagine anyone doing it better,4,"The second part of Denis Villeneuve’s monumental Dune adaptation lands with a sternum-juddering crash; it’s another shroom of a film, an epic sci-fi hallucination whose images speak of fascism and imperialism, of guerrilla resistance and romance. Villeneuve’s adaptation of Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel – working with co-writer Jon Spaihts – draws on David Lean, George Lucas and Ridley Scott’s Gladiator in the (perhaps inevitable) mega-stadium combat scene with the tiny billions of CGI crowds in the bleachers. But he really has made it all his own: secular political cruelty meets Indigenous people’s struggle in those vast mysterious planetscapes. The sound design throbs and drones in this film’s bloodstream, lending a queasy frisson to its extraordinary visual spectacle and the recurrent horror-fetish BDSM chic which appears to govern so much intergalactic-wrongdoer style.My only reservation is that some of the momentum that the first part had built up has been lost since that movie was released more than two years ago. Those outside the existing Dune fanbase could feel that the ending does not deliver the resounding closure to which we all might, maybe naively, consider ourselves entitled to at the end of 330 minutes total screen time. And the final eventful moments of the film feel a bit rushed, as if Shakespeare had decided to shrink Henry VI Part III into a zappy coda to go at the end of Part II.None of that damages the film’s flair and staggering display. We begin with another extraordinary and surreal desert-battle scene with the invented technological detail that is so commanding and distinctly scary, as if we are witnessing a posthuman evolutionary development. The signature design touches are presented with absolute confidence; in any other film, those black nasal tubes would look odd, especially when the two leads are expected to kiss while wearing them. Here you accept it.We are on the planet Arrakis, with its hugely lucrative mineral resource of Spice, under the hideously corrupt Harkonnen rule, having brought off a duplicitous coup against the Atreides family, to whom the emperor had assigned administration rights. The Harkonnens are the gruesome Baron (Stellan Skarsgård) and his creepy nephews Beast Rabban (Dave Bautista) and the even creepier Feyd-Rautha, played by Austin Butler. The charismatic Paul (Timothée Chalamet) is still gallantly fighting with the Fremen insurgency, in love with Chani (Zendaya) and considered by warrior Stilgar (Javier Bardem) to be their messiah. But Paul’s mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), part of the occult Bene Gesserit sisterhood, is with him also, taking her own place in the Fremen power structure. A great reckoning between the Fremen and the Harkonnen is approaching, and between Paul and the Emperor and his daughter Princess Irulan; these latter are slightly perfunctory roles for Christopher Walken and Florence Pugh.It’s a panorama of shimmering strangeness, now expanded to include a bigger cast, with Léa Seydoux on classically feline and insinuating form as the Bene Gesserit initiate Lady Margot Fenring and a tiny, almost subliminal cameo for Anya Taylor-Joy. As before, the second Dune film is superb at showing us an entire created world, a distinct and now unmistakable universe, which will probably be much imitated: a triumph for cinematographer Greig Fraser and production designer Patrice Vermette. Hans Zimmer’s score provides exactly the right tone, at once plangent and grandiose.Villeneuve shows such ambition and boldness here, and a real film-making language. But I can’t help feeling now, at the very end, that though it’s impossible to imagine anyone doing Dune better – or in any other way – somehow he hasn’t totally got his arms around the actual story in the one giant, self-contained movie in the way he got them around his amazing Blade Runner 2049. There’s no doubt that Chalamet carries a romantic action lead with great style, even though there is so much going on, with so many other characters, that his heroism and romance with Chani is decentred. But this is a real epic and it is exhilarating to find a film-maker thinking as big as this. Dune: Part Two is out on 1 March in the UK and US, and on 29 February in Australia."
Made in England: The Films of Powell and Pressburger review – Scorsese’s guide to cinema greats,"Martin Scorsese, who helped rescue the British film-makers’ work from obscurity, is the perfect person to discuss their unique and now beloved work",5,"The work of film-makers Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger is discussed with passion and authority by Martin Scorsese in this richly enjoyable documentary, for which he presents his thoughts and recollections directly to camera. When the British establishment shamed itself by turning its back on these homegrown masters, it took this Italian American film-maker to rediscover them in the 1970s – and now the Powell/Pressburger films almost cannot be seen except through the medium of Scorsese’s glorious evangelism; their movies and his have virtually become intertextual events.As he takes us through the great Powell/Pressburger films such as The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp, I Know Where I’m Going!, Black Narcissus, Red Shoes and The Tales of Hoffmann, Scorsese also plays clips of his own films, including Raging Bull and The Age of Innocence, showing how he had been influenced by these predecessors. How remarkable that a movie director who came of age in the era of gritty violent realism – precisely that movement which supplanted the romantic idealism of Powell and Pressburger – was to give them a second lease of life.Famously, or notoriously, Powell had become an un-person in British cinema during the 60s, unable to work after critics and distributors had an immoral panic about Peeping Tom, the satirical horror masterpiece that Powell had directed on his own. The film dared to mention the dark voyeurism and hypocrisy detectable in the movie business, the tatty porn economy that helped keep it afloat and the nasty, un-bohemian reality of Soho and the West End where reviewers went to work every day. (Peeping Tom is, as I keep saying, the middle serial-killer film in the overall P&P canon, together with the “glue man” in A Canterbury Tale and Powell’s TV opera Bluebeard.)Scorsese, who had discovered the Powell/Pressburger movies on TV, sought out Powell and effectively brought him back to Hollywood where he ended up marrying Scorsese’s inspired editor Thelma Schoonmaker; it was the cine-creative equivalent of a royal alliance. And inevitably perhaps, given this personal connection, his emphasis is on Powell rather than Pressburger, who was himself living in relative English obscurity, although writing novels, one of which was adapted for the cinema. (The biography by Pressburger’s grandson Kevin Macdonald is probably the place to go for an in-depth study.)But the Powell/Pressburger relationship is one of the most fascinating dualities in movies. They were both credited as writers, producers and directors. “Who called ‘Cut’?” Scorsese remembers wondering as a young man. The answer seems to have been Powell himself, although the directing input of Pressburger was there at a more conceptual level, manifesting itself in their discussions and script conferences, and such a fiercely opinionated man as Powell would naturally never have consented to co-billing without being convinced it was right.Powell and Pressburger emerge from this film, more than ever, as sui generis: inventors of their own kind of film, gentleman amateurs of cinema in some ways – although Powell had served a rigorous apprenticeship working for the Irish silent movie director Rex Ingram. But in a way the Powell/Pressburger movies were a kind of manuscript culture in cinema; they did what they wanted, as if their work was only to be circulated among like-minded souls.Scorsese shows that wartime and the need for propaganda were strictures that paradoxically liberated them to make films which certainly didn’t look like propaganda (in contrast, for example, to In Which We Serve or Mrs Miniver). In fact, The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp from 1943, with its irreverent attitude to the military and the insistence on the existence of good Germans, was famously disliked by Winston Churchill. The result was a movie poetry quite different from anything anyone could have dreamed of, although with the war movie The Battle of the River Plate in 1956 they showed they could do straight genre pictures when required.The title of this film – Made in England – is of course what was stamped on the screen at the end of their Tales of Hoffmann. But Scorsese allows us to absorb the tacit paradox that their films were also made in Hungary, in Germany and in France. Powell and Pressburger were an international powerhouse, not a little-Englander sentimentality factory.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotion Made in England: The Films of Powell and Pressburger screened at the Berlin film festival."
Getting It Back: The Story of Cymande review – the 70s London funk band rediscovered,This Buena Vista-style documentary about a band who found a new life via the dancefloor is overlong but worth it for the music,2,"Described as “the greatest band you’ve never heard of”, Cymande was formed by Windrush-era Caribbean musicians in early 70s south London. Their infectious fusion of jazz, funk and soul was warmly received in the US but largely fell on deaf ears in the UK. In 1975 the band split. The music lived on, however, rediscovered as samples in hip-hop and as floor-filling staples of the rare groove club scene.Tim Mackenzie-Smith’s slightly breathless and overstretched documentary aims for a Buena Vista Social Club-style story of late-life rediscovery but gets a little bogged down in a few too many hagiographic quotes from high-profile fans. Still, the music is sublime."
Eureka review – Lisandro Alonso’s meditation on Indigenous life is striking but slow,"The latest from the Argentine auteur, with a star turn from Viggo Mortensen, is formally​ d​aring​ but often deathly dull",3,"What starts as a pastiche of a classic western – Viggo Mortensen stars as a stranger in a hostile frontier town – takes a sudden swerve into the unexpected when the story baton is passed to a put-upon present-day female cop working a night shift in a Native American reservation. Then, through a magical realist flourish featuring a large bird, the location switches again, this time to the Brazilian jungle some time in the past.This shape-shifting picture from experimental Argentinian director Lisandro Alonso is a formally inventive exercise, one that weaves together meditations on Indigenous peoples and the spectre of colonialism in a form unlike anything you will have seen before. Unfortunately, for all its daring, Eureka is often stultifyingly slow. An interminable static shot of someone sitting glumly in a corridor lasts so long that time slows down, life loses all meaning and, one by one, your brain synapses start to atrophy."
The Taste of Things review –Juliette Binoche stars in deliciously subversive tale of later life love,"Binoche and Benoît Magimel play a 19th-century French cook and her gourmand employer in Tran Anh Hung’s gorgeous, simmering drama ",4,"Sumptuous, sensual and impossibly handsome, at first glance French-Vietnamese director Tran Anh Hung’s lavish foodie romance The Taste of Things looks like just another decorous prestige period drama. But in its elegantly restrained way, Tran’s film, which is set almost entirely in the kitchen, grounds and dining room of the country chateau of famed gourmet Dodin (Benoît Magimel) in 1880s France, is every bit as radical and risk-taking as some of the showier, quirkier awards contenders this year (it was France’s submission for this year’s international Oscar category, chosen over Anatomy of a Fall, but failed to make the final list).Take its exquisite opening sequence. Starting with a wordless nod of approval from Dodin’s celebrated cook, Eugénie (Juliette Binoche), as the gardener hands her a gnarled, freshly exhumed celeriac root, the film then gets down to the serious business of cooking. Around 35 minutes, much of it dialogue-free, is dedicated to the meticulous preparation and appreciative consumption of a feast. In a fluidly choreographed dance of the camera and characters, Eugénie is joined in the kitchen by Dodin, kitchen assistant Violette (Galatéa Bellugi) and Violette’s niece Pauline (enchanting newcomer Bonnie Chagneau-Ravoire).Aside from the remarkable technical accomplishment of this sequence, you are struck by the audacious daring of easing us into a film with a tranquil, uneventful study of chopping, sieving, tasting and savouring that lasts for more than half an hour. Given the pressure from streaming platforms for film-makers to open their movies with full-throttle, audience-grabbing plot dumps, Tran’s decision seems defiant and almost subversive.This luxurious, leisurely opening allows us to fully explore and feel our way around the relationship between Dodin and Eugénie. He is her employer, certainly, but it’s obvious from the outset that, both in the kitchen and outside it, they are equals. More than that, there’s an effortless intimacy in the way they move around each other; the way their heads almost touch as they confide over the precociously sophisticated palate displayed by the untrained but entranced kitchen newbie, Pauline. But it’s not until the evening, when the plates have been licked clean and the last of Dodin’s guests has waddled home that we learn not only that Eugénie and Dodin are long-term lovers, but also that the relationship is conducted on Eugénie’s terms. Over a twilight digestif, accompanied by a chorus of cicadas, he asks her to marry him and she gently demurs: it’s a conversation that has clearly played out on countless occasions over the past 20 years. Dodin persists nonetheless.Tran, whose previous films include the similarly evocative and slow-burning The Scent of Green Papaya, makes a point of emphasising the parallels between the sensual experiences of food and those of the flesh. The grunts and moans of gratification emanating from Dodin and his foodie chums as they wear the traditional napkin over their heads to conceal the shameful decadence of scoffing an ortolan sound positively coital (a now outlawed delicacy, the tiny songbird would be force-fed, drowned in Armagnac then chomped down in a single mouthful). And while I adored the mischief of cutting straight from a luscious and inviting poached pear to a shot of Binoche’s delectably peachy naked bottom, nobody could accuse Tran of being subtle in his symbolism.Yet once again, The Taste of Things defies expectations. There is something refreshingly unconventional about its depiction of the tender, well-worn love between Eugénie and Dodin. It’s not just that they are an older couple – Dodin describes them both as being in the autumn of their lives; Eugénie prefers to think of herself in a permanent summer – there’s also the point in the relationship at which we join them. Cinema tends to be fascinated by the high-stakes drama and intensity of new love or the brutal evisceration of its final moments. Far fewer films explore the comfortable familiarity of a love that has endured and deepened over decades. Vanishingly rare are pictures that capture this kind of relationship so satisfyingly.There’s a serene emotional harmony between Dodin and Eugénie, but also an enduring, intensifying pleasure in each other’s company. It’s a pleasure that is expressed through food rather than words. Dodin’s longing is folded into the paper-thin pastry of a dessert created for the ailing Eugénie. An omelette, cooked with love and eaten with a spoon, is as pure and heartfelt as a sonnet."
Hors du Temps (Suspended Time) review – lockdown memoir revives childhood bliss,Olivier Assayas’ thinly disguised autobiographical study of a film-maker’s Edenic experience during Covid isolation is a civilised pleasure,3,"Olivier Assayas’s new film is a flimsy but elegant autofictional sketch about his own experiences during the Covid lockdown, bubbling up with family members in his childhood home in la France profonde. It’s a movie which reminds us that for all the anxieties, this period of enforced inactivity was for grownups of a certain age and financial security not entirely unpleasant – a reminder of the endless, aimless summer days of childhood, an Edenic existence outside time which workaholic media professionals thought never to see again. A kind of miracle.Vincent Macaigne plays dishevelled film-maker Paul (very different, surely, from the stylish Assayas), who has come back to the handsome family home of his late parents, staying there with his girlfriend (Nine d’Urso) and communicating with his ex-wife and adored tween daughter on Zoom. He is going to be living there with his brother Etienne (Micha Lescot) a music journalist and his new partner (Nora Hamzawi). Assayas uses what appears to be his actual home and in his opening autobiographical voiceover introduces us to the house and grounds - easily the best part of the film, actually - and in further personal sections dispenses with the fiction and talks about the “Assayas” family.Etienne is in a position to record radio programmes at home and gets started on a show about music stars who have died of Covid, starting with Dave Greenfield of the Stranglers. (For a second, I was hoping Assayas would break out some choice Stranglers tracks, with Etienne playing air guitar. But sadly no.) Paul has little to do but mooch about the place, musing on ideas for films. Paul’s obsessive anti-Covid cleanliness soon irritates Etienne who annoys Paul with his cooking. But of course there are meals and laughter too.Nothing illustrates the difference between French and British cinema more than this film. Which Brit director would be allowed to indulge himself or herself with this civilised, cultured musing? And to assume that of course there is a supportive home-turf audience for it? This is a film in which someone sits down and listens to a podcast with Jean Renoir talking about his father Pierre-Auguste Renoir – and it’s really interesting. Well, I’m glad that Assayas is allowed to do it. Hors du Temps (Suspended Time) screened at the Berlin film festival. This article was amended on 19 February 2024 to correct the names of the two principal characters."
"Viktoria review – fierce, urgent intergenerational story from communist-bloc Bulgaria ",A young woman plots her escape from behind the Iron Curtain until a baby ruins her plans in this 2014 debut from Maya Vitkova,4,"Maya Vitkova’s eloquent, ambitious, emotionally committed drama Viktoria premiered at Sundance 10 years ago and more than deserves its UK streaming release now. This excellent film would be a striking accomplishment from anyone – and this was actually Vitkova’s debut. It feels fierce and urgent: tremendously designed, acted and shot. Viktoria is an intergenerational women’s story from Bulgaria both before and after the 1989 revolutions, a film that maybe in its absurdism, scepticism and slow-burn passion shows the influences of Romanian director Radu Jude, with whom Vitkova worked on short films. On TV, Vitkova produced an episode of Michael Palin’s BBC TV New Europe travel series, heading across the Balkans; Viktoria, interestingly, has an image of someone walking across the snow, only to be flicked over by a giant hand from the sky.In Sofia, Bulgaria, in the low-morale 70s, a young woman called Boryana (Irmena Chichikova) is plotting her escape from the dreary Eastern bloc with her doctor husband Ivan (Dimo Dimov); she dreams of the US and has a cigarette lighter in the shape of the Statue of Liberty. Her disloyal views are very much not shared by her glowering mother Dima (Mariana Krumova) who is a diehard communist and cannot conceive of any existence other than submission to the (male) party power structure. When Boryana gets pregnant, she is horrified, and does everything she can to abort the child; she does not have the milk of maternal kindness in her. Milk is to be the film’s keynote image of frustration and discontent – along with the blood of the yearned-for miscarriage.But her baby girl Viktoria – whom we first see bobbing around in the womb as an eerie red presence – is born on Bulgarian Victory day, 9 September, with no umbilical cord or belly button. The party authorities decide that that this baby is symbolic of a bold young country in a permanently revolutionary state of renewal, without the belly button of old loyalties. So Viktoria and her family get special privileges, always under officialdom’s eye, thus permanently ruining Boryana’s chances of a discreet escape. Viktoria grows up to be a pampered, brattish 10-year-old (Daria Vitkova), who is allowed to inspect the belly buttons of fellow pupils at her special school and use a special hotline to phone her adoring godfather, the prime minister. As for Boryana, she is in a catatonic state of resentment: she smiles just once, 50 minutes into the movie, when she thinks she might be about to escape.Then the Berlin Wall falls, and grandmother, mother and daughter are orphaned by the times; the umbilical cord that linked them to their various emotional certainties has vanished. Dima relapses into shock, not unlike her daughter’s silent resentment; Boryana is unsure what to make of the new freedom at home which she has spent her life assuming could only exist abroad. Young Viktoria grows to be a teenager (now played by Kalina Vitkova); all her princessy entitlement has been confiscated but she achieves a new kind of maturity in a closer relationship with her grandmother.The power of Viktoria is in the tragedy of an unused life, unused passion, unfulfilled potential and unrealised existence. For Boryana and her generation, 1989 and the end of communism was a seismic but uninterpretable event; they were not old enough (like Dima) to have known the security of the old communist ways, nor young enough (like Viktoria) fully to enjoy the new freedoms. The film shows that after the Soviet collapse, there is something strange, drifting, almost anticlimactic. Hideous though postwar communism was, it was in some ways a great period, replete with drama and purpose and meaning; now that has gone, and they are left with a blankness, as blank as Viktoria’s belly button-free stomach. There is a sense of loss but of something else too: the possibility of reinvention and a historical slate wiped clean.Viktoria is released on 15 February on Klassiki."
Finding Her Beat review – women-only taiko drumming troupe takes on the US,"The challenges of bringing the Japanese drum style to an American audience are laboriously told, but the performance scenes are thrilling",2,"This performance-driven documentary tracks the lengths to which organisers and players went in February 2020 to put together a show featuring mostly female taiko drummers from both Asia and the US. (Taiko are Japanese barrel-shaped drums that come in a range of sizes, from roughly bucket-sized to airplane-engine sized.) Taiko also refers to a whole style of performance that has grown up around ensembles playing together in overlapping or contrapuntal rhythm patterns, sometimes supplemented with singers, dancers and other traditional Japanese instruments. Professional taiko performers are traditionally men – who perform in relatively little clothing because it’s fierce, sweaty work but perhaps also so that viewers can admire the players’ muscular physiques. Like many traditional Japanese performance styles, women were excluded from it until recently and, inspired by touring companies of taiko drummers, it has taken off in the US, not just among Japanese expats but among wider Asian-American communities.Enter Jennifer Weir, the CEO of TaikoArts Midwest, who is one of the film’s producers and a woman of Korean lineage who was adopted by Americans. Weir and her wife Megan Chao-Smith, who is also a drummer, conceive a plan to put on a showcase featuring some of the best female taiko players they can rustle up, including luminaries such as Chieko Kojima and Kaoly Asano from Japan as well as Sacramento-born Tiffany Tamaribuchi. The film basically tracks them through the ups and downs of bringing the company together, rehearsing despite language difficulties, finding a venue that can accommodate their numbers and putting on a show that acquires the name HERbeat.Once the music finally kicks in, which in the last act is shown in satisfyingly hefty chunks, the magic starts. All the other let’s-put-on-a-show shenanigans that lead up that – which includes endless shots of people looking stressed and having intense conversations over, say, should they have a few men in the show or keep it women only – is frankly a bit boring. Directors Dawn Mikkelson and Keri Pickett are not necessarily into asking probing questions, which means some of it feels a little hagiographic. It would have been interesting to learn a bit more about taiko from a musician’s point of view: how do they score the pieces, how does choreography fit into it and so on. Presumably, it would have been harder to sell a documentary that just showed the HERbeat performance in its entirety, but personally that’s what I would have rather watched instead. Finding Her Beat is released on 14 February on digital platforms."
Head Count review – Burghart brothers’ tricksy crime drama has certain flair ,"With tough guys pointing his own gun at his head, Aaron Jakubenko’s arithmetically minded Kat counts back how many times it has gone off to work out if there are any bullets left",3,"This suspenseful comedy-drama gets a little tricksy, with flashbacks within flashbacks and sudden shifts of tone. But the lead actor Aaron Jakubenko (yet another Australian alumnus of the soap Neighbours, nailing the Kansas accent here) has plenty of charisma – enough to pull the viewer along for the rocky ride mapped out by the writing-directing sibling team, Ben and Jacob Burghart. The Burghart brothers originally made a short version of the set up here, also called Head Count, which might explain the film’s bitty quality, but as aspiring film-makers they have a certain flair.As the film opens, Jakubenko’s protagonist Kat finds himself in the hands of some ominous-looking tough guys who are holding Kat’s own revolver to his head. An arithmetically minded fellow (we later see him getting busted at a casino for counting cards), Kat starts thinking back intensely to all the times the gun has gone off in the last few days in order to determine if there are any bullets left. Cue the tangled string of flashbacks spanning several years to show how he got into this mess, starting with only a few days earlier when Kat was a prisoner of the Kansas Department of Corrections, working on a chain gang. A fellow prisoner further down the chain begged to be allowed to relieve himself in some nearby bushes but became the first of several to be attacked by a pack of cougars. In the confusion, Kat escaped, albeit with a manacle still on his leg. After this absurdist, black comedy opener what follows is a series of farcical events sprinkled with the threat of violence, dosed out in regular intervals.Various supporting characters weave in and out of the story, including Kat’s brother Hayes (Kyle Dyck) and barkeeper Jo (Melanie Zanetti), for whom Kat holds something of a torch. The Burgharts and their editor, Edward Schroer, use rhyming match-on-edits to create structure, for instance where the empty chambers of a gun echo a wheel of poker chips, or a hand is seen in the same position in two different adjacent shots. That sort of thoughtful level of craft is impressively maintained throughout, from the lighting to the score.Head Count is released on 19 February on digital platforms"
Shreya Ghoshal review – masterful Indian singer has a voice like billowing silk,"Wembley Arena, London The Bollywood legend says she wants to manifest a homely feeling, and – despite a 12,000-strong crowd – she does so with quips, warmth and a richly varied setlist",4,"Tipsy uncles swaying their arms, adverts for a local cash and carry, a child dozing on her mum’s lap: sold-out arena shows rarely feel intimate, but in Wembley, a masterful Shreya Ghoshal induces communal revelry.Ghoshal is one of India’s most successful contemporary playback singers (the vocalists dubbed over actors in film musicals). Emerging in 2000, then the 16-year-old winner of a TV talent show, her transfixing voice – capable of being sweet and delicate as well as altogether more formidable – has become a dominant presence across the country’s film industry, and she now has 29 million Instagram followers.Tonight, she glides around the stage amid pyrotechnics and some surreal backdrops (an incongruous snow globe, for example). Smiling coyly, she quips in Hindi, rousing people to clap and sing along, but also to laugh – as when she tries wearing sunglasses with her glamorous sari ensemble for some “swag”. And then there’s that voice. It cuts through the air like billowing silk, matched in weightlessness by the bansuri in her nine-person band. “Wow … just wow”, someone mutters a few seats away following a sublime rendition of O Saathi Re that crescendos into a blazing quasi-rock number.Accompanied ably by male vocalist Kinjal Chatterjee, Ghoshal’s setlist is relentless, performing her classics (Barso Re, in tribute to London’s near-constant state of “monsoon”, gets a particularly enthused reception) as well as newer hits such as Ve Kamleya. She pays homage to greats including Mohammad Rafi, Lata Mangeshkar and Asha Bhosle with an arresting covers medley, before sitting behind the grand piano, playing as the audience tenderly sing ghazals with her.This warmth seems remarkable given the scale of the setting, but Ghoshal says she wants to manifest the homely feeling she used to get at family music gatherings. So while a 20-minute break for people to use the toilets feels jarring to the momentum, it adds to the sense that she wants everyone to enjoy this.By the end of the show, when she’s into glorious Bollywood showstoppers such as Ooh La La and Radha, people are running from their seats to get as close to the stage as they can, dancing with contagious abandon. Ghoshal beams down; it’s been a delight."
Suncoast review – Laura Linney helps lift adequate family saga,The Oscar nominee does her brittle shtick well enough as a mother caring for her dying son in a so-so comedy drama,3,"Premiering at Sundance 2024 yet assembled as if it were primed for the festival two or three decades earlier, Suncoast is the kind of broad, sunny Searchlight crowd-pleaser that aims to make up for its lack of originality with an abundance of heavily shoveled charm. It’s a strategy that just about works when the stakes are low and soapy but films in this subgenre ultimately demand a full-on assault to the heartstrings and the first-time writer-director Laura Chinn can’t quite muster enough genuine emotion to get us there, her so-so debut working best when investment is at its lowest.It’s a busy patchwork of dynamics we loosely know from Searchlight indies all too well. There’s the coming-of-age narrative of a girl named Doris (played by Thandiwe Newton’s daughter Nico Parker) who is pushing herself out of the shadows at school to become more seen, making friends with the girls who had previously ignored her and flirting with the guy she’d never thought herself good enough for. There’s the family drama that sees her clash with a difficult mother (played by Laura Linney) who spends her time caring for a non-communicative son dying of cancer, letting their relationship suffer in the process. Then there’s the most superfluous element as Doris strikes an unlikely friendship with an eccentric grieving husband (Woody Harrelson) protesting outside the hospice where her brother is being cared for.Loosely based on Chinn’s experiences as a teen growing up in the mid-00s, Suncoast feels influenced less by what it was really like in 2005 and more by the kinds of earnestly made dramedies that were being released at the time. Linney is incapable of a truly bad performance and watching her do her brittle, one rant away from having a heart attack shtick is forever watchable but it’s hard to fully buy her as a working-class Floridian waiting tables, never not seeming like she’s a lost Upper East Sider. Parker is a charming young actor but she’s similarly too refined to sell girl from the wrong side of the tracks who no one has noticed at school. The pair do a decent amount of lifting, Linney especially, but we’re never immersed enough in their world to believe them as anything but actors doing a bit, adding another level of artifice to something that is in need of more reality. Harrelson is in full sleepwalk mode, grouching and quipping like he could be in any one of his films from the last 20 years, and it’s not really his fault, his very inclusion never making any narrative sense other than to help pad out a slight story with a sellable name.None of the threads are able to poke themselves out of the murk of familiarity enough to truly pierce (the high school drama is too unspecific to do anything but amble along) but it’s the mother-daughter conflict that almost gets there. Linney’s struggle – knowing your child is slowly dying and being unable to let that thought not utterly consume and destroy you – is often played a little too cartoonishly but it’s also affecting and difficult in moments, as the long march of pre-grief transforms a person into someone who can be unpleasant to be around. It’s this knottier character that ends up feeling the most authentic in a film that can struggle with authenticity.Never quite landing with enough of an impact for it to stick around in our heads after the sun has gone in, Suncoast settles for amiable competency.Suncoast is available on Hulu in the US and Disney+ in the UK on 9 February"
Force of Nature: The Dry 2 review – Eric Bana returns as Aaron Falk in solid thriller,"Based on Jane Harper’s bestseller, this twisty mystery follows Falk as he investigates a dodgy CEO (Richard Roxburgh) and his missing employee (Anna Torv)",3,"The first and perhaps most obvious point to make about Robert Connolly’s sequel to his popular and finely made mystery-thriller The Dry is that it’s not dry at all – it’s very, very wet. The director, again adapting a bestselling novel by Jane Harper, opens with shots of lush wilderness – the film is largely based in the Victorian mountain ranges – and rain-covered leaves.The first time we see Eric Bana, back again as federal police agent Aaron Falk, he’s doing laps in a swimming pool. His fellow agent, Carmen Cooper (Jacqueline McKenzie), is anxious to solve their latest case – a missing person’s investigation – as flooding might soon hit the region. It is police informant Alice (The Newsreader’s Anna Torv), who is alone, lost and in deep trouble, particularly when the storm hits.This film drips with pot boiler-ish twists and turns, and is saturated with genre machinations – engaged, like many mystery scripts, in surprising and one-upping the viewer. But developments in the last act especially – and there are no spoilers here – contain some tough pills to swallow, including a resolution to a key plot thread that made me think: “Well, that was rather easy.”Nevertheless, there’s quite a bit to appreciate in Force of Nature: The Dry 2, including an elevated tone, strong performances and handsome photography of Victorian landscapes, having been filmed in locations including the Yarra Valley, Otways and Dandenong Ranges.Part of the mystery involves determining just what kind of mystery we’re watching. We know it involves a hiking trip gone horribly wrong, everybody returning except for Alice. The expedition was a team-building exercise organised by Bailey Tenants, a corporation headed by CEO Daniel Bailey, played by Richard Roxburgh. (Not dissimilar here, in his slickness and slipperiness, to his performance in Prosper.)Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningHere’s where things get a bit tangled: Falk and Cooper have been investigating Bailey, and Alice is their whistleblowing informant. Her disappearance may be related to this – or maybe it has something to do with her being an unpleasant person to work with, which is painfully obvious to the rest of her hiking team: Lauren (Robin McLeavy), Bree (Lucy Ansell), Beth (Sisi Stringer) and Daniel’s wife, Jill (Deborra-Lee Furness).Falk is, naturally, a bit suss on the whole situation, sniffing around for information about anything potentially sinister and soon ascertaining that Alice, Daniel and Jill had an argument. “After that everything changed,” says one character, in a line that feels befitting of – or even engineered for – the trailer. As does a similar, subsequent line commenting on how one small decision “can change everything”. It’s moments like these, accompanied by an aggressively used score, where Force of Nature feels like it is nudging towards heavy-headedness.Sign up to Saved for LaterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsafter newsletter promotionWhat does feel totally germane to this world is Bana’s carefully withdrawn performance as Falk, again featuring lots of sombre expressions. The rest of the cast are solid too, including a tetchy and bullish Torv, capturing a different and more varied shade of whistleblower than the usual morally driven informant.Like in the first, non-wet The Dry, Connolly jumps back in time, deploying with co-editors Alexandre de Franceschi and Maria Papoutsis a more circular rhythm this time around. One key strand teases out what happened on the hike, the past bleeding into the present, while another – visually differentiated by a grainy-looking filter – returns to Falk’s youth. His history was a big part of The Dry, his investigations into the death of an old friend from his home town drawing to the surface terrible memories and dormant emotions around the unsolved death of a teenage girlfriend.Both films double down on the “This Time It’s Personal” trope, which, second time around, feels a tad forced. Does every case this guy works on involve skeletons in his closet? Fidelity to the source material comes into play, of course, complicated by differences between mediums: what feels totally ordinary on page can come across as something else on screen. Harper has written a third and final book in the series, which I hope Connolly will also adapt into a film – with Force of Nature, he has done a decent job in keeping us engaged in Falk’s world.Force of Nature: The Dry 2 is in Australian cinemas from Thursday"
Slotherhouse review – sorority-house slasher brings homicidal sloth to mean girls ,A killing machine sloth named Alpha gets her claws out on a group of sorority sisters in this silly – and sadly unfunny – comedy-horror,2,"As another academic year begins, the sisters at university sorority Sigma Lambda Theta are all a-flutter over rush week (whatever that is) and the election for this year’s sorority president; this is expected to be top mean girl Brianna (Sydney Craven) for the third year in a row. However Emily (Lisa Ambalavanar) longs to be popular too in this world where esteem is measured in social media likes and followers. Reasoning that people love interesting pets, she decides to adopt a three-toed sloth from a dodgy exotic animal importer (Stefan Kapicic) and bring it back to the sorority house. Unfortunately, no one realises until too late that the sloth, whom Emily and the others named Alpha, is a homicidal killing machine who doesn’t move all that slowly when she’s on a mission to slash with those gnarly knitting-needle-long claws. What’s more, Alpha can also drive, use a computer, and take her own selfies. OMG!As the above might suggest, the very premise of this film is fantastically daft – so silly that one can only imagine that director Matthew Goodhue and writers Bradley Fowler and Cady Lanigan cooked up the idea while bingeing lord knows what infernal substance. Perhaps someone dared them to make a horror film with the most unlikely species they could think of, and after dismissing platypuses (already used in Phineas and Ferb), echidnas (Sonic the Hedgehog), and dwarf lemurs (Madagascar), they settled on sloths.But beyond that one joke set-up and the title itself, Slotherhouse is sadly not that funny, even accounting for the fact that it has such a soft target in the American campus “Greek” system. A few more script drafts might have helped sharpen this into something a little more bitingly satirical, comparable to, say Black Sheep, a cracking little New Zealand comedy-horror film about mutant sheep from quite a few years back. Budget must have been tight, which is why the film is shot mostly in two or three locations in Serbia, and all the American sorority sisters are played by British actors. They, at least, deserve some credit – especially Ambalavanar, EastEnders veteran Craven and Bianca Beckles-Rose who gets to be the comic relief butch among the femmes – for screaming with such commitment and managing to keep a straight face throughout. Slotherhouse is released on 12 February on digital platforms."
Your Fat Friend review – fat activist Aubrey Gordon takes on the cruelty of Big Diet ,A frank but endearing documentary makes for a convincing indictment of the corporate machine that says big is bad,3,"Film-maker Jeanie Finlay paints a warm and generous portrait of a sympathetic subject: the American fat activist, podcaster and bestselling author Aubrey Gordon who became a viral sensation for her blog Your Fat Friend, in which she railed against the cruelty – sometimes unintentional and sometimes not – of people who can’t help deriding people like her. Her sprightly, witty, unrepentant arias of complaint earned her a fanbase that included Roxane Gay, James Corden and Adele. But it also got her trolling and vicious abuse.Gordon tells us of a lifetime enduring cringe-making euphemisms and condescension, as well as taking on the insidious diet industry, which has now rebranded itself the “wellness” industry; she makes a fierce and persuasive case that the diet/wellness racket is a corporate machine that promotes anxieties and self-hate among women and then converts that into money. She compares big diet to big tobacco – a boldly dissentient analysis, in fact, given that the cigarette comparison is what many reach for in talking about the processed food industry.The film also talks to Gordon’s parents and, with delicacy and tact, indicates that her mother’s decision to take Gordon to a junior diet class when she was in her early teens did no good at all and may simply have created an unhappiness that contributed to an eating disorder. It also might have been a factor in her parents’ divorce, and again Finlay subtly lets the audience see what might have happened here. Gordon’s dad is a retired pilot – ironic, considering how awful fat people are made to feel on planes – and he remarried a flight attendant (or “stewardess” as they were known in those days) who was very much part of the male-pleasing body-shape template. Interestingly, perhaps even slyly, Finlay edits her film so that we hear Gordon complain how the phrase “you have great skin” is a classic avoidant euphemism – and then we hear her stepmother sweetly say that exact thing. As for issues around relationships, they are not discussed at all. Perhaps a flaw.Fundamentally, Gordon’s position appears to be that there are some people whose physiology and metabolism are such that they will always be fat, like it or not, and that any struggle on their part to contain it would mean a zombie-like obsession which would obliterate every other aspect of their waking lives. In brief: it isn’t worth it and, as Keynes might have said in this context, in the long run we are all dead, so deal with it. Let fat people be fat and stop victimising them.In a way, this is a libertarian argument that runs against arguments from left and right, saying in the effect that this whole issue is an American first world symptom of prosperity. But the issue of the alleged insensitivity of doctors who raise concerns about heart disease and diabetes could have been addressed more rigorously. Well, the humour and generosity of Gordon shine through. Your Fat Friend is released on 9 February in UK and Irish cinemas"
Days of Heaven review – Malick’s early masterwork heralds a rarefied visionary,The director’s rereleased 1978 film revealed some of the authorial signatures that would underscore a film-making career punctuated by a two-decade disappearance ,5,"Terrence Malick’s richly achieved early film from 1978 is now rereleased; it is a tragic romance and slo-mo melodrama which appeared five years after his debut, and after which Malick mysteriously vanished from public view until The Thin Red Line came out fully 21 years later to banish his Salingerian reclusive reputation. Days of Heaven reintroduced to movie audiences his passionate sense of landscape, his unhurried tempo and mastery of calm, although this is in fact an eventful and dramatic film. It also established his compositional technique which foregrounds the shifts and eddies of mood; it is partly a function of shooting a great deal, shaping the movie in the edit and cutting a lot out. In years and decades to come, many of his actors would be disconcerted to discover at their movie premiere that their parts had been radically slimmed or junked entirely. And perhaps most importantly, Days of Heaven established Malick’s most recognisable authorial signature: his reverence for the fading, deepening sunlight of dusk which made him virtually the high priest of the “golden hour”.It is set in 1916, with some of the US feverishly excited about the fortunes still to be made in the vast swathes of still unexploited farmland and also aware of the looming inevitability of getting involved in the European war. Three drifters from Chicago arrive in the Texas panhandle in the north of the state, hoping to get seasonal farm labouring work. Abby (Brooke Adams), is a beautiful, quiet young woman with a kid sister Linda (Linda Manz), an annoying, entertaining chatterbox who is also watchful and slightly scared by how vulnerable they are; she is the film’s deadpan narrator, coolly accepting their hardship and survival stratagems. With them is Abby’s lover, the brooding and hot-tempered Bill (Richard Gere), who has fled the city after killing a factory foreman and is now posing as Abby’s brother.The trio fetch up on a giant estate owned by one of the state’s richest men, a melancholy and refined figure played by Sam Shepard; he notices Abby and takes a diffident, gentlemanly shine to her. Cunning Bill has overheard the man’s doctor telling him he has only a year to live and so encourages Abby to seduce him into marriage, which will make them rich after his imminent death. But to his horror, the Faustian bargain doesn’t pay off: the farmer is revitalised, even cured, by married love, and for her part Abby can see how she could flower with this cultured man and not the brutish Bill, who is tormented by jealousy. And perhaps the Old Testament God that rules over Texas will send a biblical plague to punish this transgression.Malick drew on classic sources to make his own classic: John Steinbeck’s The Grapes of Wrath (with Thomas Hardy at one remove, perhaps) and Andrew Wyeth’s painting Christina’s World. I noticed the resemblance to another American master: Henry James. And, of course, Bill and Abby’s final ordeal has something of Bonnie and Clyde and Butch and Sundance.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotionMalick shows us the abyss of subtle iniquity in the situation that Bill has created for himself. Shepard’s farmer good-naturedly invites Bill and Linda to come live with him and his new wife; he and Abby enjoy their conjugal intimacy, which Abby doesn’t seem to mind too much, but Bill finds that his cynicism and greed have not cushioned him against his agony. And the strange thing about Days of Heaven is that for all their intimacy, Bill and Abby are really like a brother and sister; their imposture, their poverty, their utter dependence on fate and capitalist market forces has infantilised them both. The grownup love relationship, however doomed and founded on deceit it is, is that which Abby has with the innocent farmer. All this is set against a vast backdrop of wheatfields, whose mystery and beauty comes into focus every night as the sun goes down: a premonition of death and the disclosure of meaning which we all hope will arrive just before our lives’ end.As Malick’s film-making career continued, some of the brevity and realist clarity of Days of Heaven would be less apparent, and his work asked audiences to breathe the thinner and more rarefied air of the visionary. But this movie showed his artistry and purpose from the very early days. Days of Heaven is released on 2 February in UK and Irish cinemas, and is available on digital platforms in Australia."
Argylle review – unbearably self-satisfied smirk of a spy caper from Matthew Vaughn,"What could have been a fun movie is instead self-admiring with a dull meta-narrative, phoned-in cameos and an awful lead performance",1,"The rectangle of the screen itself seems to bend and twist into a giant self-satisfied smirk for this unbearably smug caper from director Matthew Vaughn. It has all the interest of a men’s magazine cover-shoot: thin, flimsy, lumbered with a dull meta-narrative and dodgy acting, and boasting a blank parade of phoned-in cameos from the supporting cast. Argylle is a high-concept elevator pitch stuck between floors, a piece of colourful would-be franchise content that Vaughn is tiresomely trying to fold into the extended universe of his other work.I have in the past enjoyed this director’s raucous bad taste, and it’s not true to say that he can only direct macho guys because he got such great stuff from Chloë Grace Moretz in his superhero comedy Kick-Ass. But through some terrible directing anti-alchemy, he has elicited an awful lead performance here from Bryce Dallas Howard as spy novelist Elly Conway, whose creations uncannily mirror real life. She looks waxy, inert and uncomfortable; it’s as if she is wearing cut-glass contact lenses, with a torpid, unfocused quality which the script’s big twist does not explain or excuse. Vaughn and screenwriter Jason Fuchs never give this writer any funny or interesting lines or find a satisfying way to let her character in on the unwieldy joke and bring out her supposed dual quality as action heroine – although it was, admittedly, ingenious of Vaughn and Fuchs to bring out a novelisation of the film this month supposedly written by “Elly Conway” herself.We are shown a super spy called Argylle, a dapper, jaunty Brit stolidly played by Henry Cavill with a silly square haircut and some sort of goofy velveteen jacket, in a safe pair of manicured hands performance. He confronts LaGrange, a slinky femme-fatale killer played by Dua Lipa, and teams up with his comrades Wyatt (John Cena) and Keira (Ariana DeBose). But we are also shown the more down to earth life of Conway, a bestselling spy writer, taking adoring questions from her fanbase at sold-out bookstore readings, putting the finishing touches to the latest novel in her “Argylle” series and testily taking notes about the ending in a Zoom call with her adoring mother, Ruth, played by Catherine O’Hara.But just as she is making a train journey to see her mom, a wild-haired grinning guy called Aidan (Sam Rockwell) plonks down in the empty seat opposite. He professes himself to be her biggest fan, explaining that he is a professional spy and that a number of important and scary people in his world are taking an interest in the extraordinary way she is able to predict exactly what they are getting up to. These people include a certain Mr Ritter (Bryan Cranston), who runs a renegade evil-empire setup called “The Division”.This could theoretically be a fun movie, but it is all so self-conscious and self-admiring, with key action sequences rendered null and void by being played on two levels, the imaginary and the real, so cancelling each other out. The thought of Argylle 2 and Argylle 3 is very dispiriting. The books might do better. Argylle is released on 1 February in Australia and on 2 February in the UK and the US."
Migration review – zany ducks-in-the-city adventure from White Lotus’ Mike White,"Co-scripted by White (a vegan), and superbly voiced by the likes of Awkwafina and David Mitchell, this family comedy about migrating ducks is a fun ride with clipped wings",3,"You could do worse at half-term than this new family animation from Illumination (the studio behind Sing and Minions). It’s a zany caper about a family of mallards; it’s not particularly original, with ideas and laughs that feel a little dusty, like they’ve been cobbled from bits and bobs knocking around the studio. But there are enough high jinks – as well as a seriously cute duckling – to keep it on the flight path.In New England, a daddy duck called Mack (voiced by Kumail Nanjiani) is risk-averse and overprotective of his two kids: teenager Dax (Caspar Jennings) and that adorable duckling, Gwen (Tresi Gazal). Somehow, the kids twist Mack’s wing into migrating south for the first time, and what follows is a series of scrapes as the family fly to Jamaica. After a wrong turn they crash-land in New York, where the animators go to town on a gaggle of realistic-looking pigeons whose aggro leader has an unsightly rotted-off foot and is brilliantly voiced by Awkwafina with a Noo Yoik hoodlum accent.The script is co-written by Mike White, creator of The White Lotus; White is vegan, apparently, so naturally much of the jeopardy revolves around the ducks being at risk of ending up on someone’s plate. There’s a disappointingly bland personality-lite non-speaking villain called Chef, owner of a Manhattan restaurant, who looks creepily like Bono beefed up to the size of the Rock, with a goatee and tiny tinted glasses. More fun is the duck farm run by two boomer hippies, where the duck in charge is a shaman dude voiced by Peep Show’s David Mitchell.All of which make for a perfectly acceptable family animation. But Migration does feels like B-team Illumination, and time will tell if it has any franchise potential. I can’t imagine kids watching this nine times over like Sing. That said, my two seven-year-old cinema buddies giggled themselves senseless on the bus home repeating a line about the mallards getting turned into duck a l’orange. So what do I know? Migration is released on 2 February in UK and Irish cinemas"
"American Fiction review – entertaining comedy collision of race, class and envy","This enjoyable meta-level adaptation of Percival Everett’s 2001 novel Erasure tackles black-victimhood stereotypes, showcasing Jeffrey Wright and Issa Rae as rival writers",4,"Thelonious “Monk” Ellison is a middle-aged black humanities professor in Los Angeles, roundly disliked by students and faculty colleagues, who is the author of many intellectually demanding and commercially disastrous novels based on classical myth. Depressed by his career and by money worries – including an elderly mother needing residential care for dementia – Monk is finally triggered by the bestselling triumph of a new novel by black author Sintara Golden, entitled We’s Lives in da Ghetto, which apparently panders to all the illiterate black-victimhood cliches beloved of white cultural gatekeepers. Enraged, Monk writes a spoof hood-violence novel, My Pafology, by the supposed convicted felon Stagg R Leigh, and sends it to his agent, assuming the obvious crassness will signal its satirical intent. But then … well, those acquainted with the Broadway career of Max Bialystock and Leo Bloom might guess what happens next.American Fiction is the highly entertaining new literary comedy from film-maker Cord Jefferson, a TV writer making his feature directing debut with his own emollient adaptation of the metafictional masterpiece Erasure by Percival Everett, published in 2001. Jeffrey Wright is an excellent Monk: sensitive, morose, prickly and idealistic in a gloomily self-harming way. Tracee Ross Ellis is his shrewd physician sister Lisa; Sterling K Brown is his cosmetic surgeon brother Cliff, who has just come out as gay; Leslie Uggams is affectingly dignified as Monk’s mother Agnes; Issa Rae is Monk’s nemesis, Sintara Golden. It all works very enjoyably, despite Jefferson sugaring the original a little, including changing the specific kind of medical practice that Lisa has.American Fiction succeeds in spite of arguably flunking a particular challenge, faced up to more candidly by Michael Winterbottom and Frank Cottrell-Boyce with their adaptation of Laurence Sterne’s Tristram Shandy in A Cock and Bull Story from 2006, or Harold Pinter with his screenplay version of John Fowles’s The French Lieutenant’s Woman in 1981, adaptations which explicitly attempted to reproduce in realist movie terms the originals’ meta-levels of narrative. This is because the midsection of Everett’s original novel includes the text of My Pafology in its entirety; it is long enough for readers to immerse themselves in it, to register how absurd and exaggerated it is but also see its thrilling gusto and energy and maybe even, who knows, wonder if the author perhaps toyed with the idea of attempting a bestseller like this himself but settled for presenting it in quotation marks.So in transposing this to film, Jefferson must surely have pondered the possibility of making his Monk a highbrow film studies professor whose My Pafology is not a novel but a screenplay for something like New Jack City (which is referenced here). Well, Jefferson engages with these ideas at the end, and it is an amusing and absorbing fantasy of how class and race and literary taste collide, and a parable of career defeat ironically redeemed by society’s hypocrisy and absurdity. It is also a mordant study of literary envy: Monk’s angry imitation of We’s Lives in da Ghetto reminded me a little of Kingsley Amis’s description in his memoirs of being rattled by the superior success of a despised rival, and his fleeting fear that he should simply swallow his pride and imitate this person’s style.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotionAt one point Jefferson invents a confrontation between Monk and Sintara in which Sintara stands up for her novel, and this is perhaps a loss of satirical nerve (the author’s name is incidentally more obviously parodic in the book). Wright and Rae play the scene with conviction, however, and make us see a kind of snobbery in Monk’s reaction to her success, and maybe something gendered too. Then there is something a bit farcical when Monk has to pose in public as the slouching imaginary badass Stagg R Leigh – but perhaps no more farcical than the real-life case of the author Laura Albert, exposed in 2006 for inventing phoney abuse survivor JT LeRoy, who had written thrillingly authentic fictions about her supposedly troubled life, and got her sister-in-law to put on a wig and sunglasses to be this reclusive literary genius. (Erasure in fact predates this case.)Broad-brush American Fiction might be, but its approach to race and racism is oblique and unexpected, and it’s very funny about publishing’s literary ghetto. American Fiction is released on 2 February in UK and Irish cinemas, and will be streaming on Prime Video in Australia from 27 February."
The Color Purple review – off-note musical take on Alice Walker’s novel,"Director Blitz Bazawule turns the Pulitzer prize-winning saga of rape and racism into a nostalgic, tonally jarring song and dance spectacle",2,"There are certain stories that seem to be fundamentally ill-suited for reinvention as a musical, and Alice Walker’s The Color Purple, with its themes of incestuous rape, spousal abuse, racism, inequality and poverty, is arguably one such story. And yet here we are. After the multi-Oscar-nominated 1985 adaptation directed by Steven Spielberg and a Broadway musical version, Walker’s epic novel returns to the big screen, in this incarnation a tonally jarring song and dance spectacle, directed by Blitz Bazawule (co-director of Beyoncé’s Black Is King).This decades-spanning story of an embattled Black woman’s struggle to find her inner strength has lost none of its ability to shock. When we first meet Celie (played by Phylicia Pearl Mpasi as a child and the impressive Fantasia Barrino as an adult), she is a 14-year-old, heavily pregnant for the second time by her monstrous bully of a father (Deon Cole), a father who later barters her into marriage to the violently abusive and serially unfaithful Mister (Colman Domingo). Mister breaks his wife’s spirit and denies her contact with her beloved sister Nettie (played by Halle Bailey as a child). Meanwhile, spirited Sofia (Danielle Brooks), the sometime wife of Mister’s son, is imprisoned for six years for punching a white man.It’s a punishingly bleak story, and the songs, with their antiseptic polished sheen, seem fundamentally out of tune with the unforgiving grit of the plot. Likewise, the look of the film: there’s a gauzy, honey-dipped nostalgic glow to the photography that romanticises Celie’s grim existence, softening the hard edges and prettifying the misery. While I love a life-affirming tale of redemption as much as the next person, there’s something synthetic and disingenuous about this one."
The Underdoggs review – Snoop Dogg turns kids’ team coach in wholesome sports comedy,Snoop plays a former sports star who takes on losing pee-wee outfit in a charming comedy that has more than a passing resemblance to Bad News Bears,3,"When laconic rapper-turned-actor Snoop Dogg is called on to appear in a film, he more often than not plays himself or a version thereof – and so it goes again in this salty but ultimately very wholesome sports movie. There’s even a sly parallel between the character Snoop plays and the efforts he’s made in the real world setting up an American football league for kids. Yes, his thespian range may be pretty limited, but there’s no denying Snoop has a palpable onscreen charisma and a good sense of comic timing that director Charles Stone III skilfully directs around.The plot, as old as time – or at least as old as vintage 1976 comedy The Bad New Bears – posits Snoop as JJ, a once-feted professional football player best known for his mildly disappointing career despite early promise and lack of loyalty to anyone one team. Struggling to make a comeback as a commentator, JJ hits rock bottom when his reckless driving causes an accident and a judge he knew from the old days sentences him to 30 days of community service, picking up dog poop in a city park in Long Beach, California. There, JJ notices Cerise (Tika Sumpter), an ex-girlfriend from high school who is now a hard-working single mom trying to support her pre-pubescent son Tre (Jonigan Booth, a find) while he plays ball with a team that is, of course, bottom of the league. Before you can remember how to spell Walter Matthau, JJ has signed on to coach the team, aiming to turn these “Underdoggs” into a viral success story he can hype on his own podcast and thus parlay into better career prospects for himself.Lo and behold, the subsequent events pan out pretty much as one would expect, but there are few admirable plays that upend expectations. The young cast, given license to swear like navvies are clearly having a blast, and it’s nice to see the general sausage fest broken up with a young female character (Kyla Davila) who plays a crucial role in the team’s eventual success. Comedian Andrew Schultz is another bright spot as JJ’s nemesis, the coach for the Underdoggs’ biggest rivals. Given how different his character’s humour is, I wouldn’t be surprised if he improvised most of his material, like the bit where he gets the team to thank God for the invention of plastic helmets hard enough to give rival players brain damage. The Underdoggs is available now on Prime Video."
"Sundance film festival roundup – Kristen Stewart, Jesse Eisenberg, wild provocations and indie grit","The two stars had four films premiering between them in Utah, but the best performances came from Sebastian Stan and Saoirse Ronan, while a first-time director sold his horror film to Netflix for a cool $17m…",0,"It’s been 15 years since the sweet, shaggy slacker romcom Adventureland played at the Sundance film festival – and if that may seem a mere blink of an eye to the small but ardent cult of millennial filmgoers who took the film intensely to heart, its two stars returned earlier this month to the snowy mountains of Utah to remind everyone just how long it’s been. With four films premiering between them, actors Kristen Stewart and Jesse Eisenberg were separately the talk of this year’s festival: at the opening ceremony he presented her, at the grand old age of 33, with the festival’s career-achievement Visionary award.If it seems a bit premature to be handing gold watch prizes to Stewart, she made some sense of the award’s name by heading up the most gobsmacking vision of the Sundance lineup. The much-anticipated second feature from British writer-director Rose Glass, Love Lies Bleeding is a big, bruising, red-meat fever dream of a film, awash in the lurid 80s Americana of mullets and muscle trucks.It stars Stewart and bodybuilder turned actor Katy O’Brian as small-town loners who find love in the most hopeless of places – a beefcake gym in the New Mexico desert – and seek a violent escape from the various vile men trying to hold them down, chief among them a beetle-eating Ed Harris, rocking a repulsive Afghan hound coif. Equal parts Titane and Thelma & Louise, it’s as luridly, excitingly untamed as Glass’s debut, Saint Maud, was tightly wound, and gifts Stewart with a role where she can finally own her out-and-proud, don’t-give-a-fuck queerness.It made Stewart’s other film of the festival look rather wan by comparison: the fussily conceived AI romance Love Me pairs her with Steven Yeun as two android life forms who meet and bond several billion years into the post-human future, only to find avatars for their relationship in the excavated videos of a picture-perfect Instagram influencer couple. It’s all an unnecessarily cosmic setup for a tired critique of social media superficiality; its stars deserve better, and in Glass’s film, Stewart at least got it.Eisenberg, for his part, turned up in another of the festival’s most bizarre big swings, though quite unrecognisably so. In Sasquatch Sunset, an absurdist meditation from fraternal auteurs Nathan and David Zellner, he and Riley Keough appear in vastly hairy full-body prosthetics as members of a Bigfoot family in the idyllic wilds of California. Light on story and devoid of dialogue, it imagines the everyday Sasquatch routine with a mixture of Malickian magic-hour serenity and visceral bodily function detail.The result is unexpectedly touching for something so heavy on primate fart gags – but Eisenberg served himself better in his own directorial effort, the winningly tragicomic road movie A Real Pain, in which he and Succession’s Kieran Culkin star as estranged Jewish cousins tracing their ancestral roots on a Holocaust tour of Poland. It’s a loose premise for an emotionally cutting, mordantly funny examination of faith, family and that peculiarly American conception of sacred European heritage. As a study of Jewish identity in crisis, it made a fine Sundance double bill with director Nathan Silver’s hugely endearing farce Between the Temples, starring a wonderful Jason Schwartzman as a flailing synagogue cantor coaching a septuagenarian music teacher (Carol Kane, never kookier but also tenderly human) as she prepares for a late-life bat mitzvah.A Real Pain sold during the festival to Searchlight Pictures, Disney’s indie arm, for $10m, a notable coup at a Sundance where the deal-making side of things was quieter than usual. The biggest buy of the festival came from Netflix, which paid $17m for It’s What’s Inside – a nasty, conceptually clever horror film from first-time director Greg Jardin, which arrived with little advance hype, and for which critics were told by anxious PRs that even its very premise must remain embargoed. Yet the sale came with a simultaneous announcement that the film would be skipping cinemas and released directly to the platform. As cheerily as the festival proclaimed the virtues of the communal big-screen experience at every screening, dark signs were rife for the future of theatrical releasing.My favourite film of Sundance this year was certainly enhanced by the collective gasps of a captive, unprepared audience. Aaron Schimberg’s ingenious satire A Different Man, which will also play in competition at Berlin next month, stars a never-better Sebastian Stan as a shy, isolated New Yorker living with facial neurofibromatosis – until experimental treatment offers him a miracle cure. Yet with his new, conventionally handsome mug, he finds that he’s still the same unwanted outsider as before – a cruelty underlined when a charming Brit with his former condition (hilariously played by Adam Pearson, the facially different actor first seen in Jonathan Glazer’s Under the Skin) enters his life and proceeds to steal it bit by bit. It’s a wickedly caustic, increasingly surreal reflection on that current hot potato of onscreen representation and ableism, without a hint of sanctimony or self-importance.But the best performance of the festival, finally, came in something rather more conventional. Nora Fingscheidt’s BBC Film-produced The Outrun may seem a familiar addiction-and-recovery drama, but it’s lifted by the novel beauty of its Orkney setting, and given raw grace by a sensational Saoirse Ronan, fully graduating to adult roles as an alcoholic isolating and self-healing with volatile results. At a Sundance heavy on wild provocations, it was proof that traditional indie grit still has its rewards."
"Dìdi review – a tender, specific rendering of adolescence on the early internet",Sundance film festival: Sean Wang’s semi-autobiographical tale of an Asian American teen’s life played out online in 2008 is moving and detailed,4,"It’s easy to roll one’s eyes at nostalgia, so often is fondness for the past used to cover a lack of anything to say. The market is flush with reboots, redos, reunions and the Eras tour, content mining our natural affinity for (and thus, the bankability of) things that shaped us.What a joy, then, that this year’s Sundance film festival featured not one but several films that accomplished the rare and difficult task of employing nostalgia without feeling cheap, that pulled us backwards to sharp, smart, devastating and illuminating effect. Megan Park’s My Old Ass conjured the excitement and overwhelm of leaving home via a bittersweet, mushroom-induced meeting between an 18-year-old girl and her 39-year-old self. Jane Schoenbrun’s buzzy, word-of-mouth hit I Saw the TV Glow resurrected the thrill of analog TV fandom via its own Buffy the Vampire Slayer-esque TV show, for a haunting tale of obsession, identity and fandom. Both film-makers understood that when done well, there are few things more powerful in art than our feelings around the passage of time.So too in Dìdi, Sean Wang’s semi-autobiographical portrait of an Asian American boy in 2008 that is easily one of the best, most seamless films I’ve seen on the experience of growing up online. Dìdi has a clear antecedent in fellow Sundance alum Eighth Grade, Bo Burnham’s 2018 film about a girl’s phone-inflected adolescence that is still the gold standard for affecting films about the internet. The tones are strikingly similar – understated and natural, sweet and bitingly sour, observing the ordinary thrills and horrors of growing up. Both braid the digital lives of their protagonists with striking accuracy – Facebook photo albums and comments, Snapchat stories and Instagram faces, overlaid with longing, loneliness and occasional fun.Dìdi is the childhood nickname for Chris Wang (Izaac Wang), a Taiwanese American kid in Fremont, California, stranded in between middle and high school. He’s adrift in his family – his mostly absent father is away on business in Taiwan; his strained mother (Joan Chen) stuck in a thankless role as stay-at-home mom and caretaker to her judgmental mother-in-law (Chang Li Hua). His sharp-tongued sister, Vivian (Shirley Chen), weeks away from her freshman year of college at UCSD, is four years apart but a world away in his understanding.Chris is a very familiar type of lost between friends, crushes and embarrassments, hampered by a nascent sense of shame at his own difference. His eighth-grade friends believably communicate via janky YouTube videos, slang and slurs pushing the boundaries of what they can get away with. Wang is spot-on specific with the adolescent parlance of time – the casual homophobic slur, “that’s gangstaaaa (:” on a Facebook wall, plenty of jokes about race. Chris’s friends are a diverse bunch, but all make comments on his race, well-meaning or otherwise. “You’re pretty cute, for an Asian,” says his crush, Madi (Mahaela Park), in one of the film’s most quietly devastating scenes. As Chris, Izaac Wang is remarkably naturalistic and heart-piercingly vulnerable – you know that line will sting for a long, long time.Dìdi is peppered with the easy period signifiers – a Motorola Krzr flip phone, the movie Superbad, Paramore – and also the more specific, tricky details that are hard to nail but, when done with as much curiosity and research as here, mesmerizing. I’m admittedly the target age for this, having also spent the summer of 2008 languishing between middle school and high school, nervously checking AIM and pretending to like the Mandy Moore weepie A Walk to Remember to fit in. If Chris’s initial, formative years on the internet map on to yours, then the effect of Wang’s dabbling in desktop cinema is triggering, in the literal sense of memory boxes unlocking; the shock of familiarity that is the Microsoft XP pipes screensaver, Myspace top friends and “summer 08 xD” Facebook photo albums is arresting, these throwaway things that yet once consumed so much emotional energy.Dìdi has a deft handle on the era-nonspecific teenage angst and turmoil as well, enough that one needn’t to be from the class of 2012 to relate to how Chris’s world opens up, via filming videos for a group of older teens, and crumbles around feelings of shame, inadequacy and the devastation that is being left out. The costumes, setting, computer interfaces and music are all scarily accurate to 2008, a testament to Wang’s airtight hold on this particular strange, liminal period – not just between childhood and adolescence, but between early YouTube and smartphones, Myspace and social media dominance. But its tender blend of emotions is evergreen. Dìdi’s final touching, soft note of growth – so much internalized and overcome already, so much to go – would be moving in any year.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotionDìdi is showing at the Sundance film festival and is seeking distribution"
The Island review – Michael Jai White punches up in stunt-filled Caribbean action flick,The Mortal Kombat star plays an LA cop returning home to avenge his brother’s murder in this charming piece of grindhouse schlock,2,"On an unnamed island in the Caribbean, a cartel boss named Manuel (Edoardo Costa) kills bartender Akeem (Tristan Duncan) merely because he spills a drink on Nora (Cami Storm), a young singer Manuel was planning to lock up in his villa and force to sing only for himself, like a canary. The murder is not only grisly and bad management practice, but also consequential because it brings down the wrath of Akeem’s brother Mark (action movie star Michael Jai White, from Mortal Kombat and Black Dynamite), an LA policeman. It turns out Mark grew up on the island where he left behind an ex-wife, Akilah (Gillian White, who is married to her co-star Michael in real life), his mother and lots of old friends. Swearing to find out how Akeem really died, he moves back and a series of fisticuff face-offs ensue as he works through the chain of command, eventually finding his way to Manuel.Directed ploddingly by Shaun Paul Piccinino, a sometime actor himself with a background in stunts, this isn’t going to win any awards, but it has a certain charm as grindhouse schlock. Michael Jai White has a stately gravitas and he’s clearly doing most of his own stunts, which also goes for Gillian White, whose character here runs a martial arts dojo for kids. The chemistry between them is entirely convincing and enough to get viewers rooting for them both to survive so they can get back together.Judging by the end credits, the location seems to have been in and around St Kitts and Nevis but presumably the tiny two-island nation didn’t want to scare off potential tourists. Even so it’s as if this film was made specifically by and for middle-aged and older West Indians who value manners, chivalry and community. All those values are elevated in the final act when, after a rousing speech in a church from Mark, the whole island comes out to help Mark, Akilah and Mark’s smartass police buddy Phil to take down the cartel boss and his gang. Bless! The Island is released on 29 January on digital platforms."
Presence review – Steven Soderbergh’s intriguing ghost story experiment,Sundance film festival: The director tells a haunted house tale from the perspective of the spirit in a visually interesting yet dramatically underwhelming gambit,3,"For the majority of film-makers, the restrictions insisted by Covid became a stifling force and created a clear dividing line between those who could flourish in extremely prohibitive circumstances and those who could not. Steven Soderbergh, a director who has never allowed anything – from Oscar glory to blockbuster success – to kill his plucky spirit of invention, made one of the only essential pandemic movies with the maddeningly underseen thriller Kimi, a sleek and canny new-tech upgrade of a paranoid 70s thriller. He found a way, along with the screenwriter David Koepp, to maximise limitations and the two have smartly reunited for a project that carries on-paper similarities.Presence, a project shrouded in trademark mystery, shot over last summer with a waiver and now unveiling at Sundance, is another one-location genre exercise, playfully riffing on age-old tropes and allowing Soderbergh, as both director and cinematographer, the opportunity to experiment. This time he’s playing with the conventions of haunted house horror, his film told from the perspective of the ghost situated in a recently renovated house, new inhabitants moving in – a family, led by Lucy Liu and the This is Us actor Chris Sullivan with the newcomers Callina Liang and Eddy Maday as their teenage children. Like families often do in this genre, they’re arriving with excess baggage, tensions they hope will dissipate in a new home, a fresh start after a period of unease.Soderbergh shoots a series of unbroken sequences as the presence witnesses the family fraying – a daughter grieving the loss of a friend, a mother prioritising her son as favourite, a father concerned about a potential legal battle – and we’re left to decipher what it all might mean and where we might be going. For a while, the experiment really works, questions over who the spirit might be remaining unanswered along with its intentions, clarification over what genre we’re even in remaining fascinatingly murky. Gliding around the house, Soderbergh has fun finding ways to involve us in the story, snippets and observations building up an unusual image of a family in trouble, from the micro to the macro, and some bold touches of music suggest that we’re going somewhere emotionally grand. But intrigue starts to waver as the picture, and genre, gets clearer.The more we get to know the family, the harder it becomes to believe their dynamic, Koepp’s vision of division a little too heavy-handed; mother and son emerging as cartoonishly awful counterparts to the saintliness of father and daughter. The more relatable passive-aggression starts to get nastier but the powder keg fizzles rather than ignites and when a more conventional thriller plot comes into play, it’s equally hard to buy, the delicately dropped crumbs of mystery leading us to a surprisingly rote reveal. It’s half-hearted when it should be full-throated and by the end, it’s only the visual gimmick that separates this from standard genre fare.As an experiment, it remains of interest, something to be filed away as a curious technical exercise, and Soderbergh operating at a lower level is still higher than many of his peers. Presence just never fully comes together in the way we hope, a ghost story haunted more by the possibility of what it could have been.Presence is showing at the Sundance film festival and is seeking distribution"
Forever Young review– anti-ageing fantasy drama kept alive by magnetic Diana Quick ,"Quick plays a 70-year-old writer who takes a new treatment that could enable her to have a child. She is emotionally transparent and intellectually engaged, unlike the film",2,"Diana Quick makes a return to the big screen – after a six-year break – with a first-rate performance in a second-rate (perhaps third-rate) film. Forever Young is a ploddingly drab British sci-fi drama that really doesn’t have what it takes to keep up with Quick; she stars as a 70-year-old writer taking an unlicensed drug to reverse the ageing process. It’s impossible to take your eyes off her: intellectually engaged and emotionally transparent. It’s a pity then that the script is unserious and uninteresting, with nothing to say either about the existential leap in the dark of eternal youth or the ethics of the anti-ageing industry.Quick is Robyn, a bestselling author who’s been happily married to Oscar (Bernard Hill) for donkey’s years. Robyn’s big regret is her decision not to have kids. Then, one day, she gets a shock opening the door to an old flame, Jim, who miraculously looks 40 younger. Jim is a scientist who has invented an anti-ageing drug; now he wants Robyn to take it. She agrees, but husband Oscar refuses. At which point Quick exits, replaced by Amy Tyger as her younger self, and (no offence to Tyger) the movie gets very slack.You have to put up with implausibilities and plot-holes by the shovel load. Robyn takes the age-reversing drug because she wants to have a baby – but doesn’t appear to ask a single question about the possible side effects. There’s also a painfully unconvincing subplot involving Jim’s daughter, an aggro drug addict and sex worker. In the end, this is a shallow drama passing itself off as saying something meaningful. It left me empty and the only question I was asking by the end is, can someone please write a stunning lead role worthy of Diana Quick? Forever Young is released on 26 January in UK cinemas."
This Blessed Plot review – offbeat docu-drama explores Englishness in Essex,A Chinese film-maker and an Arsenal-supporting widower converge in a small Essex town in this strange but absorbing take on pastoral England,3,"There’s an eccentric Englishness in this quirky, microbudget feature from screenwriter Adam Ganz and director Marc Isaacs. They have created a kind of docu-fictional guided reality, a weird soap set in the picturesque Essex town of Thaxted, known for its association with the composer Gustav Holst who was entranced by its beauty and established a music festival there with the encouragement of its Christian socialist vicar, Conrad Noel.Ganz and Isaacs have got some present-day Thaxted inhabitants to play heightened or fictionally modified versions of themselves, in a story interspersed with black-and-white clips from Ripe Earth, the Boulting brothers’ early short film from 1938, also set in Thaxted. Lori (Yingge Lori Yang) is a young Chinese film-maker who has come to Thaxted to record the local traditions, especially the morris dancing, but finds herself drawn into the world of Keith (Keith Martin), a fierce Arsenal fan, devastated by the recent loss of his wife, who looked after his financial affairs, but may not have been faithful to him. Conrad Noel’s ghostly voice speaks to Lori, explaining how socialism grows naturally from the teachings of Christ, and she is also visited by the ghost of Keith’s late wife who is tormented by her need to confess from beyond the grave.As for Thaxted itself, it isn’t exactly the Shakespearean “demi-paradise” declaimed by Keith. There is what looks like a nasty altercation in the pub, occasioned by Lori’s presence, and Isaacs allows us to glimpse what looks like someone in minstrel blackface in an old photograph of a morris dancing scene. There are, however, no mentions of Brexit. An odd, but diverting modern pastoral scene, which refuses a parochial view of England. This Blessed Plot is released on 26 January in UK cinemas."
Love Me review – Kristen Stewart and Steven Yeun explore love in oddball sci-fi,Sundance film festival: the Oscar-nominated actors star as a buoy and a satellite falling for each other after the world has ended in a head-scratching experiment,2,"At Sundance, a festival geared towards acquisition with unsold films going for the hard sell, there’s something intriguing about those that withhold. While for mysterious romance Love Me, the involvement of the Oscar nominees Kristen Stewart and Steven Yeun was enough by itself to vault the film to the top of many wishlists, its logline was less of a sure thing. A post-apocalyptic love story between a buoy and a satellite was something that people would have to see to understand and so there was an unusual sense of curious excitement in the air at its packed-out premiere, no one quite sure what was about to be experienced.But while the curiosity might have sustained itself for the most part, the excitement slowly faded, the film an alluring but ultimately failed experiment. Rather than giving us something we truly haven’t seen before, it falls too closely in line with other recent films that have felt less like standalone acts of original creation and more like discarded Black Mirror episodes. While not quite as deadening as Foe or Fingertips, it leaves us with a similar sense of frustration, the not particularly gratifying act of witnessing an idea being workshopped in real time, happier with itself than we are watching it.It starts with a bold, and bleak, look into the future. Humanity is long gone and a digitally assisted smart buoy (voiced by Stewart) is all alone. One day, it encounters a satellite (voiced by Yeun), charged with explaining the end of the world to any life form it might encounter. Their fractured communication starts to evolve into something more human as they develop a sense of what it is to be alive via shreds of a long-expired internet. As they get closer, they start to change form, modelled after two vacuous influencers, playing at being in love before starting to question what real love is.The first-time film-makers Sam and Andy Zuchero have certainly not picked the easy route with their debut, spanning billions of years and combining animation, live-action and some stunning, expansive visuals. But ambition only takes the film so far, a big swing aiming to comment on and cover so much, too much, that it deserves only admiration for trying rather than applause for succeeding. The initial scenes, which bring to mind the opening stretch of Wall-E, are the most endearing, as the two objects try to work out a way to communicate and define themselves. The swerve that follows, as the film turns the pair into animated avatars of the influencers that one of then covets, has its moments, with the pair stuck in an endless cycle of making Blue Apron spon-con trying to break out of the formula into something authentic. But the film’s grasp of the internet and its jabs at social media feel too broad and far too dated, repeatedly hammering easy targets into nothing.The Zucheros flit between almost compelling quandaries about the trap of idealised straight romance and the hell of expected performance within it to more rote and repetitive observations about gender. It’s all strangely stacked against its female character, who is painted as an irrational, deceitful nag, while its male lead is merely trying to find himself outside of the dynamic she has forced on to them. A more entertaining film might have turned this into a thriller but with its loudly beating heart on its sleeve, Love Me wants to be a sweeping romance instead, insisting us to reach emotional heights that the film just can’t take us to (a score that intercuts between lush Michael Giacchino-esque highs and intrusively annoying jazzy lows doesn’t help matters). It feels like a short that was expanded without enough thought for how it might work as a whole movie and by the end, even that curiosity has faded too.Like Stewart, Yeun has worked hard to distance himself from the limits of the genre franchise that made him, taking left-field turns when offered, picking actor over movie star, and this marks another interestingly offbeat choice for them both. They do what they can with their multiple personas but there’s forever a disconnect with what we’re being told and how we’re then made to feel, in a film wanting desperately to be loved that makes it near impossible.Love Me is screening at the Sundance film festival and is seeking distribution"
Freaky Tales review – Pedro Pascal-led 80s anthology isn’t freaky enough,"Sundance film festival: Captain Marvel directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck have made a bizarrely misjudged hodgepodge of gore, needle drops and nostalgia",2,"More often than not, the opening night slot at Sundance has become more curse than blessing, too many films living and dying in just one night, barely to be seen again. Emilia Clarke and Chiwetel Ejiofor’s sci-fi comedy The Pod Generation anyone? How about the Michelle Williams and Julianne Moore melodrama After the Wedding? Daisy Ridley’s suicide drama Sometimes I Think About Dying? Or maybe that sequel to An Inconvenient Truth that you didn’t even know existed? This year’s sacrificial lamb, the 80s-set anthology Freaky Tales, is nothing if not confident in its ability to make an impact, asserting itself as an experience that won’t easily be forgotten.Acting as its own hype man, the film begins with a block of narrated opening text positioning what we’re about to see as a “hella wild” ride, a promise that had already been made during its introduction, excitably sold to us as something that would make certain audience members’ heads explode. But while the film’s makers – the writer-director duo Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck – might seem to think that they’ve made a new cult classic, it’s hard to share in their bullish enthusiasm, eye-rolling fatigue meeting their insistence that this is something to be quoted, rewatched and adored. For as bold as Boden and Fleck seem to think Freaky Tales is, it’s a hodgepodge of things we’ve seen done before and done better, a sub-Tarantino fanboy assembly of vaguely interconnected stories that belongs less in the 80s and more in the mid-to-late 90s when every American indie wannabe was trying to emulate their new icon.We’re taken back to 1987, dropped into a vibrant but tense Oakland, California, and told about a glowing green substance that has an unusual effect on those who encounter it. There are punks taking on Nazis (led by Scream 7’s Jack Champion and the Expats newcomer Ji-young Yoo), a pair of female rappers taking on a rap battle (an acting debut for Normani alongside Wakanda Forever’s Dominique Thorne, a standout), a debt-collecting killer for hire taking on his bosses (the man of the moment Pedro Pascal and Ben Mendelsohn, regrettably going full ham) and an NBA star taking on the criminals who have targeted his life (the Insecure star Jay Ellis). The stories are presented as separate, titled tales but often intertwine, connective tissue being the theme of the underdog. But what should be easy catharsis – skinheads, racists, misogynists, homophobes and killers all being avenged, often violently – is made hard by Boden and Fleck’s inability to give us a rousing win. The battles that take place, whether they’re fought by words or action, are all flubbed; rushed and poorly developed involving characters we know little of doing something we don’t really care about. Cheers replaced by shrugs.Boden and Fleck came to Sundance in 2006 with the punchy and persuasive Ryan Gosling drama Half Nelson but have had a strange, off-key career since. There have been highs – the sensitive baseball story Sugar – but more recently lows – the point and shoot anonymity of Captain Marvel. On paper, Freaky Tales seems like a response to the thankless grunt work of operating within the MCU and it’s clearly a film that has personal resonance for the pair but it becomes the most alienating type of one-for-us project, a self-indulgent home movie somehow made for the big screen. Their nostalgia for the era is shown to us in a string of lists, naming 80s films for the sake of naming 80s films, at its worst in an embarrassing video store scene involving a bizarre A-list cameo running through the best underdog movies of all time. The same can be said of the music, needle-drop upon needle-drop, encouraging the kind of point-at-the-screen “I know that too” nostalgia that has consumed so much of pop culture, as if the mere act of recognition is enough.The plotting is sloppy but somehow smug, a mystery box put together by people too focused on the wrapping to care about what’s inside (a double-bill with Saltburn awaits!). There’s an over-reliance on pointless visual gimmicks, (did we need an animated baseball sequence or an aspect ratio change or two characters’ inner thoughts represented as doodles?) but the film is otherwise sleekly made and post-Marvel, shows the pair to have developed as strong commercial film-makers. The final gory setpiece is effectively choreographed if a little too pastiche-y to stick, yet like so much of the film, seems as if it were based on a graphic novel, making the film a strange and ungainly companion piece to Captain Marvel. Is it their attempt to have the fun they wanted from that project but on their own terms? Maybe. But for a film so clearly designed to be fun above all else, it ends up being a bizarre slog. I’m glad they enjoyed themselves so much, shame we couldn’t join in.Freaky Tales is showing at the Sundance film festival and is seeking distribution"
Girls State review – compelling follow-up to hit documentary,"Sundance film festival: Film-makers Jesse Moss and Amanda McBaine struck gold with their film on a mock government program for 1,000 teenage boys. Now, it’s the girls’ turn.",4,"In 2018, film-makers Jesse Moss and Amanda McBaine struck gold – or, rather, tuned into it – when they attended a weeklong Texas program in which 1,000 teenage boys elect and run a mock state government. Their subsequent film, Boys State, bottled the potential and peril of the future – the idealism and ambition of youth, the capacity to change one’s mind, the allure of power, the corrosive codes of masculinity – into two hours at once terrifying and hopeful, winning the 2020 Sundance documentary grand jury prize.Now the duo returns to the festival with Girls State, a similarly structured look at a Boys State sister program in Missouri. Though the mock government programs, run by the American Legion, remain (controversially, to some) separated by sex in the state, the film captures the first time in its 80-year history that the two coexist on the same campus, at the same time, in the summer of 2022. For the boys, it’s business as usual, relayed in occasional snippets familiar from the first project – exercises on a football field, delegate meetings, rituals blessed by real-life politicians.The girls have a looser, less formal program, at least judging by the film’s ambling first half, despite higher stakes; the participants gather weeks after the leaked Dobbs draft opinion overturning Roe v Wade. Their rights as decided by committee are very much top of mind, something everyone – a Catholic sticking to “pro-life”, a conservative who wouldn’t push it on others, a pro-choicer schooled in the talking points of “abortion is healthcare” all at the same cafeteria table and trying to be friendly – seems to agree on.As in the first film, Moss and McBaine embed with several participants across the political spectrum, with various pains and ambitions, to fascinating effect. There’s Emily, an almost scarily real-life Tracy Flick, blond and determined and brittle, a conservative pastor’s daughter who announces her plan to run for president in 2040; she is one of several to run for governor, the week’s highest office and most competitive position. She warily eyes Faith, her blond rival in doggedness, a young woman even less patient with societal expectations for female docility. (The program, perhaps unsurprisingly, skews white and blond; more than once, it resembles sorority rush.) Some, like Brooke, Maddie and Nisha, are less sure; part of the film’s magnetic, if cliched, sweetness is in watching each grow their confidence over one intense, clarifying week.There’s tartness, too – Tochi, one of the few Black participants, responds to questions from white girls who have no idea how to talk about her Nigerian heritage with clipped, firm politeness. “I’m having fun,” says Cecilia, a proto-liberal activist, through gritted teeth as she debates Emily on gun control. All of the girls grow dismayed with the structure of the Girls State program, which Moss and McBaine keep somewhat frustratingly opaque, at least in the first half. Some of the rules are clear – girls must always go outside with a buddy for safety, girls must stay covered up (the boys have no such strictures, of course) – but there’s no delineation of days nor context for what, exactly, the girls are doing as they walk around in groups or mill about in the cafeteria. The girls eventually seem frustrated by this, too – too much emphasis on cheery female empowerment and modesty, not enough on actual issues or, say, inequalities between the programs. As one puts it: “I’m a little sick of the fluff.”Good thing the latter half of the film gets down to business: a mock supreme court case on Missouri’s law requiring any woman seeking an abortion to get counseling, and then the governor’s election, both rendered with the seriousness palpable in the room. As with Boys State, the directors smartly take a back seat, catching the pieces as they fall. The film’s chief enjoyment is seeing how motivations transform, and character is forged, through the sliding doors of new people, victories and losses, and the sharpening of the young women’s disparate judgments on the genuinely disappointing differences between boys and girls state. The apparent aimlessness of the week’s first half coalesces into a point: these are not the same programs.And though they share similar sensibilities, these are not the same films. Necessarily so, as the dynamics of womanhood in politics – of getting people to believe you, of leadership, of conviction – are more steep and delicate than for the boys, interesting in a different way. If Girls State ties a neater bow on the individual mock government experience than its predecessor, it’s with the gut-punch postscript that mere days after their session wrapped, the decision to overturn Roe v Wade became official. The votes in Girls State may have been symbolic, the words occasionally petty, the politicking fraught and sometimes annoying, but stakes are – and rightfully feel – very real.Girls State is screening at the Sundance film festival with a release to follow this year on Apple TV+"
Ghostlight review – charming tale of DIY Shakespeare theater,Sundance film festival: Triangle of Sadness star Dolly De Leon steals scenes in an endearing story of a real family wrapped up in a lo-fi staging of Romeo and Juliet,4,"The film-makers Kelly O’Sullivan and Alex Thompson know their way around the peaks and valleys of the everyday. Their breakout 2019 feature Saint Frances, written and starring O’Sullivan, sublimated what could be big strokes of drama – abortion, postpartum depression, getting older, lost time – into the unremarkable (on the outside) relationship between an aimless 34-year-old and her six-year-old nannying charge. The daily humors and challenges in one woman’s life were not particularly dramatic or arresting, but rendered with such curiosity and acceptance as to feel radical.Ghostlight, the duo’s new feature premiering at the Sundance film festival, traffics in a similar leveling of mundanity and insight. (It’s also written by O’Sullivan.) There’s an appealing naturalness to the project, probably owing to its tight-knit origins: O’Sullivan and Thompson are real-life partners directing a real-life family in their city, Chicago. Dan Mueller (Keith Kupferer) is an emotionally bottled construction worker, all slumped shoulders and soft mumblings, except for the few moments he bursts forth with startling rage. He’s distant from wife Sharon (Kupferer’s wife Tara Mallen), an elementary school music teacher seeking to reconnect. Neither know how to handle Daisy (their daughter Katherine Mallen Kupferer, bristling with talent), a high-schooler with a near-terminal case of teenage nightmare syndrome. It’s often funny, how easily Daisy can escalate and derail a moment, until O’Sullivan’s finely tuned script and Mallen Kupferer’s hot-blooded performance reveal just how derailed she is.As in Saint Frances, a chance encounter turns into a near-instant avenue for redemption: through contrivance and invitation, Dan ends up at a table read for a very DIY community theater production of Romeo and Juliet. The company is an island of misfit toys, according to its leader Rita, a hard-shelled ex-Broadway actor and self-described bitch played by Dolly De Leon. As in Triangle of Sadness, she blazes in every scene, not missing a single ego-deflating punchline. This production of Romeo and Juliet is not a glamorous gig, and Dan is not a natural theater actor. But the process of theater – exercises, rehearsal, bonding, fighting, garbling iambic pentameter – begin to open up his deep well of grief.The Kupferer-Mallens are Chicago theater stalwarts, having founded their own company, and the affection everyone involved with this project feels for the stage – as an art, therapy and practice – is so evident as to be contagious, even in the film’s most theater-y meta moments. It helps that O’Sullivan’s default tone as a writer is sardonic, with an eye for human foibles and everyday indignities. The members of Rita’s theater collective are, unsurprisingly but endearingly, eccentric theater types (in the case of one recently graduated college student harping about intimacy coordinators, a bit too much of a caricature). All talk the talk of getting into the headspace of a character, yet are never not themselves; their charming quirkiness buoys the film as it inches closer to the Muellers’ unimaginable pain, the contours of which are steadily revealed over the film’s two hours.O’Sullivan demonstrated a penchant for heavy-handedness in Saint Frances, and dabbles in it here; the parallels between the Muellers’ loss and Shakespeare’s tragedy are a bit too square to buy. If anything, Ghostlight’s crime is of being too well-structured, its alignment between the real and the pretend too synchronous to match the film’s otherwise finely worn, wholly believable texture and Kupferer’s sublime performance. That texture is at once familiar and rare. Though Dan and his family have experienced unusual, devastating grief, the scenery of their lives is ordinary, ornery and humbling: car horns, work sites, road rage; a talent-free elementary school musical; therapy appointments and lawyerly meetings for an upcoming deposition – the Muellers are involved in a lawsuit – in cookie-cutter offices. In other words, the vast yet underappreciated, on screen, purview of people in unsung places trying their best to make things work.Even when pockmarked with tragedy, the Muellers never feel special, in the typical cinematic sense of remarkable beauty, power or circumstances. But that doesn’t make their experience, or the film’s achievement in rendering the specific healing of one family, any less profound.Ghostlight is showing at the Sundance film festival and is seeking distribution"
Role Play review – action comedy wastes Kaley Cuoco and David Oyelowo,A competent yet boringly unoriginal caper sees a married couple forced into action when the wife’s secret job as an assassin comes to light,2,"Rather like the studio horror movie, the bar for the action comedy has lowered so dramatically that the mere act of not tripping over it headfirst is now considered enough. Modeled after an old-fashioned, something-for-him and something-for-her date-night formula, they tend to involve attractive stars smugly quipping at each other while sleekly avoiding pop-soundtracked gunfire, all theoretically allowing for the opportunity to show off dual personas, class clown and jock rolled into one.But the magic that was on display in 2005’s magnetic Mr & Mrs Smith, a film that has arguably had the most visible, and damaging, impact on the genre in the almost two decades since (itself heavily in debt to 1994’s True Lies), has been almost entirely absent in its many imitators. Last year’s hauntingly awful Chris Evans-Ana de Armas starrer Ghosted acted as an almost instructive what-not-to-do, a punishing, unintentional parody of what these films have become in a year in which there seemed to be more of them than ever before. To kick off the new year with yet another – male-female pairing: check; one of them is a spy/assassin: check – is not the most thrilling prospect but with many, many more to come in the next 12 months (Jamie Foxx and Cameron Diaz in Back in Action, Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt in The Fall Guy, Donald Glover’s Mr & Mrs Smith TV series), it’s about finding the silver lining where possible.For Amazon’s Role Play, it’s more like bronze, the great victory being that it’s really not as atrocious as these films too often are, bar lazily stumbled over. A lot of that’s down to what these films are usually saved by – star power – and while the stars in question here might be slightly lower-wattage, in industry terms at least, there’s enough energy on display to almost power the whole thing, a sprint when a sleepwalk is usually deemed enough. It’s becoming a familiar mode for Kaley Cuoco, a long-time sitcom star who received an unlikely career boost from the breakout hit The Flight Attendant and has been chasing that high ever since. That show’s initially invigorating yet ultimately exhausting mix of comedy and thriller was also seen in her next film – the Kevin Hart vehicle The Man from Toronto – and her next show – last year’s Based on a True Story.She’s trying again here, playing a suburban mum who also happens to be a globe-trotting assassin, keeping that quiet from her husband, played by David Oyelowo. But the all-consuming nature of her job is starting to eat away at their relationship and after she forgets their anniversary, the pair decide to spice things up a bit, engaging in a bit of role play at a hotel in the city. They’ll meet in the lobby, pretend to be strangers and take things back to a room. But when a nosey stranger, played by Bill Nighy, intervenes, things go awry.What follows is exactly what one would expect – a shootout, a chase, a shadowy organisation – but never enough of what one wouldn’t, a familiar mish-mash in need of a persuaive reason to exist. It’s a mostly adequate version of that movie – it’s never as unfunny or as maddeningly incoherent as these things can be – but it’s crucially lacking in such a way that I often forgot I was watching something self-contained, and that perhaps it were a pilot for a show, maybe by the end of the season I’ll see why we’re here again.Modulating the silly and the serious in a way that she often struggled with in Based on a True Story, Cuoco’s performance does manage an awful lot of heavy lifting here, and she has some real chemistry with an all-in Oyelowo, the pair briefly showing us what they could do together with a script that was able to challenge them. But here there’s never enough detail or perversity or gristle to catapult them from two-line types in a treatment to actual characters in a movie let alone something approximating real people. Thanks to the sorry state of the action comedy genre as is, Role Play isn’t a total loss but it’s still much too far from a win.Role Play is available on Amazon Prime on 12 January"
Lift review – Kevin Hart a hard sell in ho-hum heist flick,Netflix’s big-budget action film from Fast & Furious’s F Gary Gray pairs slick sequences with Hart’s unconvincing art thief,3,"You know the Netflix formula: take a reliable box office trope – the big-budget action movie, the international spy thriller, the hitman and car chase bonanza – repackage it for the laptop screen with evermore disposable wrapping, attach a big name star with a hefty paycheck, release, move on. Such results – Sweet Girl, The Adam Project, The Gray Man, just to name a few – are often widely viewed yet under-discussed, throwaway blockbusters in the house style (overlit, frenetic) without much staying power or distinguishable flair. (To be fair to Netflix, this afflicts the other streaming services – does anyone remember Apple’s Ghosted?)So there are well-worn and reduced expectations going into Lift, the latest collaboration between Netflix, the comedian Kevin Hart and a tried and true concept (in this case, clever thieves with expensive toys and menacing bad guys). The film does little to outrun them. You know from the first minute, in which Hart’s debonair conman Cyrus Whitaker strolls confidently into a Venetian art auction, that this is a streaming action flick – stock characters, music video flairs, wealth porn, limp flashes of personality appealing to a low common denominator.At least Lift, written by Daniel Kunka, enlists the multiplex-tested know-how of F Gary Gray, director of The Italian Job, Straight Outta Compton and Fast & Furious 8 (as well as such music videos as Ice Cube’s It Was a Good Day and TLC’s Waterfalls). The plot in Lift is dumb in a way that’s either entertaining or grating, depending on your preferences and current brain capacity. Such as: an opening heist plotline in Venice centered around an NFT, and then subsequent half-jokes about how NFTs were dismissed as a passing fad. But Gray knows how to direct a cacophonous action sequence, and the cat-and-mouse chase that plays out between Cyrus and the Interpol officer Abby Gladwell (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) in the canals of Venice is impressive and enjoyably stressful (I fear the wakes may sink the city faster).Hart, usually cast as the wacky, hapless foil, the good guy doing his best or the everyman sidekick (such as in The Man from Toronto, a Netflix action flick I reviewed but had to Google, so little did it stick), plays against type here as a hyper-competent leader of a heist ring who, of course, only steals from people who deserve it. It’s an ill fit for his physical, loud brand of comedy, which can’t help but poke through his attempts at suave charisma. Hart delivers such straight-faced lines as “the rules were already broken for someone like me” with an awkward edge, like he’s itching for a punchline.That line is used to (unconvincingly) charm Abby, with whom Cyrus once shared a five-day fling while both were undercover that curdled into distrust. For reasons that never make much sense but don’t need to, Abby’s boss Huxley (Sam Worthington, believably strained and skeevy) orders her to make peace with her art thief nemesis in the name of world peace; if Cyrus and his crew don’t nick $50m worth of gold bars while in transit from London to Zurich, then the arch-evil billionaire Lars Jorgenson (Jean Reno) will pay hackers to wreak havoc for profit (he’s shorted some stocks, or something; Northern Irish henchmen are involved).If this sounds like a bastardized version of Ocean’s 11 with a Fast and Furious flavor, you would be correct. Still, Hart may not be a convincing crew boss, but again, Gray knows how to direct an action sequence. There’s a baseline pleasure to watching the crew get to improbable work on stealing both the gold and the commercial jet ferrying it – the daredevil pilot Camilla (Úrsula Corberó), the over-caffeinated safecracker Magnus (a delightful Billy Magnussen), the hacker Mi-Sun (Yun Jee Kim), the engineer Luc (Viveik Kalra) and the disguise expert Denton (Vincent D’Onofrio). Maybe I’m primed by a door falling off a Boeing 737 mid-air recently, but the in-flight sequences once the plot is afoot – time-crunched logistics, hand-to-hand combat during turbulence, a couple plane barrel rolls – raised my blood pressure.In other words, there’s plenty to keep many viewers watching for its 1-hour, 44-minute runtime. But given the bare characterization for everyone and the total lack of chemistry between Hart and Mbatha-Raw (despite her best efforts), not enough to elevate Lift above its many forgotten peers.Lift is on Netflix on 12 January"
The Beekeeper review – Jason Statham’s John Wick is serviceable schlock,The actor stays in the same lane to play a trained killer taking down the bad guys in David Ayer’s enjoyably silly time-waster,3,"If you’re not in the market for what David Ayer is forcefully selling in batty January thriller The Beekeeper at the point when someone says to the titular character, “To bee or not to bee, that is the bloody question,” then you might as well just give up and walk out. By this stage, late in the film, Ayer and screenwriter Kurt Wimmer have given us just about enough bee puns, bone cracks and bizarre cameos from British actors to give those in the right headspace (read: drunk) a solid, low-stakes, medium-reward new year’s effort. I can’t imagine a devoted Beekeeper hive emerging any time soon (it’s far too derivative and far too rough around the edges), but there’s enough energy and well-pitched silliness to have audiences, ahem, swarming to cinemas this weekend.It’s primed as Jason Statham’s John Wick (not that the actor needs another franchise since out of his last 10 movies, only two were not part of a series) and its desperation to be so can often be distracting, but in a crowded landscape of equally desperate imitators, it makes a more persuasive case than most. Statham knows exactly what to do here, more than most would, and has figured out just how seriously, or not, to take such material. During the cold open, you’d be forgiven for thinking that this was going to be more serious than most. He plays a withdrawn beekeeper working on land owned by a retired teacher, played by the luminous and wasted Phylicia Rashad. In a surprisingly wrenching set-up, she gets hoodwinked by a crooked call centre into allowing access to her accounts, leading to automatic bankruptcy and a self-inflicted bullet through the head. Statham is spurred into tackling the system that preyed on her and so a mission begins.It’s an effectively involving motivator, although Ayer rushes through it so fast that one can sense his boredom shooting a scene without shooting (a shame as more of Rashad and her relationship with Statham wouldn’t have gone amiss). It introduces her FBI agent daughter (a wildly unconvincing Emmy Raver-Lampman) and allows for the start of some hilariously rubbish dialogue delivered with a very grave face (“Taking from an elderly person is as bad as stealing from a child ... maybe worse!”) as well as many, often confusing, lines involving bees (“When someone hurts an older person, sometimes they’re left to face the hornets alone!”). In screenwriter Kurt Wimmer’s world, a beekeeper isn’t just a beekeeper but is also a trained assassin, part of a hive protecting the queen bee, which means that the FBI agents on his trail are forced to, you know, read books on beekeeping to get to the bottom of this.Like most of these films, it’s then structured like a video game all the way to the Big Bad Boss. Given that it was set in the US but filmed in the UK, these road stops involve an underused Minnie Driver, a snarling Jeremy Irons and a dead-behind-the-eyes Jemma Redgrave, none of them having anywhere near as much fun as Josh Hutcherson’s obnoxious nepo baby tech bro. Bizarrely and ambitiously, the Beekeeper finds that the honey leads all the way to the White House and Wimmer aims to vaguely make some sort of commentary about the fine line between the evils of politics and the evils of big business. But then not really, he’s not taking any of this all that seriously, proven in a finale that’s all action and little talk (an ebulliently gory hallway fight scene is a real blast) and an end-note that clumsily leaves things open for more.Statham is ever the pro (one wonders if he’s had enough training at this stage to make a dangerously good assassin for real), but it’s all more of the same. His two non-franchise films of late showed how great he can be when afforded both a little more lightness (Operation Fortune) and a lot more darkness (Wrath of Man), and it would be satisfying to see him try something just a little out of the ordinary next. He works well with Ayer, who himself works better on a smaller, gnarlier scale, allowed more freedom to get nasty (his Suicide Squad remains a great-looking, what-if disaster). There’s a grubby, late-night appeal to his dialled-up trash aesthetic and The Beekeeper mostly works because of it. Bee prepared for a sequel.The Beekeeper is in UK, Australian and US cinemas on 12 January"
Mean Girls review – high-school sadism comedy as sugar-rush movie musical,"In some ways the musical format suits Mean Girls better than the original movie version, with Angourie Rice in the role once occupied by Lindsay Lohan",3,"The high school comedy of status-sadism now reaches the same third life-cycle stage already achieved by Hairspray, The Producers and The Color Purple: the movie, the stage musical version and then the movie version of that. My own dissident reaction to the 2004 original was a mean review based on feeling it was inferior to Clueless, Election and 10 Things I Hate About You, and that it had its cake and ate it on the prettiness-fascism issue.But I could have paid more attention to the showstopping individually funny lines; screenwriter Tina Fey after all went on to create an authentic masterpiece with TV’s 30 Rock, in which she could more successfully represent in her own person the eternal Mean Girls themes of reconciling success with kindness. Moreover the Broadway Mean Girls was a big improvement on the film because the musical genre makes everything more amusingly histrionic – the “diva” theme made explicit – and this movie version succeeds in the same way, although like the subsequent movie iteration it sags in the over-extended third act.Angourie Rice takes the role first played by Lindsay Lohan: she is sweet, unworldly teen Cady, once homeschooled by her academic mom in Kenya, and now relocated to the United States and having to fit in at high school where everyone is suspicious of this gawky (but beautiful) nerd. Fey reprises her role as maths teacher Ms Norbury, Jon Hamm plays an embarrassing sports-coach-slash-sexual-relations-counsellor – and there’s another iconic cameo.In the time-honoured manner, newbie Cady is taken in hand and guided through the high-school jungle by the all-knowing alienated cynical types; great work here from Jaquel Spivey as Damian and Auli’i Cravalho as Janis. They are also the movie choric narrators, bringing us into the action as if it is a 112-minute TikTok in a smartphone-shaped screen. Damian and Janis, outside the hetero-patriarchal power structure, are in an objective position to show wide-eyed Cady all the various in-crowds and power-bases, of which naturally the most fearsome are the terrifying “plastics”, the mean girls and Insta-princesses who rule the school.They are in turn ruled by the pouting queen of capricious blonde cruelty Regina, originally played by Rachel McAdams and now by Renée Rapp. It amuses Regina to pretend to welcome Cady into their group and Janis (who has history with Regina) encourages Cady to go along with it and infiltrate this hateful group - but could it be that Cady will like being a shallow blonde “plastic”? Among the mean girls themselves, the scene is stolen by Avantika as the outrageously vapid Karen; she gets the movie’s best song, Sexy, in the Halloween party scene. Busy Phillips is funny as Regina’s needy mom who wants to be one of her daughter’s gang more than anything.There are plenty of laughs and fun along the way, but the business invoking framing Ms Norbury as a drug-pusher always feels strained and unconvincing, with insufficient laughs to make it worthwhile, while the final resolution and Cady’s learning of life-lessons take a while to arrive. Some sugar-rush musical numbers, though, and the classic gags are effectively delivered.

Lord of Misrule review – vicar blesses harvest-festival horror in Wicker Man rehash,Director William Brent Bell turns in a poor man’s reworking of the Brit-horror classic that can’t work up a proper head of suspense,2,"In a quaint village somewhere in the north, judging by the accents, the new vicar Rebecca Holland (Tuppence Middleton) seems to think she’s made some progress connecting with the locals. Mind you, turnout for Sunday services yields barely enough souls for a game of five-a-side. But the community seems friendly enough to her and her husband Henry (Matt Stokoe), and they seem to have paid the family a compliment by choosing the Hollands’ pre-pubescent daughter Grace to be some kind of angel with wheat sheaf wings for the upcoming harvest festival.Alas, it seems Rebecca has never watched The Wicker Man because, if she had, she would have understood exactly what’s going on once Grace mysteriously disappears. Much of what follows is nearly a beat-for-beat rehash of director Robin Hardy and screenwriter Anthony Shaffer’s immortal 1973 folk horror classic, albeit with some significant divergences from the template in the final act. But even those twists on the original twists are sort of predictable, and in general Lord of Misrule’s director William Brent Bell (best known for the insipid Orphan prequel Orphan: First Kill) can’t work up a proper head of suspense, no matter how many poppets made of human hair and twigs he hangs on trees, or how many creepy old ladies he sets roaming around the village muttering about local demons. Poor Rebecca seems pretty slow on the uptake anyway, even when she comes across explanatory murals pictorially explaining the ancient ways round these parts, just like the ones in Midsommar.Still, the film’s best decision is to cast the great Ralph Ineson as an ambiguous local figure of note. With his basso profundo rumble of a voice and air of rough-hewn potency, he’s always a striking figure on stage and screen. Having starred in Robert Eggers’ The Witch and featured as the titular supernatural figure of mystery in The Green Knight, he’s becoming to folk horror what Barbara Steele was to 1960s Italian creepfests such as Castle of Blood and The She Beast – and I, for one, am here for it. Lord of Misrule is released on 8 January on digital platforms."
Who Is James Payton? review – jobbing Harry Potter actor gets moment in the spotlight,"Film about actor who played the father of Neville Longbottom feels like The Office meets Withnail, though doesn’t really dig deeply into its subject",3,"Who is James Payton? The simple answer is that James Payton is a jobbing actor. You’ve probably seen him in something. His two claims to some kind of fame are blink-and-you’ll-miss-em parts in a couple of franchises: Neville Longbottom’s dad in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, and Hitler in the first Captain America movie. Payton’s other credits include “geography lecturer” in The Crown and “wasted guy” in a terrible Jonathan Pryce thriller from 2005. The two franchises, however, have opened the door to a nice little side hustle: regional fan conventions where Payton sells signed photos of himself for £10.The film follows him around the “cons”, where franchise fans queue to get a selfie with Harry Potter’s mate’s dad. Payton wonders how his life got to this? “There was me thinking that one day I’d get nominated for a Bafta for some TV detective thing.” It would be easy to take the mickey. And to be fair, sometimes this documentary comes over like a cross between The Office and The Trip, with a bit of Withnail and I thrown in. (There’s a brilliant moment where a small kid heckles the world’s most half-arsed wrestlers.) But Payton has a very dry sense of humour and he sees the funny side of staying in budget motorway hotels or twiddling his thumbs in an empty community hall.But going back to the title – I’m not sure the film answers the question in any kind of satisfying manner. I would have liked a bit more prodding from director Oliver Guy-Watkins on the impact of the death of Payton’s dad when he was 12 (which is when he decided to become an actor); his divorce; and his relationship with failure, working in an industry where failure is built in. The film can be a bit of a frustrating watch at times: not so much Who is James Payton? and more Why Should We Care? Who Is James Payton? is released on 4 January on digital platforms."
Burial review – deep dive into underworld of nuclear power and its toxic legacy,"Emilija Škarnulytė’s hypnotic documentary zooms into the science of uranium and radioactivity, as well as cold war politics ",4,"Occupying the liminal space between a geological excavation and speculative realism, Emilija Škarnulytė’s hypnotic documentary effortlessly moves between the micro and the macro. Zooming into a 3D-configuration of uranium ore, the film’s opening cuts to X-ray-esque renderings of radioactive household objects, all cast in an eerie shade of sickly green. These abstractions soon give way to something seemingly concrete yet equally mysterious: the camera plunges underwater, bringing us face to face with the remains of a 1950s uranium mine in Poland, once dug out in secrecy under the Soviet Union. Slithering through the wreckage is a water python, whose glistening presence serves as a kind of cosmic counterpart to the exploitation of natural resources.Such slipperiness, both in terms of the imagery and the camera’s point of view, recurs throughout Škarnulytė’s film. Cutting to the Ignalina nuclear power station in Lithuania, a sister plant of Chernobyl, the film uses on-screen text to describe its decommissioning process, which produced millions of cubic metres of reinforced concrete structures to be demolished. This colossal waste will, hopefully, be processed at a research facility at Meuse in France, which is situated about 500 metres below sea level.Though moving through these highly technological spaces, Škarnulytė’s film also makes space for bursts of surrealism. The python reappears in the Ignalina plant, as its gleaming form coils around the station’s switchboards. Bringing together the lush forests, the mushroom clouds of nuclear tests, and closeups of a snake shedding its skin, Burial questions the very possibility of rebirth and transformation. Even as Ignalina is ground into dust and buried away from prying eyes, the political spectre of the Soviet Union control continues to lurk, as the film offers a final message of support for Ukraine. Burial is available from 5 January on True Story."
Cats in the Museum review – Russian animation worthy of the litter tray,This badly dubbed and randomly plotted tale of feline heroes protecting artworks in the Hermitage is a proper dog’s dinner,1,"A cat marooned on a desert island escapes, alongside an art connoisseur mouse, inside a floating harpsichord that somehow ends up in the Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg. And if you think that seems like a bafflingly random piece of plotting, it barely scratches the surface of this lamentably poor English-dubbed Russian animation. The cat, named Vincent (Jordan Worsley), joins forces with an elite feline squad of cultural protectors; the mouse, Maurice (Stephen Peter Krisel), views the contents of the gallery as his personal buffet. Oh, and there’s a ghost. The Christmas holidays may be long, but life’s too short to waste a minute of it with this nonsensical mess."
"Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom review – shoddy, scraped-from-the-bottom-of-the-ocean sequel","This generic, humourless marine adventure starring Jason Momoa is confirmation of just how dry the superhero well is running",2,"Yet more evidence that the superhero movie industry is foundering comes from this shoddy, scraped-from-the-bottom-of-an-ocean-trench sequel. Jason Momoa, looking a bit like a beefed-up cartoon carrot in his wildly unflattering orange supersuit, returns as Arthur, the human-born heir to the kingdom of Atlantis. He divides his time between family life in a converted lighthouse with his wife, Mera (Amber Heard), their infant son, Arthur Jr, and his royal duties – largely crushingly dull council meetings with hostile merpeople. But an enemy from his past is back, and threatens not just Arthur asnd his people but the entire world, with the use of a long-abandoned Atlantean fuel that rapidly accelerates global heating.The lazily generic plot devices (yet again, an ancient evil artefact offers unlimited powers to its holder); performances so thuddingly clunky that much of the dialogue sinks like a boulder in the sea; the lack of any humour whatsoever: these are all minor irritations compared with the picture’s glib trivialisation of the climate crisis. Time to put a barnacle in it, fish boy."
Sweet Sue review – uneven threeway drama ,"Leo Leigh, son of Mike, makes his feature debut with this prickly tale of a middle-aged woman’s difficult return to dating",3,"Middle-aged Sue (Maggie O’Neill) chalks up yet another romantic disappointment and prepares to re-enter the dating circuit, a large glass of red wine in hand. In the unlikely setting of her brother’s funeral, she meets a taciturn, leather-clad biker named Ron (Tony Pitts). A connection between them seems to fill the vacuum of loneliness. But then Sue meets Ron’s son Anthony (Harry Trevaldwyn), a flamboyant wannabe dancer and social media influencer. After a promising start, in which Sue and Anthony bond over Thai food and astrology, Anthony subsequently decides that he hates her.The uneven feature film debut from Leo Leigh (son of Mike, and it shows, in the film’s prickly empathy for its abrasive characters), Sweet Sue works best as a portrait of a complex, not wholly likable woman. Where it falters is in the relationship between Sue and the increasingly withdrawn Ron, who retreats as a character while Sue and Anthony spit insults and sequins at each other."

The Boy and the Heron review – overplotted Miyazaki still delights,"At 82, the revered director of Spirited Away and My Neighbour Totoro has made his most personal film yet – a sometimes unwieldy tale of a 12-year-old boy coming to terms with his mother’s death",3,"It’s the film that the revered animator and co-founder of Studio Ghibli Hayao Miyazaki came out of retirement to make, and it’s arguably one of his most personal. The Boy and the Heron is a strikingly beautiful, densely detailed fantasy that revisits themes and devices familiar from previous films and ties them together with elements that have a clear autobiographical resonance for the director. The dream logic of the narrative seems to have been born from the untrammelled imagination of a child rather than that of a man in his 80s. The lush orchestral score, by regular Miyazaki collaborator Joe Hisaishi, is shimmering and exultant. All the elements are in place. So it seems almost churlish to note that this is middling Miyazaki at best.Of course, a mid-level Miyazaki film is still a vastly superior entity to much of the more cynically commercial content served up by Hollywood animation studios. And it’s not as if the seductive spell has been entirely broken. But compared with, say, the beguiling simplicity of My Neighbour Totoro, or the richly realised world of Spirited Away, this sometimes feels heavy going. Some of that trademark Miyazaki magic has been stifled by overplotted, incoherent storytelling and an unwieldy final third act.The backdrop, for some of the picture at least, before it slips into parallel realms, is early 1940s wartime Japan. The boy of the title is 12-year-old Mahito (voiced by Soma Santoki in the Japanese original version and Luca Padovan in the impressive English-language dub). Shortly before the main action takes place, Mahito loses his mother in a hospital fire after a bombing raid on Tokyo. The inferno engulfing the city has a disorientating, impressionistic quality that’s distinct from the precise visual style of the rest of the film, and this striking image of a burning city is one that Miyazaki has cited as one of his earliest childhood memories. Mahito’s father is the boss of a factory that manufactures fighter planes (as was the director’s own father). He remarries, to his late wife’s younger sister Natsuko (Yoshino Kimura/Gemma Chan), and the still grieving Mahito is forced to relocate from Tokyo to the country estate where his mother and Natsuko both grew up. It’s a curious, cavernous place, populated by a staff of bickering, ancient crones; it comes with a lake and a bricked-up, semi-derelict tower in its grounds.It also has another resident: an insolent grey heron (Masaki Suda/Robert Pattinson) that seems to be taking a particular beaky interest in Mahito. At the goading behest of the heron, Mahito enters the forbidden tower and finds himself drawn into a netherworld where timelines are knitted together and the infrastructure of the whole domain is controlled by some kind of high-stakes Jenga game. Fellow inhabitants of this world include Kiriko (Kô Shibasaki/Florence Pugh), a dashing sailor and fisherwoman who is skilled in magic, and the fire maiden Himi (Aimyon/Karen Fukuhara), as well as Mahito’s new stepmother, Natsuko, and a community of giant man-eating parakeets.For a director who is so famously preoccupied with the idea of flight, Miyazaki reveals an unexpectedly complicated relationship with birds in this picture. In addition to the monstrous parakeets that eye Mahito greedily, cutlery at the ready, there is also a flock of pelicans that feed on gentle floating creatures called the Warawara. And then there’s the heron, which soon loses its elegant avian form and morphs into one of Miyazaki’s less lovely creations, a wart-encrusted, goblin-like henchman in service to the ruler of this magic kingdom – an ageing wizard who, it turns out, has a connection to Mahito’s family. Ultimately, family – even a fractured, imperfect family scarred by loss – is elevated, forming the central spine of this picture, as it does in so many of Miyazaki’s movies.Where this film stumbles is in its use of space and pacing. The unbounded fantasies of Miyazaki’s imagination work best if they are physically contained in some way – within the bathhouse of Spirited Away, the enchanted forest of Totoro, the castle in Howl’s Moving Castle. Here, the world in which Mahito finds himself is vast and limitless, and the director fills it – with characters, locations and exposition – until the whole film starts to feel a little cluttered. You long for a moment of stillness, an opportunity such as that offered by the bus-stop scene in Totoro, for contemplation and the chance to fully inhabit the miraculous creations of Miyazaki’s mind, rather than being bombarded by them.In UK and Irish cinemas from 26 December"
Band Four review – Hong Kong goes indie as musical family get the band back together,"Three generations of a talented family reunite unexpectedly, but there’s little surprising about their subsequent journey, despite its undeniable charms",3,"You’d have to have a heart of brick to take against this earnest musical drama from Hong Kong about a single parent in an indie band dealing with her failed rocker dad suddenly walking back into her life (after leaving 20 years ago when she was little). It’s a warm and watchable valentine to music and starting afresh. But I did find something a bit make-believe and naive in its feelgood message about the power of music to heal old wounds; the idea that a sentimental chord or two could strum away the kind of pain and resentment it can take years of therapy to work through.Cantopop star Kay Tse plays Cat, lead singer of Band Four, and single mum to pint-sized drumming prodigy Riley (Rondi Chan). Cat nursed her own mum through years of illness, and it’s at the funeral that her dad King makes an appearance – all of five foot nothing, a ponytail, rock star sunglasses and leather jacket. Real-life musician Teddy Robin Kwan plays it beautifully; beneath the swagger there’s an unmistakable air of genuine regret. King is back to make amends to Cat and he’s got a surprise: a teenage daughter, her half-sister. Cat is fuming but King shamelessly ingratiates himself with little Riley, who is delighted by his new grandpa and auntie.When you twig that each of the four family members can play an instrument, and that Cat’s indie group is imploding, you know exactly where this is headed. It’s not helped by director Mo Lai Yan-chi pushing too many buttons, one after the other, and piling on tragic backstories and emotionally complicated relationships. Still, there’s real sweetness and charm to the movie. I found it impossible to resist its unabashed romanticism, or the sweet ending that’s not about finding love, or fame, but happiness in the family. That said, for a film about music starring actual musicians, the songs are a bunch of forgettable drifty indie mumblers. Band Four is released on 15 December in UK cinemas."
The Three Musketeers: Milady review – Eva Green seduces in swashbuckling second instalment,Green captivates as the treacherous Milady de Winter in part two of Martin Bourboulon’s breathless Dumas adaptation,4,"There was much to admire, earlier this year, in the first rollicking film in Martin Bourboulon’s two-picture adaptation of Alexandre Dumas’s classic: the swaggering fight choreography, the ostentatious insults parried along with the swordplay, the combined charisma of the musketeers (Vincent Cassel, Romain Duris and Pio Marmaï) and D’Artagnan (François Civil), which was only slightly obscured by a period-appropriate layer of sweat and grime. But the main attraction was an irresistible Eva Green, mercurial and merciless as the treacherous Milady, a spy and general agent of mischief in the French court. If anything, this follow-up is even more enjoyable, its appeal boosted by Milady slinking on to centre stage, her weaponised sexuality backed up by her private collection of daggers and swords.The Three Musketeers: Milady picks up where the first film left off, the atmosphere at court thick with treasonous plotting, after a foiled attempt on the life of the king (Louis Garrel, stealing every scene with his air of bewigged ennui). D’Artagnan, abducted and facing torture at the hands of the granite-faced henchman of the Comte de Chalais (Patrick Mille), forms a temporary alliance with Milady. Meanwhile, war has been declared and the musketeers head to the front at the port of La Rochelle, where a bracingly vigorous action sequence follows a daring assault on a fort.The film fairly gallops through big chunks of plot, pausing only for Milady’s repeated corset-clad seduction attempts on a befuddled D’Artagnan; a bonding moment between Athos (Cassel) and his son; family strife for Aramis (Duris); and toilet breaks for the permanently wine-sodden Porthos (Marmaï). There’s a hint at the end about the possibility of further movies in the series: here’s hoping."
The Boys in the Boat review – George Clooney sports drama goes for patriotic boosterism,"The director lays on the strident messaging in this clunky film, all about the gutsy underdogs of the US rowing team at the 1936 Berlin Olympics",2,"George Clooney has been a charming and dapper Anglophile presence on the awards circuit this season while promoting the new movie he’s directed, some of which was shot not far from where he lives near Henley-on-Thames. So it’s sad to report that his film clunks harder than redwood. It is a stodgy and sententious varsity-sports underdog drama from the Depression era, a bit like his 1920s American football film Leatherheads, from 2008, but minus the comedy. Weirdly, it is as if this earnest but perfunctorily imagined film is always ordering us to feel nostalgic and sentimental about a time and place of which no one involved can have any real memory or feeling.It tells the true story of how a gutsy crew of nine guys from the humble University of Washington battled to compete for Olympic rowing gold at the Berlin games in 1936, shrugging off Ivy League snobs and Nazi cheats along the way. Screenwriter Mark L Smith (who co-scripted Alejandro González Iñárritu’s The Revenant) has adapted Daniel James Brown’s bestselling book of the same title, and Clooney directs. Joel Edgerton plays gruff and taciturn coach Al Ulbrickson, who takes the sensational decision to take his junior crew of young talents to the Olympics rather than the more seasoned seniors, and then rages at the sneering obstructionists among the US rowing authorities who would prefer the Waspy east coast bluebloods to compete for America rather than his blue-collar team who are actually better at rowing. (You might remember the meanie Winklevoss twins from David Fincher’s The Social Network in a later era: entitled snobs who learned their habits of superiority in a rowing crew at Harvard.)British actor Callum Turner plays Joe Rantz, a lonely kid from a broken home who often went hungry during his studies and got into rowing to pay for his course. Peter Guinness is British-born boatbuilder George Pocock. In Berlin, Jyuddah Jaymes plays Jesse Owens, who politely tells his cornfed, puzzled white teammates that he’s running to prove his point against the bigots in America rather than Germany. And Daniel Philpott has a Mel-Brooks-ish cameo as the bad-loser Führer himself, growling and scowling at US success.The overall effect is sturdy and unsubtle, with some very strong racing scenes which certainly toy with the audience’s expectation that surely one of these tense competitions will involve the character-building experience of losing. The Poughkeepsie Regatta features the rather amazing (and historically accurate) spectacle of cheering onlookers being carried along beside the river on a converted open railway carriage. But the dialogue scenes are often frankly comic-book level, both strident and wooden. When Joe meets-cute with his sweetheart Joyce (Hadley Robinson) they have a deafeningly loud flirtatious conversation in what appears to be a library, with other extras gazing at their books, evidently in a trance. The inner life of Coach Ulbrickson is an uninteresting mystery and that excellent performer Edgerton is wasted.You might call this a film in the booster-ish spirit of old Hollywood pictures such as Knute Rockne, All American from 1940, with Ronald Reagan as the heartwrenchingly brave football star George “the Gipper” Gipp. George “the Cloonster” Clooney is capable of putting much more on the scoreboard; this feels like an animatronic museum display.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotion The Boys in the Boat is released on 25 December in the US, on 4 January in Australia and 12 January in the UK"
Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire review – Zack Snyder’s Netflix disaster,"The director’s attempt to replicate Star Wars for smartphones is an ugly, unforgivably dull and self-serious mess",1,"Zack Snyder pitched Rebel Moon as a marriage of Seven Samurai and Star Wars, which is a bit like trying to sell your new invention as the wheel meets sliced bread. The former channeled all of Akira Kurosawa’s estimable powers in blocking, lighting and composition for battles that still merit the nearly exhausted descriptor of “epic”; the latter was a once-in-a-millennium Big Bang of raw movie stardom, snappy dialogue and transportive production design that turned a mid-budget space oddity into a culture-straddling phenomenon; both are fundamentally impossible to replicate. And so Lucasfilm passed on Snyder’s tall order, as did Warner Bros (more than once), until the good people at Netflix uncinched their readily loosened purse strings for what had gradually become the blockbuster king’s longest-simmering passion project.Yet the finished product has only the vaguest contours of ambition, diminished by a half-assedness dinkifying the latest CGI-jammed saga to decide the fate of the universe. If it can be considered complete at all, that is – this 134-minute film really only covers the getting-the-gang together phase that most movies in the genre knock out within the first half hour, a fragment of story to be wrapped up with a second installment next year. One hopes that Snyder has saved the good stuff for his climactic conclusion, and not just the grand clashes conspicuously absent from an adventure that fits and belongs on a laptop. (Longtime Snyderheads may happen upon the epiphany that his trademark slow-mo action tableaux look like screensavers more than anything else.) There’s still time for him to add character development to his ragtag band of cardboard cutouts, a tactility to his nondescript greenscreened locations, a deeper sense of meaning to the stultifyingly generic plot, and everything else that leaves a sort of polished nothingness in its lack. But by the end credits, expecting anyone to come back and find out feels like asking a lot.In film school, some professors use the familiar example of Star Wars to teach Campbellian mythmaking, the theories that identify and codify the narrative units re-contextualized since Grecian times. Snyder demonstrates a clear fluency in these concepts with his classically minded scripting, except he forgot the part where the archetypes are meant to be refreshed through novel contexts. On the humble farming planet of Wherever in the galaxy of Who Cares, the broad outline of a Hero (Sofia Boutella, terse and humorless and physically perfect, just how Snyder likes ’em) must defend her village from a faraway notion of an Evil Empire. They rose to power in some great cataclysm of yore during which our Hero’s family was killed, and the Final Boss took her in to teach her the combat skills she’d one day use to take her revenge. Snyder mistakes exposition for world-building, the lugubriously delivered reams of backstory removing the audience from the fantasy rather than immersing them in it.To topple the Mini-Boss (Ed Skrein, his British accent and high cheekbones marking him as a baddie) come to appropriate her people’s grain, she and her Sidekick (a neutered Michiel Huisman) bop around the cosmos rounding up sympathizers to their cause, including a self-interested yet caddishly likable mercenary we’ll call Not Han Solo (Charlie Hunnam, more visibly awake than most of his scene partners). They are most easily referred to by their function both because they exist as little more than sketches, and because the muddy sound mix isn’t doing viewers any favors, but especially because their names are often long and difficult to retain. Others are catchier, but never for good reasons. General Titus (Djimon Hounsou) and the squid-faced King Levitica offer arbitrary allusions for which the writing never makes any attempt to account. Some are just silly, like the brother-sister warriors surnamed Blood Axe, or Skrein’s effete colonist answering to Atticus Noble.Despite a few nifty creature designs, the handful of eccentricities never add up to a more colorful sense of personality; a fleshy parasite using its human host as a ventriloquist dummy hangs out in Snyder’s equivalent of the Mos Eisley cantina, but his wretched hive of scum and villainy has the clean interior decor and warm natural light of an upscale sushi restaurant. Even when sci-fi goes horribly awry, it usually yields some memorable weirdness, a tradeoff that’s endeared the likes of Jupiter Ascending or Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets to their self-selecting cults. No such luck in this case, with Snyder’s po-faced sensibility totally bereft of humor, intentional or otherwise. He envisioned the fight for Somewhere-or-Other as his masterpiece, its sprawling cumulative runtime and expansive scope unprecedented in his career. Going mad with power should be at the very least fun, exhilarating in the indulgence of an artist’s most outlandish whims. Instead, Snyder’s would-be magnum opus is merely boring.Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire is now out in select cinemas and will be on Netflix on 22 December"
Earth Mama review – Savanah Leaf’s outstanding debut about single motherhood,US rapper Tia Nomore excels as a woman facing an impossible situation in Leaf’s bleak yet defiant Bifa award-winning drama,4,"A San Francisco Bay Area single mother with two children who have already been sucked into the foster-care system, Gia (a revelatory performance from Oakland rapper Tia Nomore) is pregnant with her third child. Heavily so. Her belly seems cumbersome and incongruous on her slight frame. Brief fantasy interludes that cut into the naturalistic, almost documentary-style observational approach of this impressive feature debut suggest that Gia is deeply conflicted by her pregnancy and by the umbilical emotional connection that she already feels with the baby.It becomes clear that the unborn child in her belly is not the only weight that Gia carries. A hostile, punitive society seems designed to knock back poor Black women at every opportunity. Her weekly supervised meetings with her children are the happiest moments of her life – and the most painful. To regain custody, she must attend a rigorous schedule of drug rehabilitation classes and counselling sessions; she also has to pay child support. But to earn enough money, she needs more hours at work, something she can’t take on because of the time commitments of her state-mandated classes.It’s a supremely confident first feature from London-born, California-raised director Savanah Leaf, who won best debut director at the Bifas last week. Her storytelling is subtly understated but visually eloquent. Images, rather than words, are the currency in which Leaf trades, with particular emphasis on long, unbroken shots of Nomore’s endlessly expressive face as she wrestles with her impossible situation. It’s bleak at times, but there is a defiantly celebratory aspect to the film, which finds hope in the solidarity of Black women and dignity in Gia’s quiet stoicism."
The Archies review – Riverdale goes to India for goofy lessons in capitalism,"Relocated to north India in 1964, the comic-book class struggle here comes complete with romance and brilliant choreography",3,"One could be cynical and see this transposition of the Riverdale narrative universe into an Indian setting as just another exercise in brand colonialism, pasteurising youth culture one country at a time with deadly doses of emulsifying intellectual property. Or one could just chillax and dance along to the formidably catchy songs, performed with zip by the peppy and exceedingly well choreographed cast. While one is grooving along, it’s worth noting that every so often the film-makers have smuggled in a quietly subversive thought, such as in the song Everything Is Politics which argues, pace Marxist philosopher Louis Althusser, that there is no position outside the ideological apparatus. It’s that very dualism which makes this goofy musical fascinating, a guilt-free pleasure that’s nevertheless super-corny and ridiculous.Like the American Archie comics on which this is based, the story here takes place in a mythical town called Riverdale – except this Riverdale was founded in northern India by Anglo-Indians, as explained in an opening animated sequence. After independence, the residents of Riverdale planted trees in the names of their children to commemorate their newfound freedom and hope for the future, creating the municipal space Green Park in the centre of town. But, in the 1964 of the film, the now-teenage kids like rock’n’roll and miniskirts, they consider going abroad for university and are blithely unaware that things are changing in less savoury ways. Local oligarch Mr Lodge (Alyy Khan), father of high-school rich girl Veronica (Suhana Khan), has plans to develop the Green Park and plonk a grand hotel in the middle of it.This will affect the residents in different ways. For example, a landlord decides to close the bookshop where Hal (Satyajit Sharma), the father of Veronica’s best friend Betty (Khushi Kapoor), is the manager, putting Hal out of a job unless he accepts a position with a more profit-centric book chain. Meanwhile, teen heartthrob Archie Andrews (Agastya Nanda), clearly working on a sex and love addiction that will trouble him in later life, thinks his biggest problem in life is trying to decide whether he fancies Veronica or Betty more. The aforementioned songs explaining that Everything Is Politics put him right on that score, but the kids still have to gather enough signatures to overturn the city council’s decision to allow the rezoning of Green Park.That plot summary might make this sound much more like an episode of the darkish North American-set Archie-spinoff TV series Riverdale. But all of the above unfolds in a place that is very much recognisable as a version of rural India of the period: people speak a mashup of Hindi and English, older women wear saris, and Bollywood is the dominant cultural touchstone in the dance numbers, even when everyone is wearing rollerskates. The whole shebang is quite bizarre but sort of works, thanks to the brisk pacing of the editing and the joie de vivre that director Zoya Akhtar injects into the proceedings. The Archies is released on 7 December on Netflix"
"Tramps! review – the New Romantic story of freaks, Blitz kids and a ‘typhoon of death’",This nostalgic documentary tells the story of the scene that evolved from punk and was energised by London’s gay scene until it was ravaged by Aids,3,"Here’s a gossipy, nostalgic and really quite lovely documentary about the New Romantics, the scene best remembered for the flouncy shirts and extreme makeup, as told by some of the key players. The New Romantics (as they would never have dreamed of calling themselves) were arty kids in London in the late 70s and early 80s; the scene evolved out of punk, and was born on the dancefloor of the Blitz club in Covent Garden where Boy George worked as coat-check attendant (so he could steal out of coat pockets, apparently). The door policy was brutal – Mick Jagger got turned away. “But all the freaks got in for free.”And what freaks. This was the Thatcher era of grim recession and a lot of the “Blitz kids” lived in a squat in Warren Street in four of five Georgian houses knocked together. It was filthy but brilliant: you had to wear wellies to go to the loo, and most of the residents were on the dole. (“Who was going to give us jobs looking like that?”). But they were compulsively creative, making films, music, fashion, art. Clearly, a lot of time – a lot! – was spent dressing up, putting together DIY extravagant looks. A woman remembers travelling on the tube with her nipples painted red, wearing nothing but “a bit of muslin”. One drag queen carried concrete in her handbag for self-defence against homophobic attacks. The scene sounds like a sixth form, full of petty squabbling and rivalries; there’d be a fight on the dancefloor if someone stole your look.In hindsight there’s something quaint, endearing even, about the New Romantics mentality. They were desperate to be famous, but didn’t give a hoot about making money. Today, they’d all be influencers earning thousands of pounds from brands. Many went on to be leaders in their fields, including Boy George, choreographer Michael Clark and film-maker John Maybury. It’s Maybury who reminds director Kevin Hegge not to forget the queer influence. It’s often left out of documentaries, he says, because so many young gay men were lost to Aids – “a typhoon of death”. What a desperately sad ending.Tramps! is released on 11 December on digital platforms."
Joram review – old and new worlds collide in pressure cooker man and baby-hunt,Director Devashish Makhija slowly ramps up the tension with a sharp eye for oppressive realism and social satire as a father tries to out run his oppressors in this gritty thriller,4,"Where many thrillers programmatically crank up tension with every scene and every beat, Devashish Makhija’s third feature feels different; this manhunt is weighed down by an almost agonised oppressiveness. Joram’s protagonist Dasru (Manoj Bajpayee) is barely able to choose a course of action until compelled out of desperation, and his police pursuer Ratnakar (Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub) is not much better. There’s no escape in this pressure cooker from omnipresent societal exploitation and cynicism – with only Makhija’s compassion for the marginalised to compensate.A tattooed member of the “scheduled tribes” from the eastern state of Jharkhand, Dasru lives in exile as a Mumbai labourer. When Phulo Karma (Smita Tambe), a tribal leader from the same region, pitches up on his construction site electioneering, she recognises him from his former life: a jungle rebel fighting against the appropriation of local lands by her husband’s iron-ore mining outfit. Dasru is bewildered when he comes home to find his wife Vaano (Tannishtha Chatterjee) brutally murdered and trussed upside down, forcing him to flee into the streets with his three-month-old daughter Joram in a sling.Dasru makes a beeline for his Jharkhand heartland, with Ratnakar browbeaten into following. But the chase is all the more convincing because of how shambolic it is, with the setpieces seeming hapless and improvised. It amounts to a reduction of options, not a Hollywood-esque building climax, especially in a riveting sequence in a set of train corridors. Makhija shoots the urban clutter of half-built tower blocks and railway sidings with a jittery noirish lustre, and later loosens up into satire to burnish the theme of “progress” encroaching on rural life. The bent Jharkhand cops, in a region known for totemic tree worship, all keep their mobile phones in little cages attached to one.This downhill rolling tussle between the modern and the traditional always keeps an eye on a mythic horizon; for example, in the baleful sight of a tree with a terrible meaning as the only thing left standing in a blasted quarry. Tambe holds a formidable death stare as the vengeful magnate, and Ayyub is also good as the empathic Ratnakar. But Bajpayee, who broke out in the gritty 1998 gangster epic Satya, is made for clammy realism; largely mute, clasping his baby bundle, recoiling in panic as his eyes try to flee his head, he is like a refugee from Fritz Lang’s M. A plea on behalf of India’s dispossessed. Joram is released in cinemas on 8 December."
Eileen review – Anne Hathaway is magnetic in uneven neo-noir thriller,Director William Oldroyd follows Lady Macbeth with the tale of a woman dazzled by a glamorous colleague in small-town Massachusetts,3,"William Oldroyd’s follow-up to his superb feature debut, Lady Macbeth, Eileen is a 60s-set sapphic neo-noir that sees a gauche younger woman (Thomasin McKenzie) entranced by a sophisticated new co-worker (Anne Hathaway) at a Massachusetts young offenders facility. McKenzie plays Eileen as a girl who is upstaged by her own shapeless beige cardigan; it’s no wonder she’s fascinated by brassy blonde Rebecca, who matches her scarlet leather gloves to her sports car.And for a while at least, we fall under the same spell – against a world-weary bluesy score and an evocatively down-at-heel, small-minded, small-town backdrop, Rebecca is an impossibly exciting presence. Hathaway is magnetic, purring her way around the baked-in misogyny of the potato-faced local men. But then a third-act tonal shift knocks the whole film off balance. Rebecca remains impossibly glamorous, but she is no longer believable as a character."
Teddy’s Christmas review – wholesome kids’ feature is festive as Christmas cake,"Set in an indeterminate mid-century Norway, this animated tale of a talking teddy has some strange dubbing, but it’s wholesome fare",3,"As this Norwegian-made children’s feature begins, it’s coming up to Christmas time and tween Mariann (Marte Klerck-Nilssen) and her little brother (Vegard Strand Eide) are trimming the tree with extraordinary intra-sibling harmony. The era seems to be somewhere in the middle of the last century judging by the type of cars on the streets, the lack of semiconductor-driven toys and gadgets and, to an extent, the clothes – though Norwegians’ fondness for traditional dress, especially when it comes to loppisgenser or “flea” pattern sweaters and chunky wool toques, makes nailing the period a challenge.The important thing is that this unfolds in a utopian past full of good cheer, Christmas markets and magic that brings toys to be won at a spin-the-wheel stall to life, like the teddy bear of the title, which is dubbed into English with the voice of Zachary Levi. Mariann wins the teddy legitimately, but the furry scamp moves the wheel when no one is looking so that he has a chance to be won by an adult instead, who will take him to see the world. You see, he doesn’t understand how nice it is to be loved and cuddled by a child, although you can bet krone to kransekake he’ll learn about them by the end.Teddy has a “B” plot adventure as he is bought by an international man of mystery and meets a chatty plush hedgehog, while Mariann learns why breaking and entering is wrong, a life lesson surely all parents will get behind. Grandparents come to visit, little brother has an existential crisis over whether Santa is really his father, his actual dad (Jan Gunnar Røise) takes a bravura pratfall over the newly decorated Christmas tree, and mum (Mariann Hole, sporting a truly gorgeous teased-up tousled blond bob) manages not to burn the rice pudding. This one has all the Norwegian drama of Yuletide in one tidy package, yes sir.If you are not a child under the age of eight or nine, you may find yourself distracted by scrutinising how the film-makers have tried to disguise the disconnect between the actors speaking their original Norwegian and the requirement to dub into other languages. This means no one’s mouth is visible for too long, and if possible moustaches are deployed to disguise lip movements. Obviously, that doesn’t work so well between children and women, so they mug a lot for the camera in order to distract attention from their mouths. The animation, incidentally, is seamlessly executed and quite charming. Teddy’s Christmas is released on 1 December in UK and Irish cinemas."
Femme review – unbearably tense queer London revenge thriller,Nathan Stewart-Jarrett excels as a drag artist who starts a relationship with his attacker in Sam H Freeman and Ng Choon Ping’s unflinching feature debut,4,"Revenge is rarely a tidy business. But Femme, a savagely sexy queer erotic thriller, explores just how messily complex retribution can be. Set against a fretful, pulsing electronic score and unfolding in a world of sordid neons, it follows an east London drag artist who enters into a highly charged sexual relationship with his unwitting gay basher.Written and directed by first-time feature film-making duo Sam H Freeman and Ng Choon Ping, this is a teasing, slippery picture – a power-shifting tussle between out gay man Jules (Nathan Stewart-Jarrett, excellent) and his tightly wound closeted attacker Preston (George MacKay), neither of whom are quite who or what they say they are. Jules and Preston are both skilled in slipping into other skins and identities. Jules’s drag alter ego, Aphrodite, is fearless and fabulous. “She was the real me and I was the performance,” says Jules, mourning the loss of his bolder persona. After the street attack by Preston, Jules no longer feels able to perform. And Preston jealously guards his sexuality from his gang of friends, with their bared teeth, hyena laughs and pack mentality. It’s bold, unflinching and almost unbearably tense."
Tótem review – exquisite Mexican family drama of joy and heartbreak,"Writer-director Lila Avilés’s tender film, told largely through the eyes of a seven-year-old girl, is a minutely observed ensemble piece in which grief and celebration go hand in hand",5,"“When will the world end?” There’s a great deal of uncertainty in the life of seven-year-old Sol (Naíma Sentíes) right now, so she takes her mother’s phone to a quiet corner away from the bustle in her grandfather’s house and puts her big question to Siri. The little girl has picked up enough from the fragments of conversation of the adults thronging in the house to understand that, while the end is still a way off, her world, or at least part of it, is about to change for ever.The second film from Mexican actor turned writer-director Lila Avilés, Tótem is exquisite – a vital ensemble drama that’s suffused with joy and love. Taking a child’s-eye view of the controlled chaos of preparations for a birthday party in honour of Sol’s terminally ill father, Tonatiuh (Mateo García Elizondo), it deftly balances grief against celebration; the shadow of death against a frame that is perpetually teeming with life (human, insect, animal and a goldfish named Nugget).It’s a picture that cements Avilés as one of the brightest talents in a new wave of female Mexican directors – a movement that also includes Tatiana Huezo (Prayers for the Stolen), Fernanda Valadez (Identifying Features) and Issa López (Tigers Are Not Afraid). Tótem also represents a marked step up in terms of ambition and scope. Avilés’s widely acclaimed debut, The Chambermaid (2019), was a contained, subdued character study that followed the daily routine of a maid in a high-end luxury hotel in Mexico City. Like the diligent, quiet woman at its centre, it was hyper-observant, unusually tuned in to tiny details.Tótem shares an instinctive, naturalistic approach with The Chambermaid but is more exuberant and intuitive, a free-flowing, multifaceted portrait of an extended family. The meticulous, minute details are still there, and the camera is attuned to them, but there’s something more satisfyingly complex at play here – a harmony of energies (and occasional moments of discord) that depicts the family both as individuals and as a single entity, a living, breathing creature. Avilés cites the work of John Cassavetes as an influence and describes the picture as a “choral” film. It’s a term that perfectly captures the minor key tenderness and attentiveness of Tótem’s embrace.Grief hits everyone differently. Sol’s aunt, Tonatiuh’s sister Nuria (Montserrat Marañon), shaved off her hair in solidarity with her brother after his cancer diagnosis, only to note, wryly, that he has managed to keep his flowing locks intact. Nuria numbs her pain with several bottles of wine and channels her love into a birthday cake, painted in the style of Van Gogh and fine-tuned obsessively in the kitchen while the party is in full swing in the garden. Finishing it, you sense, is a step that Nuria is unwilling to take, symbolic of severing yet another link with her brother.Meanwhile, her sister, Ale (Marisol Gasé), pays for a grifter spiritualist to rid the house of negative energy (“I also sell Tupperware,” says the opportunistic medium, having price-gouged Ale on the cost of an exorcism). Sol’s grandfather (Alberto Amador) gives his son the gift of a bonsai tree that he has cultivated for the past seven years. We see in Tonatiuh’s anguished smile of thanks that the tree is certain to outlive him. And in a heartbreakingly poignant scene, Sol and her actor mother, Lucía (Iazua Larios), put on a clown-wigged comedy performance in honour of the occasion.There is no score, only the party playlist the characters hear. But Avilés finds music in the rhythms of the conversations, in particular the shorthand exchanges and in-jokes between family members who know each other inside out. In this aspect, I suspect that non-Spanish speakers relying on the subtitles – myself included – may be missing out on some of the subtleties of Avilés’s screenplay. But the film’s visual language is universal. Lithe, long takes weave between the legs of adults and turn the furniture into a playground. There’s a wayward sense of adventure in the way the camera moves within the walls of the house, reflecting a seven-year-old’s curiosity and quest for discovery. And the lyrical, recurring motif of animals and insects – a device also used in another film about terminal disease, Shannon Murphy’s Babyteeth (2019) – gives a sense of continuity and connection with the wider natural world, and an acceptance of the beauty and inevitability of cycles of life and death."
It’s a Wonderful Knife review – seasonal classic refitted as comedy slasher horror ,A good cast can’t lift this not-quite-convincing retake on It’s a Wonderful Life as a teen frightfest ,2,"Here is a classic example of a film you root for, fervently willing it to be brilliant. It’s got Joel McHale from Community in it – great. It’s got Justin Long committing to a bit as a Trump-style property baron with blond hair and spray tan – fabulous. Even more exciting: there’s a role for Katharine Isabelle, star of beloved turn-of-the-century horror comedy Ginger Snaps, as a cool lesbian aunt.The premise is fun, too: a loose remake of It’s a Wonderful Life as a comedy-horror about a teenage girl called Winnie Carruthers (Jane Widdop), whose life goes to hell after she kills a masked maniac. This leads her to wish she had never been born – a wish then somehow granted by the cosmos. In turn, this gives said masked maniac a free hand to establish a reign of terror over the little town of Angel Falls.But sometimes you can have all the right ingredients and the recipe doesn’t quite pan out as you’d hoped. It’s a Wonderful Knife is diverting enough to start with, as the plot clicks efficiently into motion with the requisite stabbings and impalings. Unfortunately, there’s not enough fuel in the engine – the characters don’t have quite enough to do, we can’t care quite enough about them, and the world-building is nearly-but-not-quite convincing.Some of the comedy-horror tropes employed here call to mind the likes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer – which in fact did something similar in the episode The Wish, which imagined the titular slayer never came to the vampire-ridden town of Sunnydale. But TV enjoys an advantage over film in at least one respect: the runtime of a single episode, on average, doesn’t need as much sustenance as a feature film, and what works very well at 40 minutes just feels stretched out at 90. It’s a Wonderful Knife is released on 1 December on Shudder."
Pictures of Ghosts review – Brazilian auteur haunted by his home town’s decline,"Kleber Mendonça Filho offers a poetic but somewhat unfocused memoir-essay about place, cinema and time",3,"Home is clearly where the art is for Bacurau director Kleber Mendonça Filho, whose childhood apartment is the locus of the first part of this poetic but somewhat bemused memoir-essay about place, cinema and time. Twice renovated by his historian mother, the apartment was the site of his first early imaginative forays behind the camera, and appeared in his first two features, Neighbouring Sounds from 2012 and, four years later, Aquarius. Mendonça’s native city of Recife has also been subject to similar remodellings, as shown in the second and third parts here, through the decline of its cinema houses. As they fall into dereliction, it feels like a form of collective dementia, robbing its citizens of a shared cultural continuity.In Neighbouring Sounds, Mendonça has an almost diagrammatic way of shooting his street and continues in the same vein here. Interweaving his family’s history with home-video excerpts and his later feature-film deployments, it’s as if he is trying to fix the essence of the place. Nico, the long-deceased dog next door, is resurrected thanks to clips from Mendonça’s debut, in which his incessant barking became part of the plot. Art can be an act of resurrection – or an exhumation: a bleary inexplicable phantom figure appears in a negative of the director’s living room, though it is not his mother who died aged 54 of cancer. The director’s sleepy voice sifts this flotsam of art and life. “It may seem like I’m talking about methodology, but I’m talking about love.”Mendonça’s hauntological mission then spills out into downtown Recife, in search of more ghosts. Now-bare cinema marquees, glimpsed in old photos, are time-stamps for the city. He was educated in these places; we see him talking, in more archive footage, to “Mr Alexandre”, the projectionist at the Art Palacio cinema who talks about locking it up on its final night “with a key of tears”. As well as the director’s own past, these now-decrepit buildings are repositories of the country’s cultural history: the Art Palacio, for example, was once earmarked as an outlet for UFA, the Nazi propaganda cinema arm seeking to tighten its grip on the sympathetic Brazilian regime.The film’s third part focuses on cinema as a site of worship: literally, in the case of several auditoriums later converted into evangelical churches. Mendonça is hardly the first to make the comparison and, with the relationship between cinema and religion in Brazil only cursorily sketched here, it is a pat concluding note. The old cinema faith isn’t likely to see a resurrection in Recife, with the city’s dynamism (and presumably the multiplexes) having migrated to other districts, and digital distribution now coordinated from São Paulo. Which leaves Mendonça and his film alone inside cinema’s decaying ships – to use another of his metaphors – with uncertain bearings in the fogbanks of memory. Pictures of Ghosts is released on 1 December at the ICA, London."
Battle Over Britain review – Spitfires duke it out in derring-do war drama,A squadron of fighter pilots is depicted over 24 hours in 1940 in Callum Burn’s stripped-down-to-the-rivets tale,3,"This unabashedly retro war story, set over 24 hours in August 1940, strips the action down to the rivets with a small cast and a handful of locations, including the cockpits of several Spitfire planes (or perhaps one plane used to stand in for several). You’d think it might have cost no more than a tin of biscuits and few packets of tea to make – except that the aerial photography, never a cheap component, looks authentic and presumably special effects were required to create the dogfights in which our heroic fly-boys duke it out in the skies against the Luftwaffe.Directed by Callum Burn and co-written by him and his father Andrew, it’s of a piece with the previous features from their Lincolnshire production company Tin Hat, specialists in second world war tales of heroism and aerial derring-do. Given the numbers of actual veterans and survivors of the conflict are swiftly dwindling now, you have to wonder how much interest is out there to make this tiny niche in film production profitable. Presumably, there are enough people who yearn for a simpler time when men were men, women wore boilersuits and everyone was pretty much united in one virtuous common cause.The slightly dodgy figure here is Nathan Walker (Vin Hawke, good even if the haircut is more 2020s footballer than 1940s pilot), who is obsessed with winning the betting pool on who can shoot down the most Jerries. His cynicism puts him at odds with his fellow pilots, especially Cochrane (Tom Gordon) and wistful Cooper (Micky David) who wants to survive long enough to marry his sweetheart Nancy (Hannah Harris, rocking the aforementioned boilersuit). In between missions up in the air fighting the enemy, the men relax at the dispatch hut near the runway and banter. The ringing of the telephone becomes a frequent augur of death: after each sortie someone won’t come back, or might land just in time to die accompanied by some sentimental music.One’s lip would have to be stiff as postwar Festival of Britain-era concrete not to find such sacrifices at least a tiny bit moving – at least the first few times, but it does get a bit monotonous. Still, plaudits to the Tin Hat team for keeping the home fires burning for those who served. Battle Over Britain is released on 1 December in UK cinemas."
Disorder review – sympathetic study of three military veterans living with PTSD,Kate Blewett’s documentary shows the lasting effects of war and considers the way that three ex-soldiers look to cope with their traumas,3,"Interviewed for this documentary about veterans living with post-traumatic stress disorder, war photographer Lalage Snow talks about her series of triptych portraits of soldiers: three photos, taken before, during and after deployment in Afghanistan. You find yourself searching for the psychological scars written in their tired, thinner faces. In some of the “after” shots, it’s as if war has completely rewired them. Their features look subtly but noticeably different, muscles in their faces clenched, hardening their expressions – or somehow making them softer. It’s extraordinary work.Snow says she always wanted to go back, photograph the soldiers a decade after the war, but hasn’t been able to get funding. Instead she talks here in Kate Blewett’s straightforward sympathetic documentary following three veterans living with PTSD (none of them featured in Snow’s work as far we know). One of them is Amber, who enlisted at age 16 after a childhood of domestic violence and sexual abuse. Her emotional rawness and vulnerability are very brave, but almost unbearable to watch in places. Former Royal Marine sniper Stuart is on his second attempt at rowing solo across the Atlantic. He wants to prove that PTSD doesn’t have to hold you back. It’s also a kind of therapy, he says, “To keep my demons at bay.” Blewett gently asks him how it changed him, being a sniper. He won’t be prodded. “It’s a job, you get paid to do it.” Which leaves you wondering if there is trauma he doesn’t want to go near.We also meet a former US marine called Ryan, now serving with Vetpaw, a group of veterans protecting wildlife in Africa. People assume they are a bunch of gung-ho, trigger-happy bros, but Ryan says that they’ve all seen enough death to last a lifetime. What Vetpaw gives him back is the “brotherhood” he had in the marines. Back home in the US he was sick of the pity and questions. “I don’t want to reintegrate into society. Society sucks.” Disorder is released on 28 November on digital platforms."
My Father’s Secrets review – Holocaust pain unlocked in Jewish coming-of-age tale,"Animated feature, based on Michel Kichka’s autobiographical graphic novel, explores the legacy of genocide from a sideways angle",3,"Adapted from Second Generation, an autobiographical graphic novel (perhaps the genre should be termed “autobiographic novel”?) by Michel Kichka, this animated feature explores the legacy of the Holocaust from a somewhat sideways angle. Kichka’s father Henri was a survivor of Auschwitz, but when the story starts in the late 1950s-early 1960s, Henri is a tamped-down, closed-off character who keeps the office, like his memories, locked up and unshared with his five children. In a pastel-coloured Belgian town, Michel is first met as an adolescent, voiced by Ilan Galkoff although narration by the older Michel (David Baddiel) comments on the action throughout. Barely aware of what happened during the war except that it was something bad dad doesn’t talk about, Michel and younger brother Charley (Skye Bennett) go to synagogue with their family but don’t much think about their Jewish identity except when it gets the young boys out of religious education classes.However, when the 1960 trial of Adolf Eichmann is televised and becomes essential viewing for all the Jewish families in the neighbourhood, Michel and Charley start to take more interest in their father’s story. Somewhat confusingly, he refuses to talk about it with his kids because it is too painful, but out of a sense of duty he becomes a noted speaker on the subject of the Holocaust, appearing on television and guiding visitors around the camps. Meanwhile, Michel becomes more aware of subtle and overt acts of antisemitism all around him, from the teasing of schoolmates to a girlfriend’s father who throws cold water on him when he comes a-courting specifically because he’s Jewish.With its 12 certificate and very simplified graphic style, this feels like it’s intended partly as a pedagogic instrument for kids the same age as those in the film, and inspiration for Holocaust 101 discussions. But it’s still also a story about specific people with their particular family dynamics and unique sufferings, so be prepared for a tragic turn of events towards the end, one that has nothing to do with the larger tragedy that is the Holocaust. It may upset younger viewers but it also makes this film a bit more interesting than the usual baby-boomer-generation, young-Jewish-guy’s coming-of-age story that it looks like on the surface. My Father’s Secrets is released on 27 November on digital platforms."
Leo review – Adam Sandler is a wise lizard in charming Netflix comedy,An animated semi-musical sees the comedy star take on the role of agony uncle for struggling kids in a sweet if a little disjointed tale,3,"Earlier this year, Adam Sandler’s high-volume, low-quality Netflix deal gifted us with the surprisingly sensitive coming-of-age comedy You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah, a rare critical win for his company, Happy Madison. It might not have reached the heights of the year’s other big pre-teen adaptation Are You There God, It’s Me Margaret? but it was sweeter and subtler than most expected and became his best-reviewed film to date on Rotten Tomatoes, an interesting use of his sway at the streamer.It might have been focused on middle schoolers but it represented a maturity absent from so many of Sandler’s tiresome films on Netflix, a platform he initially collaborated with because it rhymes with “Wet Chicks”. His latest Leo sits comfortably alongside, another classroom-based comedy for an even younger audience, and while Sandler plays a bigger role this time, from dad in the background to protagonist in the fore, we see even less of him on screen. That’s because Leo is an animated lizard, voiced by Sandler, (his second cartoon outing after 2002’s loathed Eight Crazy Nights) a school pet dealing with his own mortality.After Leo starts to worry that at 74, he might be nearing the end, he decides to hatch an escape plan so that he can finally see the world outside of a tank, which he shares with a turtle, voiced by Bill Burr. But when Leo sees a way out, scuttling away during a weekend being looked after by one of the students, he finds himself becoming an unlikely agony uncle instead. Each of the kids he proceeds to stay with needs him in some different way and Leo starts to realise that it might be more important for him to stay rather than go.As Leo, Sandler makes the slightly ill-advised decision to “do a voice”, something he last did in 2020’s Hubie Halloween, adding an unnecessary, annoying-dad-telling-a-bedtime-story silliness to what’s ultimately a rather earnest little movie. The kids that Leo takes time to counsel have issues varying from an inability to ask questions to being oversensitive to masking anxiety and it’s in these deft two-hander vignettes that the film is most successful, Sandler’s co-written script choosing to take specific problems seriously, life lessons told without a side order of fart jokes. Some of the embellishments surrounding these moments are less successful, the film often unsure how to turn the central conceit into a full story.It’s a sort of musical with a string of half-numbers that range from lazily tossed off to charmingly committed, all of which stop before they really even get started. The last act is a bit of a jumble with a late-stage antagonist and an inevitable quest, a disjointed scramble, but one that climaxes in a worthy reminder for kids to share their problems rather than bottling them up, a not exactly groundbreaking endnote but one that’s expressed genuinely enough for it to register.Brightly animated and with moments of surprising insight, there’s a warm likability to Leo that radiates, for those still in the classroom and those who left it long ago.Leo is now available on Netflix"
Genie review – seasonal Richard Curtis comedy can’t save Christmas for anyone,This bafflingly bland offering wastes the talents of Melissa McCarthy and Paapa Essiedu – it’s as if they removed the laughs in case they offend ,1,"Screenwriter Richard Curtis is a cinema colossus with nothing left to prove: he reinvented the romcom with transatlantic classics like Four Weddings, Notting Hill and The Tall Guy; he re-energised charitable giving with Comic Relief; and even those of us who never signed up to Love Actually concede the dark power of the Emma Thompson-crying scene. But we really do not need this new Christmas film from him (he writes, Sam Boyd directs), an unremittingly awful, bafflingly terrible and defanged bit of seasonal gibberish: a fantasy comedy which forgets to put in gags and which cheats its own narrative rules. Watching it is like trailing around a year-round Christmas market in March.Paapa Essiedu plays a chap with the quirky name of Bernard Bottle, employed in New York (cue Christmassy shots of people skating in Rockefeller Plaza) as an assistant in a very posh art auction house, run by a heartless meanie called Flaxman (Alan Cumming). Flaxman declines to let poor Bernard go home at knocking-off time to attend his daughter’s birthday – very close to Christmas incidentally – and loads more work on him. Bernard timidly submits.But Bernard is not exactly a Bob Cratchit figure and he certainly doesn’t have Cratchit’s money worries. He, wife Julie (Denée Benton) and daughter Eve (Jordyn McIntosh) live in a handsome New York apartment and Julie’s family is apparently loaded. But Julie is furious with him for missing Eve’s birthday, and she takes their daughter and leaves. Poor Bernard miserably looks at the dusty old jewellery box that he’s had for ages (and which he unconvincingly tried to give Eve as a last-minute present), idly polishes it and – whoosh! – a wacky genie comes out, played by Melissa McCarthy.This genie can grant any number of wishes, but she has to hear the instructions clearly; she can’t change people’s basic feelings and she can’t take you back in time. So … can she pull off the Christmas miracle of saving Bernard’s marriage? Well, no one minds a bit of predictable cheesiness, but McCarthy is just so completely subdued in this film and is never allowed to let rip. It’s as if everyone involved is terrified of actually making people laugh in case that gives offence somehow, or disrupts the algorithmic calculation that theoretically makes this a palatable piece of content. The whole thing is as bland as cellophane. Genie is released on 22 November on Peacock in the US and on 1 December on Sky Cinema and Now in the UK."
Ronnie O’Sullivan: The Edge of Everything review – snooker legend unpicks the game he loves and loathes,"The green baize artist comes across as an all-round nice bloke as he amicably and candidly reveals his struggles with mental health, addiction and M&S scones",3,"It’s the final of the 2022 World Snooker Championships, and a TV pundit is showering compliments on Ronnie O’Sullivan, who’s back in his stride after losing a couple of frames to Judd Trump. “He just looks so relaxed, so cool,” marvels the pundit. Behind the scenes, we’ve just watched O’Sullivan nervy, on the edge of a meltdown, and venting at his psychiatrist, Prof Steve Peters. “Fuck me, I feel bashed up Steve,” he says. It’s one of the biggest games of O’Sullivan’s career; if he wins, he’ll have seven world crowns – equalling Stephen Hendry’s modern-era record. At 46, who knows how many finals he’s got left in him? As history records, O’Sullivan did get past Trump, by 18 frames to 13.If you’re watching this entertaining documentary utterly unbothered about whether or not he is snooker’s greatest player (“he’s an artist” says Hendry), the good news is that O’Sullivan is brilliant company. He’s got the gift of the gab, a sense of humour and he’s relaxed with his vulnerability: talkative about his addictions and mental health struggles. Nattering away to director Sam Blair, he comes over as an all-round nice bloke. Significantly, perhaps, the film is exec produced by another Essex boy, David Beckham.O’Sullivan says he fell in love with snooker early. He had bundles of talent and was pushed to be a champion by his larger-than-life dad Ronnie Senior. “I needed that, or I would have been a loser,” says O’Sullivan. In 1992, the year he turned professional, Ronnie Senior was jailed for murder. In his 20s, O’Sullivan spiralled into drug addiction; his old mate Damien Hirst remembers getting a call to take him to the Priory. Nowadays, O’Sullivan’s fix is a good scone with clotted cream: “It’s got to be M&S.”I’m not sure a two-hour film is long enough to unpick his tortured relationship with snooker (he’s been with psychiatrist Peters for 10 years). As a young player there were moments when he felt invincible. He’s still chasing that high. The healthiest thing would be to give up, O’Sullivan reflects. “But I’ve found a way of it not killing me.” Ronnie O’Sullivan: The Edge of Everything is released on 23 November on Prime Video, and on 24 November in UK and Irish cinemas."
Best. Christmas. Ever! review – Netflix comedy might be worst of the season,"Brandy and Heather Graham play old friends reunited in an awful, mercifully short, film that offers zero Christmas cheer",1,"It’s the junkiest time of the year for streamers, churning out cheap Christmas films that are so tinnily made and carelessly written that enduring them requires more seasonal spirit than even Buddy the Elf could even muster. Will Ferrell’s comedy turns 20 this year, along with Love Actually and Bad Santa, and all recall an unusually magic time for the festive film, each in their different ways earning an easy rewatch slot when November kicks in.It’s obviously, stupidly unfair to compare any of Netflix’s many many low-stakes films of the season to those beloved standouts, but while Best. Christmas. Ever! was never intended to be quite as good, it really doesn’t need to be quite this bad. Shoddy seasonal slop had been previously siloed on Hallmark and Lifetime channels, for those who had become accustomed to reduced standards all year round, but Netflix has enthusiastically got in on the game too, and while its brand has lost considerable lustre in recent years, it’s still the same platform that attracts small and big screen auteurs with a vision. Nestled next to the new David Fincher, again expectations would not be as high for a comedy headlined by Heather Graham, but it’s easy to forget throughout the rest of the year just how lackadaisical and low-rent these films can be, lofty comparison or no, from script to direction to performances. Arguably the most important role in these films is set dresser, jamming every scene with enough decorations to distract from the listlessness elsewhere, but no amount of tinsel can disguise how boringly tossed off this one is, a bleak reminder of what’s in store for the next six weeks.At less than 80 minutes, it’s barely even a movie, more one long montage of bits that never run on long enough to be defined as scenes. Strange given that the film boasts a more interesting pedigree than usual with a script co-written by Charles Shyer, whose words helped to define studio comedies for a while with Private Benjamin, Father of the Bride, Baby Boom and The Parent Trap. Any of that wit or even basic competency is nowhere to be seen here, aimlessly telling the story of two old friends who are reunited during the holidays.One is a tireless success story (Brandy Norwood) and the other is a self-defined failure (Graham), the former’s braggy Christmas newsletters causing the latter to feel inadequate as well as suspicious. When an absurd set of circumstances forces them to spend Christmas together, their rivalry comes to a head.It’s a premise that suggests something as salty as it is sweet but the film, directed by Pet Sematary’s Mary Lambert, is as wet as a pile of melting snow, refusing to indulge in any fun cattiness, transforming the pitch for a dark comedy into a sickly family movie, overstuffed with inane life lessons and cloying kids. Something with more of a bite would have allowed our two leads to have a bit more fun but they’re both stuck in sleepwalk mode, a particularly bored Graham struggling to add a much-needed lightness to her comedic scenes. It’s so unclear as to what kind of friendship these two once had (they barely share any scenes alone together) and instead of filling in any of the gaps, the script lazily tries to create vague conflict out of romantic jealousy instead, involving their husbands (including Jason Biggs, lost) when the film should have focused more tightly on the women.In the last act, the absurd details of the plot become so deranged that the film almost hobbles into so-bad-it’s-good territory with the pair heading for disaster on an out-of-control solar-powered hot air balloon that could be saved by Graham’s underused skills as a failed inventor, whose main flop idea was “chip mitts” that protect hands from Cheetos dust. But it’s too insane too late and not insane enough to forgive the flatness that’s come before.It might be the year’s first Netflix Christmas film to come barreling out of the production line but it’s hard to imagine it getting any worse.Sign up to The GuideGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every Fridayafter newsletter promotionBest.

The Lost Weekend: A Love Story review – vivid snapshot of Lennon’s dysfunctional liaison ,"Documentary about May Pang, the woman with whom John Lennon had an affair during his marriage to Yoko Ono, reveals that Ono was pulling the strings",4,"As Yoko Ono enters her 90s, it is perhaps a tactless time to release a documentary about the woman with whom John Lennon had a love affair during a rough patch in his marriage from about 1973 to 1975, what he ungallantly called his “lost weekend”. This is the couple’s then assistant, the extremely smart Chinese-American May Pang, in her early 20s at the time, who emerges with grace and dignity from this engrossing film. The Apple Records A&R man and LA music eminence grise Tony King is quoted here saying of Pang: “She wasn’t just a little scrubber …” That Withnailesque phrase hardly does justice to an intelligent, beautiful and sweet-natured woman who gave unquestioning love to Lennon and appeared to single-handedly repair his relationship with his son Julian.It seems to have been a real love match, but founded on a strange, dysfunctional situation: Ono herself, by her own cautious admission, encouraged the liaison as a way of managing and controlling what she saw as Lennon’s increasing tendency to stray. Ono virtually ordered Pang to “date” Lennon and the resulting semi-official coupledom coincided with a poignant flowering of creativity and relaxation in Lennon’s life, both in LA where he and Pang briefly hung out, and back in New York. But Ono was always there in the background, perhaps in more direct contact with Lennon than Pang quite realised or this film acknowledges.Finally, it was Ono herself who called time on the liaison and Lennon sheepishly informed the heartbroken May that he was going back to live with Ono in their home in the Dakota building, outside which he would five years later meet his terrible fate. This documentary fortunately refrains from making glib comparisons between Ono breaking up this affair to the way some saw her as breaking up the Beatles, but the film (based on Pang’s two previous books on the subject, and using the resulting TV interview footage) is implicitly critical of both Ono and Lennon and their self-absorption. A sterner commentary might have called their attitude abusive. At all events, it is a vivid snapshot of a troubled private life at the apex of the US music scene. The Lost Weekend: A Love Story is released on 20 November on the Icon Film Channel and on 18 December on DVD, Blu-ray and digital platforms."
Thanksgiving review – Eli Roth’s fun slasher is far from a turkey,A jokey 2007 trailer gets expanded into an entertainingly gory full-length horror about a killer dressed as a pilgrim wreaking havoc in a small town,4,"Eli Roth has long worked to collapse the distance between cinema’s mainstream and its grungiest fringes, smuggling determinedly low-rent genres – mostly splatter horror, the odd shameless erotic thriller, the globetrotting safari of third-world depravity known as the mondo film – into your neighborhood multiplex. He did so most literally with his contribution to Grindhouse, a 2007 double feature from the sleaze connoisseurs Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez styled to evoke the gutbucket treasures of yore, complete with faux-retro scratches and interstitial trailers for nonexistent coming attractions. Roth directed one such short, a spot for a Z-grade slasher that loosed a killer in a pilgrim get-up on the town of Plymouth to slice up their annual Turkey Day parade. “White meat. Dark meat. All will be carved,” went the tagline’s warning, the voiceover basted with an affectionate irony.In fully realizing his gravy-drenched gorefest Thanksgiving, Roth tempts fate by expanding a joke perfectly portioned at two minutes to feature length, which got old sooner rather than later when tried on fellow Grindhouse alumni Machete and Hobo with a Shotgun. He does away with the throwback aesthetics, a visual tidying-up that matches the image quality to its present-day setting of Instagram live streams and land acknowledgments. And within an amply earned R rating, a couple of concessions needed to be made; a vaginal impalement from the original trailer has been relocated to a more tasteful part of the body, and an immaculately roasted nude human corpse with stuffing bursting from its pelvic cavity now wears clothes. But Roth has nonetheless held fast to the demented playfulness of classic exploitation in a stick-to-your-ribs feast of ascended schlock. Never mind all the talk of poultry, he’s dishing up red goddamned meat: prime-certified laughs and mutilations, no fillers or additives.Surely to the great frustration of the many DIY deviants following his example, there’s no substitute for Roth’s nuts-and-bolts skill as an orchestrator of tension and humor, which lays a finely honed foundation for his wicked games. In the exhilarating prologue, a coiled sense of foreboding tightens and explodes as a stampede of Black Friday shoppers storm a Walmart knockoff and claim three lives in the chaos. A clever inversion of Dawn of the Dead’s mall invasion recasting the zombies as consumers, it’s an unsubtle yet chillingly plausible remark on our grotesque capitalist distortion of a holiday that, as one teacher points out, began with America’s genocidal original sin. Roth shoots the crowd like the rabid rioters that form after Bostonians win or lose a major sporting event – among its plentiful virtues, this is one of the finest and truest films ever made about the people of Massachusetts – but lingers on a “Doorbuster Sale” sign as a reminder that businesses stoke and profit from such behavior. Roth reduced human lives to dollars and cents with the soulless auctions of the second Hostel film; here, they’re 50% off, as declared by a banner forming a delectably morbid pun with a woman’s bisected carcass.Roth thinks in hooks and punchlines, which keeps the copious slayings inventive and gratifying while also enlivening the connective tissue between them. One year after the massacre, the buckle-hatted maniac – hidden behind a mask of the Plymouth colony governor John Carver like a seasonal kitsch Michael Myers – starts picking off those visible in a viral recording taken that night, targeting the store owner’s teen daughter Jessica (Nell Verlaque) and her buddies (most notable among them the social media personality Addison Rae, a gen Z “Paris Hilton in House of Wax” without the grisly payoff). Despite the valiant efforts of the town sheriff (the Maine native Patrick Dempsey, dropping his Rs like so many lobster traps into the icy Atlantic), one local after the next becomes part of the ghastly place-setting at a dinner where the menu includes decapitation, disembowelment and forced cannibalism. As with any good meal, timing is everything, and there’s no lollygagging or self-serious ponderousness to forestall the fun. Even a tacked-on subplot concerning two boys dueling for Jessica’s affections has the decency to poke fun at its own extraneousness.The table’s tableau echoes The Texas Chain Saw Massacre’s previous perversion of wholesome Rockwelliana, its emphasis on family and togetherness turned incestuous and rageful. Roth’s reference points aren’t particularly obscure, but he earns the right to claim them through his proud commitment to horror for horror’s sake, a balm at a time when it feels like every other entry to the genre is buckling beneath the weight of its belabored trauma metaphors. He applies discipline to the disreputable, elevating choice cuts of trash not with put-on profundity but with a keener mastery of and appreciation for their foulest, basest pleasures. What more do we need to give thanks for?Thanksgiving is out in UK and US cinemas on 17 November"
Mafia Mamma review – Toni Collette sells wacky empty-nester mob comedy hard,Unfortunately even her talents cannot save perfunctory tale of a discontented American woman who inherits an Italian crime family,2,"Not even the fierce wattage of Toni Collette’s talent can light up this hokey crime comedy, a kind of wacky mobster spin on the idea of the unhappy American woman finding herself and learning to love again in a luxury Euro-tourist paradise; Mafia Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again, perhaps. It’s directed by Catherine Hardwicke from a story idea by French author and film-maker Amanda Sthers, who gave us Madame – another film into which Collette tried valiantly but unsuccessfully to breathe some life.Here she plays Kristin, an empty-nester whose son has just gone away to college; she is bored and unfulfilled by her job as a big pharma PR, and her husband turns out to be a cheating slimeball. Then she receives news that her Italian grandfather has just died on his Lazio estate bequeathing her full control of his “winery” business. Intrigued and in need of a change of scene, Kristin hops on the next flight to Italy and even at the airport has a flirtatious encounter with a hunky pasta-maker called Lorenzo (Guilio Corso). But when a shootout breaks out at her grandfather’s funeral, Kristin learns the awful truth: she has inherited a crime family.Collette’s gift for comedy is always welcome and she sells this movie very hard, like the impeccable professional she is, and it’s a nice enough premise for an undemanding comedy. But frankly Collette is let down by Monica Bellucci’s very torpid and disengaged performance as her late grandfather’s mysterious private secretary, and the woman who looks as if she has been the one really pulling the strings. Bellucci looks as if she is thinking about something else in every scene. It isn’t long before you’re doing the same. Mafia Mamma is released on 17 November on Prime Video."
The Eternal Memory review – a profoundly moving portrait of love and Alzheimer’s,Chilean journalist Augusto Góngora and actor-politician Paulina Urrutia navigate his memory loss with warmth and tenderness in this wrenchingly sad documentary,4,"The framework of a marriage – the shared past, the certainties, even the love itself – is put under unimaginable strain when one half of it, former journalist and broadcaster Augusto Góngora, is diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. This tender, profoundly moving Chilean documentary is an intimate study of the strategies that Góngora and his wife, the actor and politician Paulina Urrutia, put in place to cope with the attrition of his memories. With warmth and patience, Paulina painstakingly walks her husband through the increasingly tangled mental maze of his past, signposting key moments and facts for him to cling to: his achievements as a reporter; his wide circle of friends and family (“They love me very much,” he repeats like a mantra, in an attempt to stave off the clouds of confusion).The latest film from Chilean director Maite Alberdi (Oscar-nominated for her previous documentary, The Mole Agent), The Eternal Memory is a restrained, respectful piece of film-making that takes its lead from its two subjects. It’s wrenchingly sad, but also a testament to the love that endures, even as Augusto increasingly struggles to recognise his wife."
Anatomy of a Fall review – electric Palme d’Or-winning courtroom thriller,A tantalising screenplay keeps the audience guessing in Justine Triet’s gripping French drama in which superb lead actor Sandra Hüller plays a woman suspected of her husband’s murder,4,"To fully understand a marriage you need to be a part of it. And even then it can seem as if the two partners are communicating in entirely different languages. This is literally the case in the marriage of successful German-born author Sandra (a phenomenal Sandra Hüller) and her French husband, aspiring writer Samuel (Samuel Theis), a union that is forensically and microscopically examined in Justine Triet’s gripping, sinuous, Cannes Palme d’Or-winning courtroom drama Anatomy of a Fall. Language – Sandra prefers to speak in English even though, at her husband’s behest, they live in France – is just one of the flashpoints for tension between the two.These tensions might have just simmered on privately and indefinitely, within the walls of the couple’s partially renovated alpine chalet, but for the fact that Samuel is found dead, discovered by the couple’s visually impaired 11-year-old son, Daniel (a terrific, painfully conflicted turn from talented young actor Milo Machado Graner), having fallen from the attic window. An inconclusive inquest into the death can’t rule out the possibility that he was pushed. And so Sandra finds herself on trial, with her child called as one of the key witnesses in the case. The flaws and faultlines in her relationship with Samuel are exposed and picked over by a tenacious prosecution lawyer (Antoine Reinartz) and repackaged as evidence for her guilt.Perhaps more than most genres, the courtroom drama succeeds or fails on the strength of its screenplay. And here, with its layered and rewardingly intricate script co-written by Triet and her husband, Arthur Harari, this solid, unshowy film excels. Nodding to courtroom dramas such as Kramer vs Kramer and Otto Preminger’s Anatomy of a Murder (an inspiration in more than just title), and to the more recent example of Alice Diop’s compelling Saint Omer, it’s a slippery thing, a teasingly complex framework that repeatedly tips the audience off balance and taps into our biases and assumptions.A genre that can be prone to stuffiness and overly waffly dialogue, the courtroom drama here is electric, restlessly dynamic and compulsively watchable, with only a few rare moments in which the film’s throttling hold on the audience loosens. It’s a considerable step up for Triet, whose previous work includes the frothy, more overtly comic In Bed With Victoria and the uneven character study Sibyl.Marriage, the film suggests, is like a mosaic. One or two highly coloured tiles might catch the eye but they can’t, on their own, show the whole picture. The reports we get of Sandra and Samuel’s life together (there is only one flashback in the film; most of what we learn comes from the evidence presented in the court) suggest a relationship that gets chillier and spikier by the minute. But then the prosecution’s case relies on cherrypicking the trauma and the deep-seated unhappiness in the marriage, and foregrounding the character traits in Sandra that might make her capable of murder. A choice of other, sunnier moments, as Sandra reasonably points out, would paint an entirely different picture of her relationship with her husband.Even with that in mind, however, there’s plenty of ammunition for the prosecution. As with Saint Omer, it’s more than just a woman on trial here. Just as Diop’s drama wove into its court case an examination of race, class and the status of the female migrant in French society, so Triet seeds the film with questions about divisions of labour, about the role of the wife within marriage and about society’s profound discomfort around a woman who not only takes what she wants from life, but refuses to apologise for it.The fact that Sandra prioritises her career over her share of the childcare, cannibalises her own life and those of others for her writing (a theme that links back to Triet’s previous film, Sibyl) and unashamedly admits to having bisexual relationships during her marriage doesn’t make her guilty of murder. But neither does it conform to the role of victimhood that the accused woman is expected to play. Triet further supports this perception by frequently placing the camera slightly below Sandra – subliminally suggesting that she is a powerful, dominating, even threatening presence – rather than above her, looking down.Did she do it? It’s worth mentioning that when Hüller asked the director this question, Triet refused to say, claiming that she herself didn’t know the answer. Ultimately, one of the key pleasures of the picture is its uncertainty – the niggling doubts that remain, and the sense that a crucial piece of the puzzle is tantalisingly out of reach. This article was amended on 22 November 2023 because an earlier version referred to Sandra and Daniel’ s life together, when it was Sandra and Samuel’s life together which was meant."
Dream Scenario review – Nicolas Cage is at his very best in savagely funny comedy,Cage plays a graceless college professor who becomes famous by turning up in people’s dreams in Kristoffer Borgli’s gradually curdling cringefest,4,"University professor Paul Matthews (Nicolas Cage) is an easy man to ignore. A deliciously peevish performance from Cage paints a character who wears his grievances as stubbornly as the anorak that rarely leaves his back. With his fretfully twitching upper lip and a whining inflection that turns everything he says – even his own name – into a pissy, worming complaint, Paul exists in permanent umbrage.Everything changes, however, when he starts to turn up, initially as a lurking, inscrutable onlooker, in the dreams of strangers. So widespread is this inexplicable phenomenon that Paul starts to enjoy a viral celebrity, a newfound fame that he embraces, toothily and gracelessly, as something that he clearly feels was his due all along. His students finally start to pay attention in class. He is courted by a slick marketing hotshot (Michael Cera). He even finds himself the subject of erotic interest, resulting in a sex scene so mortifying you’ll want to scrape it from your memory with a penknife. And then, just as suddenly, the collective unconscious shifts. Dream Paul goes from a benign to malign presence, from passive to horribly, threateningly active. And the public reaction to real Paul skews accordingly.The follow-up to the brutal satire Sick of Myself from Norwegian director Kristoffer Borgli, Dream Scenario further mines the director’s fascination with fame – the cost of it, the fickle nature of it, the indignities of it. It’s a savagely funny showcase for Cage at his very best. But the picture sours somewhat in a third act that departs from crisp character study to target cancel culture, losing some of its biting humour in the process."
Leo: Bloody Sweet review – leave your logic at the door for rampaging action yarn,"The Tamil version of David Cronenberg’s A History of Violence is wildly enjoyable, packed full of hyenas, car chases, fight scenes and, of course, song and dance",4,"In 1997, John Wagner and Vince Locke published their superb graphic novel A History of Violence: it was the story of an apparently regular guy, a small town Michigan cafe owner, whose unexpectedly accomplished defence of his family during an attempted robbery hints at a dark past which eventually turns out to involve mob entanglements. In 2005, David Cronenberg adapted the novel into the splendid Viggo Mortensen vehicle of the same name, which – Aragorn aside – may represent Mortensen’s finest hour. Now, this new Tamil version has broken several box office records and, at two hours 40 minutes runtime, has plenty of scope to expand on its source material – especially in the 18-certificate “uncut” version which has just entered cinemas.The film opens with the small town of Theog in the snowbound western Himalayas which is under attack by a feisty CGI hyena that has managed to get into the local school playground. One man steps forward: local cafe owner Parthiban (mononymic star Vijay), and handily bests the slavering beast. The hyena shenanigans, however, do not replace but merely precede the badass cafe robbery triumph.But please don’t ask why anyone would be shocked that a man who can take down a rampaging out-of-control hyena in hand-to-claw combat can also face down a few human robbers – it simply isn’t that kind of story-world. The incident with the hyena is there to signal that you are entering a world of spectacle, of non-stop set-pieces and ever-more climactic showdowns. Leave your irrelevant thoughts about logic at the door and instead enjoy some physically impossible car chases, bone-crunching fight scenes and hundreds of mobsters singing and dancing in unison, all set to one of the silliest and most pleasurable soundtracks this side of Paul Oakenfold’s splendid work on Swordfish.Directed with verve and enthusiasm by 37-year-old former bank employee Lokesh Kanagaraj, who moved into directing after winning a short film competition, the influence of the likes of Quentin Tarantino on all of this is very much evident. Indeed, like Tarantino, Kanagaraj has announced his intention to quit directing after completing 10 films. On this evidence, Kanagaraj’s retirement so soon would be a shame. Leo: Bloody Sweet is out now in cinemas."
Showdown at the Grand review – zombie-mashing Dolph Lundgren in ode to 80s action flicks,Terrence Howard is terrific as a cinema owner who hires his ageing movie idol to help him battle corporate goons,3,"‘There are a lot of things to dislike in this world. Nazis. Modern art. Vegans. But above all I despise vampires.” That’s Dolph Lundgren in a growl, wearing a ludicrous wig, and karate-kicking his way through a horde of undead. Lundgren plays ageing action star Claude Luc Hallyday, a veteran of trashy films with trashier titles (Moses v the Nazis!). It’s a supporting role but Lundgren is the main attraction in Orson Oblowitz’s misty-eyed, sentimental, sometimes silly love letter to cinema. The setting is a gorgeous movie palace where the owner has a thing for tough guy Hallyday, watching his 80s action flicks on repeat – funny pastiche clips shot here as little movies-in-a-movie.To be fair, Terrence Howard is also pretty terrific as cinema proprietor George, whose family have owned the Grand since it opened in the 1920s. George grew up in the cinema, and Howard plays him as a man who’s never fully signed up to the outside world, dressed like a cowboy in a long leather duster coat, and speaking in a faintly grandiose way like a character from a classic movie. His problems begin when a corporate developer Lynn (Amanda Righetti) sets her sights on his cinema, planning to bulldoze it to make way for gleaming luxury apartments.Here’s where the film gets a bit daft as Lynn dispatches her goons to make George sign on the dotted line. But George has hired his hero Hallyday – living as a recluse in Estonia – for a sell-out guest appearance. Lundgren is a good sport as the washed up action star, mumbling and barely coherent, and possibly channelling Ozzy Osbourne. It makes for some fun moments and a funny showdown with the baddies. In the old days this would probably have gone straight to tape, so straight-to-download feels like the right place. Showdown at the Grand is released on 13 November on digital platforms."
A Forgotten Man review – watchable account of central figure in Swiss wartime guilt,"Laurent Nègre’s stagey film is also a free adaptation of Thomas Hürlimann’s play on the same subject, and may have worked better in the theatre",3,"Switzerland’s strange postwar burden of quasi-collaborator-guilt, with all its symptoms of evasion and denial, is the theme of this intimately presented black-and-white movie from writer-director Laurent Nègre. It is inspired by the real-life case of Hans Frölicher, the Swiss ambassador to Nazi Germany from 1938 to the end of the war, much approved of by the Nazi elite due to his submissive pro-German loyalty. It is also a free adaptation of The Envoy, Thomas Hürlimann’s stage-play on the same subject.Michael Neuenschwander plays the ambassador, here fictionalised as Heinrich Zwygart; he returns to Switzerland and his handsome family estate in 1945, a haggard and haunted figure with a drink problem, yet outwardly fiercely correct as befits a Swiss public figure and civil servant. Sensing that he might be made the scapegoat for Switzerland’s embarrassment, he has a new plan to prove his enduring patriotism by being as sycophantic to the Americans as he was to the Germans.As for his fellow Swiss, Zwygart finds them blandly relieved that their picturesque cuckoo-clock paradise of neutrality is unscathed. Zwygart’s cantankerous old-soldier father (Peter Wyssbrod) still stoutly proclaims the fiction that Hitler was deterred from invading Switzerland after the fall of France because of the swift mobilisation and continuous battle-readiness of the Swiss army. Zwygart is not-so-secretly contemptuous of Switzerland’s “toy soldiers” and has another theory: Hitler stayed out of Switzerland because Switzerland became the Germans’ discreet banker, the concierge state which facilitated cheap or gratis loans to aid the Nazi war effort, and was a useful financial friend to the party from well before the war.Zwygart was at the centre of this, and conspicuously declined to plead for a pardon in the case of Maurice Bavaud, a Swiss student who attempted to assassinate Hitler in 1938 and was executed; also a real case. But now Zwygart has hallucinatory visions of this would-be killer, the one Swiss who really was on the right side of history. This is a watchable, if somewhat stagey film, and these jump-scare visions, leaping out of the ambassador’s tormented subconscious, might have worked better in the theatre. A Forgotten Man is released on 10 November in UK cinemas."
Skin review – Brazilian city’s protest art maps out supercharged political landscape,"In a wordless paean to Belo Horizonte, this film celebrates the graffiti found throughout the streets as an act of resistance against Jair Bolsonaro",3,"Like large-scale tattoos, colourful murals and graffiti adorn the urban body of Belo Horizonte, a densely populated city in southeastern Brazil. Composed largely of static shots, Marcos Pimentel’s poignant documentary conjures an awe-striking tapestry of artistic expression and revolutionary resistance.Imposing in terms of size, these sprawling street artworks range from kaleidoscopic portraits to fabulously surreal tableaux vivants. For some passersby, these majestic images amount to nothing more than a cool selfie backdrop. Pimentel’s film, however, takes a closer look, lingering on painted words that speak of a yearning for love and intimacy. These utterances of private desire exist side by side with protest slogans calling for Jair Bolsonaro’s resignation and condemning the police. Weaving together the personal and political, Pimentel’s film sees street art as a crucial form of political advocacy at a time when dissenting voices are cruelly repressed.Echoing this collective desire for change, the film’s ambient soundtrack gradually gives way to the sounds of anti-Bolsonaro demonstrations, whose ferocious chants encircle the cityscape like a wake up call. Shouts demanding justice for Marielle Franco, a Brazilian city councillor assassinated for her outspoken views, are accompanied by moving murals paying tribute to her legacy.In addition to their potency as a conduit of creative and political thoughts, the artworks also become a means of cultural archive, bearing witness to state-sanctioned violence, wealth inequality, and brutal acts of oppression. Shot during Bolsonaro’s administration, the final scene of graffiti walls being knocked down may feel like an ominous display of destruction; however, considering the 2022 election in which Bolsonaro was unseated by Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the imagery gains a newfound optimism, gesturing towards a nation’s hopeful rebirth. Skin is available from 10 November on True Story."
Dance First review – the two faces of Samuel Beckett with Gabriel Byrne,"Byrne is a good fit as the conflicted writer, but James Marsh’s crisp biographical film feels at odds with the passion of Beckett’s work",3,"Gabriel Byrne stars as two versions of Samuel Beckett in a film that places the Irish novelist and dramatist in conversation with himself, looking back and unpicking a lifetime’s tangle of love and guilt. It’s a device that aspires to be Beckettian but feels synthetic and contrived – something that is not helped by the pristine look of the picture. The crisp, clean cinematography is certainly striking, but seems a little prissy, disengaging Dance First from the earth and passion and the unpredictable spirit of Beckett’s writing. But Byrne is rather good in the role, his rueful, craggy face a battleground for a war between Beckett’s self-regard and his self-loathing."
Butcher’s Crossing review – Nicolas Cage keeps quiet in buffalo-hunting western,Cage leads a strong cast into the wilderness in an adaptation of John Williams’ punishing novel that cannot quite convey the full horror of its events,2,"John Williams’s punishing 1960 western novel Butcher’s Crossing was described by Bret Easton Ellis as “a precursor to what Cormac McCarthy would do with the genre”. It follows Will Andrews, a dreamy 23-year-old Harvard dropout, as he tags along with Miller, a buffalo hunter targeting hidden valleys in the Colorado territory in the late 19th century. Will hopes to learn “more about this country”; what he gets, as the four-man crew shoots and hacks its way through dwindling herds in ever more treacherous conditions, is a lesson in remorseless brutality. Any screen version would need to find a cinematic equivalent for the prose’s tensile strength, and for what critic Leo Robson calls the “regime of methodical close description” from which Williams offers no respite. In this shallow, corner-cutting adaptation, the director and co-writer Gabe Polsky doesn’t come close.At least he has the casting down pat. The film is well served by Fred Hechinger, one of the cherubic stars of the first season of The White Lotus, who rightly makes us fear for Andrews; ambling off into the wilderness, he looks as out of his depth as a Smurf in Picasso’s Guernica. Nicolas Cage has ample room to kick off as the bearded, bullet-headed Miller, but in fact remains for the most part subdued. One of his wackier moments, when he squats in the moonlit snow drawing an open razor repeatedly across his own bald scalp, is also the movie’s eeriest, its effect weakened only by the antiseptic studio environment.No matter how nasty things get, the screen stays spick-and-span; clothes appear pressed, skin exfoliated. Even after months in the wild, there is no sense that anyone pongs, the way they do in, say, Kelly Reichardt’s First Cow and Meek’s Cutoff. Grisly sights are paraded before the camera (including a castrated hunter and untold bison gore) but Polsky lacks the visual flair to make the shocks visceral or the suffering anything more than superficial. Data-heavy end titles decrying the plundering of nature suggest that we’ve been watching an environmental polemic all along. More proof that the film doesn’t really know what it is or who it’s for. Butcher’s Crossing is released on 1 November on Prime Video."
Stolen review – chilling account of Ireland’s mother-and-baby homes horror,Margo Harkin’s film about child abuse in church- and state-run institutions is a highly skilled assembly of testimony that is as forensic as it is nauseating,4,"There is a numbing sameness about the many documentaries out there about historical trauma, whether they are telling stories of casualties of war, survivors of abuse, or the descendants of either. Exercises in oral and visual history, these films follow strong narrative conventions, perhaps modelled on criminal trials: opening arguments, methodical presentation of evidence, climaxing with quavering testimony from victims.To be frank, Margo Harkin’s documentary reviewing the horrors of Ireland’s mother-and-baby institutions – essentially state- and church-run factories churning out children for adoption, shame and misery – doesn’t swerve far from the template outlined above. But to extend the legal metaphor, she assembles the arguments with the skill of a high-court prosecutor. With forensic precision, it starts with the wider view of how a patriarchal theological obsession with controlling women’s bodies, along with the political context, allowed “industrial” schools, Magdalene laundries and mother-and-baby homes to flourish. Run often by nuns who lived in comfort upstairs while the “girls” – unmarried mothers sent away to give birth in secrecy – lived in squalor in the basement, these so-called homes have only recently had their horrors revealed. The opening story is, of course, the 796 infants and children who died at Bon Secours mother and baby home in Tuam, Galway, and were buried in pits discovered only when the land was being repurposed for development.The focus, and the horror, spreads from there, as Harkin expands by interviewing journalists, politicians, legal scholars and historians, but also poets such as Jessica Traynor, who read pieces about the pain of such places in the ruins that remain. We hear from sons and daughters who lived with mothers that survived these homes and are still searching for siblings who remain unaccounted for, and of course many survivors themselves.While the latter’s stories are as chilling and nauseating as it gets, it’s notable how few tears or raised voices there are. Instead, these women – and it’s mostly women we meet – tell their stories with clenched, clear voices, still seething with rage but rehearsed down into ritual. The big emoting goes on in composer Deirdre Gribbin’s string-heavy score that’s powerfully melancholy but just astringent enough to keep things in check. Altogether, this is a nearly immaculate, exemplary piece of documentary film-making. Stolen is released on 3 November in UK and Ireland in cinemas."
Christmas at the Holly Day Inn review – festive template is gift that keeps on giving,"With meet-cutes and redemption all round, a tame baddie and a dog called Mr Jingles, this British micro-budget tale brings fresh love to tired tropes",2,"If you’ve ever wondered what a Hallmark Christmas movie would look like if you got rid of the former Disney child stars, glossy production locations and Dolly Parton showing up at the end to sing a festive ballad, here we have an answer. This is a British micro-budget answer to holiday themed films such as Falling for Christmas, A Cozy Christmas Inn or A Christmas Cookie Catastrophe – all of which emerged in the last year.The film-makers of this one clearly know the template like the backs of their hands, with the following Christmas romcom tropes present and correct: a wholesome but struggling business enterprise (see title), a trip back home for Christmas (see title), the magic of small communities compared with big cities (guess where the Holly Day Inn is located), a random meet-cute (a roadside tyre-change), the potential change of career (female lead is initially a London-based workaholic), the romantic B-plot involving an older couple (hello, Colin Baker and Anita Dobson), the importance of the spirit of Christmas (passim), the baddie who wants to close the local business (guess who the male lead works for), the big misunderstanding (male lead is mistaken for travel journalist) and of course a cute dog (Mr Jingles). Obviously it’s not original, and that’s the whole point: the idea is to enjoy a warm brew of cliches as comforting as a gingerbread latte on a frosty night.It probably does bear mentioning that there are Christmas pantos around the UK every year with considerably more money to throw around than this film – and as a result, it has the faint sense of one of those unfortunate Winter Wonderland attractions: people shell out £100 to get in, only to realise that the entire thing takes place in the back of a pub car park, Rudolph is made of cardboard and the fairy lights are all from Poundland. But it would be a shame to be too Scrooge-like about this: Christmas at the Holly Day Inn was evidently made with an enormous amount of affection for the genre, and certainly gets a big shiny Christmas star for effort. Christmas at the Holly Day Inn is released on 6 November on digital platforms."
Nobody Has to Know review – whimsical tale of gentle deceit in the Outer Hebrides,Bouli Lanners’ picturesque setting makes room for a lonely woman to take advantage of memory loss and kid the victim they had been lovers,3,"‘Have you guys seen Jason Bourne?” asks Brian (Andrew Still), a farm labourer in the Outer Hebrides, near the start of Nobody Has to Know. “It’s exactly the same kind of set-up!” How droll of the writer-director Bouli Lanners to invoke that breakneck action franchise when his own film could scarcely be more different, save for a plot involving memory loss. The closest thing here to an action set-piece occurs when an estate agent is tardy returning to the office, leaving her colleague to take a later-than-usual lunch break.If this isn’t a film to set the heart racing, it doesn’t leave that organ entirely untroubled; with his script’s echoes of 40s weepie Random Harvest, Lanners is aiming for similar status. The Bourne-lite hero is Brian’s Belgian co-worker Phil (Lanners), who suffers a stroke. Only a mild, photogenic one, mind you, with no paralysis or facial palsy, just a spot of temporary amnesia manifested in purely whimsical terms; he can’t recall, for instance, how a dalmatian named Nigel ended up in his house. This blank slate also makes it possible for the emotionally frigid Millie (Michelle Fairley), daughter of Phil’s boss, Angus (Julian Glover), to pull a While You Were Sleeping-style fast one on him by pretending they were in a relationship. “Are we still together?” he asks, dazed yet hopeful.The British Board of Film Classification lists this “sexual coercion” among the reasons for the film’s 12A rating, but Lanners neutralises potential tastelessness by ensuring that any possible area of conflict – be it the provenance of Nigel, or Phil’s eventual discovery of Millie’s subterfuge – is calmly resolved, leaving behind nary a ripple of drama. Every character here is timid or well-meaning, and even those who haven’t suffered a medical emergency are grappling with issues of the heart.With a script that doesn’t always sparkle as it might, Nobody Has to Know resembles an Aki Kaurismäki film minus the big laughs and drop-dead decor. Frank van den Eeden’s cinematography does most of the heavy lifting, with numerous shots of the dramatic Isle of Lewis landscape, or lone characters staring out to sea. Fairley excels among the understated cast, even if Millie’s emotional trajectory is predictable; from the moment we see her hair pinned tightly to her head, we know that its inevitable loosening can only be 90-odd minutes away. Nobody Has to Know is released on 3 November in UK cinemas."
Five Nights at Freddy’s review – horror game movie is an unscary Halloween trick,A competently made yet maddeningly dull attempt to bring the hit video game to the big screen makes for an instantly forgettable night at the movies,2,"There are five nights to be survived at cursed old pizza spot Freddy Fazbear’s yet it feels like an awful lot more in this surprisingly flat attempt to turn a hit video game into a hit movie. At a flabby, sign-of-the-times 110 minutes, there’s far too much of so many things – dream sequences, exposition, first act buildup – and far too little of what one would naturally expect from something as surface-level silly as this – fun.It’s partly because writer-director Emma Tammi and game creator Scott Cawthon, acting as co-writer here, seem frighteningly unsure of how seriously they’re supposed to take Five Nights at Freddy’s and so we’re left equally confused. It clangs from straight-faced speeches about childhood trauma to cartoonish kids’ movie-level goofiness, tonally awkward and strangely, maddeningly dull, unravelling a mystery that’s as predictable as it is uninteresting. A film about murderous animatronic animals should not have one checking their watch quite so much …Five Nights at Freddy’s tells of a dilapidated Chuck E Cheese-esque pizza restaurant for kids, greasy slices soundtracked by a performing band of robotic mascots. Despite its closure years earlier, a security guard is still required to keep everyone out, a thankless position newly filled by troubled drifter Mike (Hunger Games alum Josh Hutcherson) with help from creepy career counselor Steve (Matthew Lillard). After the death of his parents, he’s tasked with caring for his younger sister despite interference from his meddling aunt (a snarling Mary Stuart Masterson, acting as if she’s a bad guy trying to send Beethoven to the pound). Mike remains stuck, forever haunted by the disappearance of his brother when they were kids, trying to find out what happened to him by replaying the day he went missing through his dreams. But sleeping on the job isn’t the wisest idea …For certain, perhaps older newcomers, there’s something alluringly retro about the lurid B-movie set-up not just because of the 80s heyday of the setting but because of how equally throwback the idea is, recalling horrors of that era based on similarly ludicrous conceits, like Chopping Mall or Dolls or Death Spa. But a modernised take gets quickly deadened by genre problems of our time, focusing less on the nasty fun of watching possessed robot animals kill and more on the tedious inner torment of our one-note protagonist. Hemmed in by a family-friendly PG-13 rating, the death scenes are drab and artlessly censored but even with more violence, Tammi would still struggle to create the suspense we need and expect. Her film never once threatens to quicken one’s pulse (a sequence using a ball-pit is a frustrating dud), the lumberingly slow pace of her tinny villains proving to be a problem she’s never able to fix.She does a mostly competent job as director otherwise, her film looking more polished than many other Halloween offerings this year (Amazon’s 80s-set Totally Killer looking entirely awful in comparison) but it’s not enough to paper over the many cracks that the script introduces, with a dumb, convoluted plot that, even with such an overextended runtime, never makes a shred of sense. There are far too many scenes of Hutcherson’s simple, sad-eyed lead gaining intel from an exposition-spouting cop played by You’s Elizabeth Lail, interactions between the pair feeling like text-on-screen filler you wish you could expedite with a click of a button. There’s just too much dialogue and not enough dying, a fatal misjudgment in just how invested we are in the film’s feeble mystery. The big reveal is a big inevitability and the big showdown is a big letdown, with some misjudged scenery-chewing and laughable stabs at emotion.The low-stakes, late-night thrill we expect from the material never arrives, held back by a mixture of indecisive restraint and misplaced self-importance. Five Nights at Freddy’s is somehow a slog to get through and will be promptly forgotten by morning.Five Nights at Freddy’s is out now in cinemas in the UK and will be released on 27 October in cinemas and on Peacock in the US"
Doctor Jekyll review – Eddie Izzard in gender-flipped reboot of Hammer horror,"Casting Izzard as billionaire scientist Nina, a new incarnation for the classic story’s tormented hero, proves less intriguing than it sounds",2,"There’s something initially intriguing in this gender-flipped take on Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde from the rebooted Hammer studio brand, starring Eddie Izzard as Dr Nina Jekyll. But it soon reveals itself as bafflingly laborious, leaden and self-conscious, with the star often going into the familiar quirky monologue-riffing style, which might be hilarious in Izzard’s standup comedy, but it’s weird in the wrong way here.The comedy in the central performance feels unsettled, undermining the film’s horror potential, which is in any case damaged by the over-egged musical score and misfiring jump non-scares. The legendary dual personae of the story are not interestingly differentiated, or really differentiated at all, both being very much Izzard.Scott Chambers plays Rob Stevenson (middle name Louis), a young guy out of prison on licence, in need of work to please his parole officer, who might also be persuaded to give him access to his adored infant daughter. Thanks to his brother, Rob gets a job as live-in carer to reclusive billionaire scientist Dr Nina Jekyll, who has reportedly withdrawn from public life due to her health issues.Despite the pursed-lipped disapproval of Dr Jekyll’s Mrs Danvers-y housekeeper (played by Lindsay Duncan), something in Rob’s sweetness and honesty amuses Dr Jekyll and she gives Rob the position, with responsibility for looking after her in her vast secluded mansion and seeing that she gets her meds. But soon things go terribly wrong. There are cameos here from no less than Simon Callow and Jonathan Hyde, and it looks like an interesting experiment, but there is something fundamentally inert here. Doctor Jekyll is released on 27 October in UK cinemas."
Beyond Utopia review – nail-biting account of how to get out of North Korea,Tense documentary follows the perilous ‘underground railroads’ defectors need to take to escape from the totalitarian state,4,"The toxic anti-Shangri-La of North Korea continues to provide a rich seam of material for film-makers: the late Claude Lanzmann recounted his personal experiences there in the 1950s in Napalm and Werner Herzog discussed the North Korean reverence for Mount Paektu in Into the Inferno. There are many more, including Álvaro Longaria’s The Propaganda Game, Ross Adam and Robert Cannan’s The Lovers and the Despot, Morten Traavik’s Liberation Day and Ryan White’s Assassins. So far no documentary film-maker to my knowledge has tackled one of North Korea’s strangest events: Kim Jong-un’s summit meeting in 2018 with Donald Trump, the man who’d threatened him with “fire and fury”. Oddly, this otherwise excellent documentary about North Korea doesn’t mention that, despite it coming within its timeline.Beyond Utopia is a nail-bitingly tense account of the network of safe houses and “underground railroads” used by North Korean defectors to get to freedom, run by the South Korean human rights activist and Christian cleric Pastor Kim Sung-eun. (There is real escape footage here.) Despite the well-attested ideological iron grip exerted in North Korea (no one in this film uses the pro-regime term DPRK or Democratic People’s Republic of Korea), there are in fact traffickers and brokers both there and in China who for a price are prepared to get people out.Half of this film is taken up by the heartrending study of a North Korean family being spirited over the border into China by Pastor Kim’s organisation, where they are met by Kim’s associates, who help them to look like South Korean tourists and then conduct them through Vietnam and Laos in conditions of extreme danger (both communist countries that could send them back to North Korea) and finally to freedom in Thailand. It is almost unbearably sad and funny when the elderly North Korean grandma, who can’t rid herself of her lifelong reverence for the Pyongyang leadership, first sees a flat-screen plasma TV and assumes it’s a blackboard for teaching.The film’s second, and more brutal story is about a North Korean woman who has escaped, but whose son, having made a later attempt and got as far as China, has been sent back for brutal punishment; but he could, she is told by informants, be extracted again with payment of more bribes. But is this new plan just a North Korean plot (in which her son and elderly mother have been forced to co-operate) to lure her into a place where she herself can be kidnapped and sent back for a humiliating show trial?The film could have done with a few more specifics. How much money, for example, do the traffickers charge? And where does the money come from? Is it raised by the defectors’ friends and relatives in South Korea? Or does Pastor Kim himself take donations for a continuously running fund? At all events, it’s an outstanding documentary. Beyond Utopia is released on 27 October in UK and Irish cinemas."
Little Palestine: Diary of a Siege review – daily horror of Damascus refugee camp holds warning,This harrowing documentary follows life among starving Palestinians in the Yarmouk camp as Syria’s civil war raged about them,4,"Abdallah Al-Khatib’s searing documentary was completed two years ago; its arrival now has an awful new significance. The film conveys the day-by-day, moment-by-moment experience of Palestinians living in the Yarmouk refugee camp in Damascus, known as “Little Palestine” (in fact, Al-Khatib’s birthplace), while it was under siege by the Assad government from 2013 to 2015. This resulted in 181 people dying of hunger and ended when Islamic State took control of the camp. The terror group were themselves driven out by Russian and Syrian forces in 2018, resulting in most of the camp’s destruction.The slow death from hunger is horrifying. People eat cactus, and then essentially weeds. Al-Khatib’s camera often poignantly lingers on the brave and even cheerful faces of children, but one of the film’s most disturbing moments comes when a little girl is shown placidly foraging in the rough ground among the weeds for the edible herb verbena. Like many of the people the film-maker speaks to, she is in a traumatised but eerily calm state – you can imagine her as an adult or an old woman – as body and mind try to adapt to lack of food. Nor does she appear to be scared, as the interviewer is, by the nearby explosions.A piece of graffiti reads: “I am from a country where windows open on to an absence of food.” An old man asks the film-maker if he has a sugared almond. A rare food-aid agency pours soup into people’s carrier bags, these being the only receptacles left. A man howls in the street: “We don’t want Palestine, just get us out of Syria – is there anything worse than this hunger?” It is a record of the past, but an almost unbearable warning of agony yet to come. Little Palestine, Diary of a Siege is available from 27 October on True Story."
Pain Hustlers review – mesmerising Emily Blunt redeems formulaic US opioid drama,Fantastic Beasts director David Yates’s true-life big pharma scandal is carried by the British actor ​​playing a money-hungry drug rep,3,"David Yates takes time out from being the in-house director of the Fantastic Beasts films with a formulaic, factually based drama on a subject that has already been thoroughly explored by other, more serious-minded movies, documentaries and television series: America’s opioid crisis and the cynical workings of big pharma. Using the accessible but now rather tired device of cutting faux documentary interviews with key characters into a conventional piece of storytelling (see also I, Tonya), the film is a loosely fictionalised version of the Insys Therapeutics scandal. What’s novel here is that the film focuses not on the victims of the aggressively mis-sold cancer pain medication at the core of the story, but on the team of ambitious, money-hungry drug reps and company execs who will stop at nothing to hawk their product to unscrupulous doctors.It’s predictable but glossily watchable. The main redeeming feature is the crackling charisma of Emily Blunt, in the central role of a down-on-her-luck single mum turned pharma marketing genius.In select cinemas now; on Netflix from 27 October"
Nyad review – Annette Bening and Jodie Foster delight in marathon swimming biopic,"Bening is a sixtysomething on a mission to swim from Cuba to Florida, Foster her stoical coach, in this real-life drama of friendship and endurance",4,"This may be the first drama feature from documentary-directing duo Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (Free Solo), but the themes – human endurance, daunting physical challenges, needlessly reckless flirtations with death – provide a link to their previous work. The film tells the real-life story of Diana Nyad (a staunch performance from Annette Bening), a retired endurance swimmer who decided, aged 60, to get back in the water and attempt, once again, the gruelling 110-mile crossing from Cuba to Florida.It’s a swim that takes more than two solid days, through waters populated by sharks and poisonous jellyfish. It defeated her once, at the prime of her fitness. But Diana is ferociously single-minded, making her a formidable athlete but an absolute nightmare at parties. Her best friend and trainer, Bonnie (Jodie Foster), repeatedly has to remind Diana that there are other possible conversational subjects apart from the remarkable achievements of Diana Nyad. And it’s this – the wry humour provided by the long-suffering Bonnie; the lovely lived-in quality of the friendship – rather than the lengthy swimming sequences and a few slightly unwieldy flashbacks that gives the film its crowd-pleasing appeal.In selected cinemas and on Netflix"
Trolls Band Together review – sugary DreamWorks series starts to leave a sour taste,Branch’s boyband past is the hook for this slightly wearying latest instalment of psychedelic animated family fun,2,"The latest film in DreamWorks’ irrepressibly perky and shamelessly Auto-Tuned Trolls series is a synthetic sparkle assault that looks as though it was assembled from the glitter and craft supply section of a well-stocked pound shop. In this, as well as the pick-and-mix greatest hits musical choices and morals, it’s business as usual. The message of this latest round of fizzy pop philosophy stresses the importance of family, along with the usual themes of friendship and finding your voice. A flashback introduces us to the tragic backstory of Branch (Justin Timberlake): he was the youngest member of a boyband, named BroZone, made up of his older brothers. When the band split, so did the fraternal bonds. It’s a peppy sugar rush that should please younger audiences, but the appeal of the series is wearing pretty thin."
Be Useful: Seven Tools for Life by Arnold Schwarzenegger review – self-help tips that are more gain than pain,The bodybuilder turned actor and politician reinvents himself as a motivator with an improvement guide that actually works    ,0,"Arnold Schwarzenegger wants you to know that you’re a lazy piece of shit. But he’s going to tell you politely; with care and a few encouraging suggestions. He’s going to be good-natured and nonjudgmental about it. Or a bit judgmental about it. But only because he doesn’t want you to be a lazy piece of shit any more. Instead, he wants you to be useful.If that titular phrase sounds like something a parent tells their kid when said kid is hovering about after school, that’s because it’s exactly what Schwarzenegger’s disciplinarian policeman father used to tell him (and, indeed, Arnie went on to sponsor a nationwide after-school programme). Schwarzenegger, 76, is now in the “fourth act” of his life. He’s been the world’s most famous bodybuilder, a Hollywood movie star, a surprise (mostly hit) governor of California and now an author and quasi-motivational speaker – the catalyst for which was the viral videos he posted during the US pandemic lockdown.I remember, in April 2020, watching Schwarzenegger on Twitter with his pet donkey Lulu and miniature horse Whiskey. The animals were “demonstrating” social distancing guidance, while their owner radiated warmth in a terrifying time. Then came a different register: his stirring, home-filmed speech after January 6 in which he compared the storming of the Capitol to Kristallnacht and pleaded for the protection of US democracy. Maybe we had underestimated him. Zeitgeist-capturing animal lover; rhetorician for the ages. Who knew?Arnie knew. Because people – “naysayers” – have underestimated him his whole life and he doesn’t want you to doubt yourself for a second. Be Useful is a hybrid work. Part Jordan Peterson’s bro life-hack manual slash pop philosophy (the book’s subtitle, Seven Tools for Life, is very similar to Peterson’s 12 Rules for Life); part Instagram motivational quotes slash Arianna Huffington’s obsession with “thriving”, it is threaded through with relevant memoir.Self-help can be a dubious scene to be a part of. Not financially – the industry is booming to the point where life coaches will charge money for others to take their life-coaching courses in what is, as far as I can tell, a Ponzi scheme for dream-journaling. But there’s the toxic masculinity of an Andrew Tate (and, to a lesser extent, Peterson) or the woo-woo of the wellness crew. Much of it is uncomfortably gendered, with polar extremities of dangerous and twee.But Schwarzenegger, far from the cyborg killing machine of his catchphrase film role, is an amiable instructor. A lot of the basic stuff here works. His idea to beget ideas is walking, which, as he points out, is not an original one (he must have thought of it while standing still); he’s just seconding Nietzsche and Aristotle. He recommends incremental changes at first, which is what most primary care doctors might suggest. Lots of advice is similar to that found in 1980s and 90s classics of the genre that either attempted to compensate for the booming rat-race class or else leaned into it. He talks about surrounding yourself with supportive people. All this is good, sound practice. There are the usual Nelson Mandela and Dalai Lama citations. There is, mercilessly, nothing wacky.And there’s plenty of humour to offset the more Sandhursty bits. When he talks about “putting the work in” during drama training, he jokes that he wants his money back for the accent-removal classes. He chops off the bottom half of every pair of his joggers so he can work on his calves more easily. He’s also extremely smart (it still bums him out that bodybuilders are dismissed as airheads) and obsessed with knowledge. One section is called Be a Sponge. His approach is the opposite of Goveism; Schwarzenegger can’t get enough of experts. Whether it’s being taught how to bricklay to make ends meet, or being schooled on the history of gerrymandering as a rookie politician, Schwarzenegger wants your help. And, in turn, he’ll pay it forward. Sometimes literally, as when donating $1m to Covid relief efforts or in time and mentorship, when teaching kids with learning disabilities to bench-press. He hates the phrase “self-made” because, while he recognises it’s meant as a compliment, he believes the opposite – namely, it takes a village (specifically, in his case, Thal in Austria, and then a man called Fredi Gerstl).There’s always a concern with books such as these: will they acknowledge the discriminatory nature of social hierarchical structures and institutions, economic circumstances, health issues and various other impediments to fulfilling potential? Schwarzenegger nods towards them, but more so takes the line that if he, a kid who grew up in a house with no running water, can make it, then anyone can. People will have their views on that, although he’s transparent that one person’s version of fulfilment (pushing through groundbreaking environmental legislation) might differ from another’s (wholesome family; a good job that pays the bills). He loves pain, because “pain is the measure of growth potential”. I sort of love pain in the service of growth – which is why I’m happy to swim in 4C open water – but most of us would be a bit pissed off if, say, a lackadaisical surgeon butchered our aorta during what was supposed to be a routine procedure. Arnie just sets about counting how many laps he can do to the bathroom while stuck in hospital.The triumph of this book is that it’s quite rare in the self-help canon – or what publishers now term personal development – to not make a cynic such as myself roll their eyes, and this one doesn’t. It’s a shame that whoever was responsible for the jacket blurbs takes a shoving-a-finger-in-your chest approach that isn’t replicated by the variable tone inside, which is sometimes dogmatic but often reflects the genuine kindness and enthusiasm of its author. Be Useful, it turns out, is very helpful. Be Useful: Seven Tools for Life by Arnold Schwarzenegger is published by Ebury Edge (£20).

Our River … Our Sky review – compelling portrait of lives in an Iraqi war zone ,"Maysoon Pachachi’s fiction debut, set in Baghdad in 2006, focuses on individuals behind the headlines, with the river Tigris a recurring symbol",3,"After the American-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, the images of the country that circulated in mainstream media were of destruction and violence, and a sensationalised visual landscape that robbed locals of their individuality. Shot on location in Iraq, this compelling fiction debut from seasoned documentary-maker Maysoon Pachachi paints a slice-of-life portrait of a mixed Baghdad neighbourhood during the tumultuous final week of 2006, a year memorably ended by the execution of Saddam Hussein.Save for a scene where a bargeman fishes out of the water the body of a woman presumably killed for her association with foreign forces, Our River … Our Sky alludes to the horrors of war and sectarian violence in subtle and non-explicit terms. Booming over the ordinary activities of children playing or family meals are the deafening sounds of explosions and harrowing discussions of streets filled with corpses.In its tapestry of intersecting stories, Pachachi’s film underlines how wartime turmoil is more than just bloodshed; it kills the normalcy of everyday life and the capacity for dreams. When life in the present is hanging by a thread, the future is a mirage.At the centre of these interwoven lives is novelist Sara (Darina Al Joundi), who now uses the skills from her English literature PhD to translate paperwork for her fellow Iraqis. If the script, grappling with the burden of representation, occasionally draws certain supporting arcs in broad brushstrokes, Al Joundi’s nuanced and exquisitely moving performance brings an emotional weight to Sara’s dilemmas, as well as to other characters.Emphasising the resilience of those who choose to remain, Pachachi’s film returns again and again to the river Tigris, a location that shows how the bond to a homeland is at once communal, spiritual, and fully corporeal. Our River … Our Sky is released on 20 October in UK cinemas."
René: The Prisoner of Freedom review – further adventures of a celebrity criminal, Helena Třeštíková’s film is a strange sequel to her 2008 portrait of a Czech career felon and his popular notoriety that she helped create,3,"Shot over the course of 20 years, Helena Třeštíková’s 2008 film René followed the near continuous prison stints of her charismatic subject; these happened in parallel with the colossal political changes that took place in the Czech Republic towards the end of the 20th century. Conceived as a sequel to this milestone work, René: The Prisoner of Freedom is another long-term project which charts not just the dehumanising cycle of incarceration, but also the trappings of accidental fame.Beginning with scenes showing the jam-packed premiere of the earlier documentary, which turned René into an unlikely celebrity for Czech audiences, Třeštíková’s new film observes how notoriety does not always translate into economic stability. Struggling to make ends meet, René took on various odd jobs, including as a delivery driver – which landed him back in prison for driving without a valid licence. Seemingly untouched by the media storm, René faces these obstacles with the same existential soulfulness that had made him such a compelling subject in the first film. A prolific writer himself, René frequently quotes authors such as Karel Čapek and Albert Camus in reference to his frequent brushes with the law. The myth of Sisyphus – and his unceasing and absurd task of pushing a rock up the mountain – resonates with a man whose every effort to turn his life around goes up in smoke.While Třeštíková’s earlier film was able to locate René’s life within larger sociopolitical contexts, this sequel, though intimate, is much less rigorous in its investigation of fame – and its seemingly aphrodisiac power over women – still less the director’s own responsibility in creating this media phenomenon. What was once a portrait of a man as well as a nation has now downsized into a much more stylistically and politically moderate affair. René: The Prisoner of Freedom is available from 20 October on True Story."
"Beshkempir, or The Adopted Son review – part childhood memoir, part mysterious folk tale","There are touches of Fellini and Satyajit Ray in the gentle, unforced artistry of Aktan Abdykalykov’s film, which casts the director’s son in the title role",5,"The admirable Klassiki streaming service, in response to some modest proposals from myself, is now showcasing five movies from central Asian film-makers, and the first is this absolute gem from Kyrgyzstan. It is an autobiographical movie by writer-director Aktan Abdykalykov, much acclaimed on the European festival circuit on first release in 1998: a very personal and immediate film, but with the mystery and calm of a folk tale. It’s a story of the director’s own childhood, and he casts his own teenage son Mirlan as himself. Beshkempir has the fluency and candour of something by Satyajit Ray and its ecstatic retrieval of memory makes me think of Fellini’s Amarcord.The film is mostly in black and white but starts in colour and enigmatically gives us flashes of colour throughout, picking out significant images with stabs of rapture: birds, a stretch of sky, a handful of money. We begin with a child’s adoption ritual, the colour of this sequence focusing on the richness of the rugs used and the traditional cradle. We then flashforward 13 years or so and this same baby is now a tough-looking kid, impassively looking at us as he gets his hair cut; this is Mirlan Abdykalykov who reminds me of Shane Meadows’s regular Thomas Turgoose.The boy is Beshkempir, always larking about with his cheeky mates instead of helping his gloweringly resentful dad around the house. They steal honey and release a cloud of bees while they’re doing it. Their hormones freak them out at the sight of any girl or young woman, and they actually spy on a naked woman applying leeches to her skin, a fascinating and comic moment of transgression. Most bizarrely, they sculpt a sand model of a woman, with crude approximations of anatomy, take turns having sex with it and are then surreally interrupted by a herd of cattle which trample over the recumbent sand woman while the kids flee; it is a moment captured by Abdykalykov in an overhead shot, an inspired touch which Fellini would surely have enjoyed. But Beshkempir and his best mate are to fall out over the fact that one local girl very clearly prefers Beshkempir. The mate challenges him to a fight which the friend humiliatingly loses and, in his rage and spite, blurts out what he considers to be Beshkempir’s shaming secret: that he is adopted.A confrontation between the boys’ mothers provides catharsis of a sort; things stabilise, but then Beshkempir’s adored grandmother dies and it is her wish that he deliver a traditional oration at her funeral, proclaiming that he will repay debts claimed by any of his grandmother’s creditors, while forgiving any debts owed to her. The old woman has asked for Beshkempir to do this, not any of the adults, because she wanted him to take on an adult responsibility; it’s a strangely affecting moment. There is a gentle, unforced artistry in Abdykalykov’s film which unfolds to the sound of distant birdsong throughout: it’s a great pleasure to have it revived . Beshkempir, the Adopted Son is available from 19 October on Klassiki."
The Kitchen review – high-energy drama of near-future rundown housing estate,Kibwe Tavares and Daniel Kaluuya co-direct a drama about a funeral-service worker looking for a way out of the chaotic housing block of the title,3,"There’s a rich mix of ingredients in this heartfelt and likably acted film from co-directors Kibwe Tavares and Daniel Kaluuya, set in a chaotic, favela-type London housing estate of the near future, nicknamed “the Kitchen”. It takes something from the French banlieue movies of Mathieu Kassovitz and Ladj Ly, while running a seedier and more downbeat version of the postmodern alienation of Total Recall or Blade Runner. But it is also a slightly sentimental-realist family drama, and I felt that for all its high-energy pyrotechnics, in its final moments The Kitchen paints itself into a bit of a narrative corner.The Kitchen setting itself is tremendously fabricated on screen, with top-notch special effects work; it is a spectacularly rundown housing block surrounded on all sides by glitzy new apartment buildings for the heartless better off. The city authorities have in fact decided on the Kitchen’s demolition and high-handedly ordered residents to leave, but the people are refusing on the grounds that this is where they have built their community and homes – for all its poverty, there is a bustling, vivid atmosphere.Izi (played by actor and musician Kane Robinson) is a hardworking guy, employed by a rather creepy eco-funeral business called Life After Life; it offers to mix post-cremation remains with seedlings and create a memorial plant. Izi is under no illusions as to what it’s actually like living in the Kitchen, and he is saving up for a brand-new modern flat, part of precisely that sprawling property development which is putting pressure on the Kitchen. And here the film cleverly allows you to notice the living-death quality in both these apartments and the funeral plant gardens.At work one day, Izi notices that one of the soulless services routinely taking place in the facility’s antiseptic chapel-style memorial zones is for a woman that he used to date. This woman’s troubled teen son Benji (Jedaiah Bannerman) is there too, the only mourner, and a fellow Kitchen resident. Izi and Benji strike up an uneasy cross-generational friendship, each aware of a certain possibility that can hardly be said out loud. And back in the Kitchen itself, where armed police are getting ready to move in with tyrannical force, Benji has to decide if he wants to hang out with radical hoodlums or with caring, flawed Izi. But then Izi, too, must decide if he can imagine a future with Benji.There are some big-ticket action sequences: the robbing of an online food delivery van and a smash-and-grab raid on a jeweller in a posh part of town. They are impressive setpieces, not precisely exciting in the way they would be in a more generic thriller, but fiercely presented as symptoms of inequality. It is with the actual relationship between Izi and Benji that I felt that the movie moved with a heavier tread, though there are also some sharp notes of humour – the film providing a big laugh when Izi has to answer the flat-rental company’s infuriatingly bland auto-generated voice prompts when he arrives to pay his deposit.

Lies We Tell review – high stakes and heiresses in tightly laced gothic tale ,An orphaned Irish teenager spars with her scheming uncle in this insightful reworking of Sheridan Le Fanu’s novel,4,"Here is a tightly laced, elegantly cut gothic period drama that might unfairly get overlooked as the barrage of upmarket cinema vying for awards begins. The 19th-century source material, Sheridan Le Fanu’s novel Uncle Silas, isn’t super well-known outside university literature departments, and the lead actors aren’t especially famous names either – although gravelly-voiced David Wilmot, here playing the heavy, has built a career making indelible impressions with supporting roles on film (The Wonder, Ordinary Love, Calm With Horses) and TV (Station Eleven). Likewise, if you caught limited TV series Ridley Road then the talents of Agnes O’Casey will already be a known quantity. But in a way, the freshness of face and/or versatility of both O’Casey and Wilmot, along with the rest of the cast, are what makes this feel like a discovery. It’s definitely something new and different as it insightfully reworks some classic feminist literary notions, filtered through a very 21st-century approach to period material with its unsettling score, jittery editing and nods to horror tropes.At a girthy mansion called Knowl, at one point described as “a barracks of a place” somewhere in the Irish countryside, teenager Maud Ruthyn (O’Casey) has just inherited everything after the death of her father. However, she’s still a minor and, more unfortunately for her, a woman and therefore not fit to make decisions for herself; Maud therefore becomes the ward of her uncle Silas (Wilmot) until she comes of age. Keen to honour her father’s wishes and the terms of her inheritance, Maud welcomes Silas to her home even though she barely knows him and that he was once accused of murdering a man to whom he owed money – but got off thanks to lack of evidence. Exuding the slithery bonhomie of a cobra meeting a mongoose for the first time, Silas makes himself at home, bringing along his feckless son Edward (Chris Walley) and flibbertigibbet daughter Emily (Holly Sturton), along with Emily’s governess Madame (Grainne Keenan). Before long, Silas’s sinister intentions become clear, which include bullying Maud into marrying her cousin Edward and bribing the servants to turn against her. When brutalising her by proxy doesn’t work, the conspirators threaten to have her committed to an asylum for hysterical women, equipped with what sounds like a 19th-century waterboarding kit.But Maud has a mongoose’s survival instinct, and the haughty blue-eyed gaze of an aristocratic matron who won’t be screwed around so easily. The script by Elisabeth Gooch appropriates the fruity diction of the times just enough to add credibility without getting bogged down in circumlocution, and O’Casey’s delivery is sharp as a steak knife. It’s a delight to watch her verbally spar with Wilmot’s Silas, coyly jabbing at each other according to the rules of civility but growing more acrimonious as the stakes get higher. Director Lisa Mulcahy (Wasteland, The Legend of Longwood) clears the paths and lets them rip with confident, clear-sighted direction. Lies We Tell is released on 13 October in Irish and Northern Irish cinemas."
Smoke Sauna Sisterhood review – the powerful intimacy of women’s shared stories,"Anna Hints follows a group of Estonian women into their secluded cabin, where their communion is almost mystic and no topic is off limits",4,"There is such raw emotional intimacy in this dazzling documentary from Estonia, filmed in a cabin in the woods where a group of women meet regularly to take a sauna. Estonia’s centuries-old tradition of smoke saunas is Unesco-listed, we learn in the final credits (along with French baguette-making and beekeeping in Slovenia, according to the agency’s website). In the past, babies were born in smoke saunas, the sick were brought to them; they were even used to cure ham. For the women in the film, in the hours sweating naked in the hut – away from families, phones, the relentless exhausting to-do list of being a woman – something happens. They talk: sharing stories, saying the unsayable, nothing off limits. It sounds cheesy but in a deep way the experience is cleansing, sweating the pain away.There is an otherworldly intensity to director Anna Hints’ photography, illuminating faces and flesh like candlelight, all warmth and heat. The women’s conversations cover everything, from body image hang-ups to complicated relationships with their mothers. There’s a funny bit about dick pics; one woman wonders what would happen if she started sending “pussy pics” to men. Every now and then they dash outside for a freezing dip in the lake (in winter taking an axe to the frozen-over water to dig a bathing hole). The chanting and birch-branch cleaning – presumably ancient smoke sauna rituals – add to the sacred-space mystical feel. (It also made me think of Kate Bush – she’d love this vibe, I’m sure.)This is a film that weaves a spell, the camera resting often not on the woman talking but on the person listening to her, thereby creating the impression of a universal experience of women. One listener in particular is transfixing; eyes shut, she seems to absorb others’ experiences into her body. We watch her face as a woman tells the story of how she was brutally raped as a teenager while hitchhiking; it’s a moment of shocking power that any writer thinking of adding a rape scene to a fiction film should be forced to watch first. Smoke Sauna Sisterhood is released on 13 October in UK and Irish cinemas."
The Miracle Club review – Maggie Smith can’t save this rocky road trip to Lourdes,Laura Linney is upstaged by older co-stars Smith and Kathy Bates in this sentimental tale about a group of Dublin women who go on a spiritual journey together,2,"Who’s up for a golden-hued heartwarmer set in 60s Ireland starring Kathy Bates and Maggie Smith about women with secret fears and dreams going on a church trip to Lourdes and finally finding the real miracle is their new compassion for each other? The answer to this question could well have been … me. I have a liking for a gentle tale and there is nothing necessarily wrong with, just occasionally, showing Ireland and the church of this period with something other than outrage and horror. But The Miracle Club does not at any time, to use a discredited metaphor, throw away its crutches and walk. And it’s painful to note that this is largely because of the way film can’t convincingly use that estimable actor Laura Linney in a central role. She is upstaged by the older, fruitier performances and doesn’t hold her own with a more serious persona.In a tough district of Dublin, four women each have reasons for going on a trip to Lourdes. Tough-as-nails Eileen Dunne (Bates) is worried about the lump she has found in her breast, but would rather go to Lourdes than see a doctor; her shiftless husband Frank (Stephen Rea) wonders grumpily who is going to cook his supper. Maggie Smith is Lily Fox, a woman with a small disability in her leg, but whose reasons for going to Lourdes are more to do with her spiritual pain at the loss of her son. Twentysomething Dolly Hennessy (Agnes O’Casey) is going to bring along her little boy who for some reason will not speak. All find that their menfolk are obstructive about wives going to Lourdes or indeed doing anything independent whatsoever.But the older women are astonished at the arrival from the US of Chrissie (Linney), the errant daughter of their deceased best friend. She left under a cloud 20 years before for reasons easily guessed at, and now wants to come along to Lourdes as well – and she’s roundly resented for it. When the women do arrive in Lourdes in the company of kindly Fr Dermot (Mark O’Halloran) there is some fun to be had in the holy-water baths they are expected to take and it is funny when Bates and Smith, gingerly stepping into the icy depths dressed in towels, squawk with genuine horror at the chill – the film’s one genuine moment, adroitly juxtaposed with memories of how some women took ice-cold baths to bring about miscarriages.But Linney looks solemn and inert; and the movie’s darker revelations feel mishandled, given the general note of lenient sentimentality. The figures of Eileen and Lily might remind you of the 60s Dublin matriarch Agnes Browne, played by Anjelica Huston in the 1999 movie of the same name, the character that screenwriter Brendan O’Carroll later developed for his broad TV comedy Mrs Brown’s Boys. This is a film that makes great demands on your piety.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotion The Miracle Club is released on 13 October in UK and Irish cinemas."
Speed Is Expensive review – engaging homage to motorcycle legend Philip Vincent,Ewan McGregor narrates an orderly and perhaps too polite profile of the engineer and inventor behind some of the world’s finest motorbikes  ,3,"Speed is expensive, as Ewan McGregor did not say in Trainspotting. The line was uttered by Philip Vincent, a Harrow-educated motorbike designer who made some of the world’s fastest – and priciest – motorbikes of the postwar era. This serviceable documentary narrated, a bit blandly, by McGregor tells Vincent’s story with contributions by fellow celebrity petrolheads Jay Leno and the Clash’s Paul Simonon.Vincent was clearly a man of extraordinary drive and determination. He went into business aged 19, after being booted out of Cambridge for spending more time tinkering than studying engineering. When he opened a factory in Stevenage, they’d test drive the motorbikes on local roads; an employee once got caught doing 110 mph. This was in the 1930s, and when the case came to trial, the judge refused to believe a motorbike could reach such a speed, and dismissed the case, warning the police not to waste court time.The profile of Vincent here does, however, feel somewhat underdeveloped, perhaps out of politeness. Employees remember him as high handed and arrogant – “he wound people up” – but we don’t hear the stories and anecdotes that would have brought the man to life. What is clear is that Vincent was a better inventor than business owner, and by the 1950s, his factory was losing huge sums of money. Its bikes fell out of fashion, too; one of its final models laughed off as “an old man’s wheelchair”.After the factory went under, Vincent scratched a living writing for motorcycle magazines. His daughter recounts his unhappy final years, living in a council house in west London. Inevitably perhaps, Vincent bikes have become collector’s items – in 2018, a 1951 Black Lightning sold for nearly $1m, setting the record for most expensive motorbike at auction. Speed Is Expensive is released on 14 October in UK cinemas and is available now on digital platforms. This article was amended on 10 October 2023 to remove a reference to “motorways”, which were not in existence at the time."
The Bikeriders review – potent ode to the violent lives of 60s biker gangs,"London film festival Jodie Comer, Austin Butler and Tom Hardy are magnetic in this power struggle-cum-love triangle inspired by Danny Lyon’s 1968 photographic study of Chicago bikers",5,"Jeff Nichols’s motorcycle movie is about a love triangle and a succession crisis – inspired by the immersive 1968 study of Chicago bikers by photojournalist Danny Lyon, whose black-and-white pictures flash up with the closing credits. This film opens up the storytelling throttle with a throaty growl, delivering the doomy romance of an old-fashioned western and the thrills of a mob drama.The Bikeriders is set in a world in which the increasingly careworn gang leader competes for the affection of his toughest follower with this man’s girlfriend, while at the same time grooming him as his heir. Yet this is a group where the biker king – whatever his plans for a dauphin – can be challenged for the crown by any subordinate according to the rules of his own violence-democracy, the incumbent gruffly asking: fists or knives?Tom Hardy is Johnny, truck-driver, family man and founding head honcho of the 60s Chicago motorbike club, The Vandals, inspired to form his gang after the ecstatic epiphany of watching Marlon Brando in The Wild Ones on TV; the film’s whole approach in laying out Johnny’s life circumstances is to imagine an answer to Brando’s famous reply to being asked what he’s rebelling against: what do you got?His leather-clad guys and blacktop battlers have monikers like something from West Side Story: bleary draft-reject Zipco (Michael Shannon); beefy Cockroach (Emory Cohen); loyal lieutenant Brucie (Damon Herriman); California recruit Funny Sonny (Norman Reedus) and dependable footsoldiers Corky (Karl Glusman) and Wahoo (Beau Knapp).Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotionBut the toughest, sexiest and most smoulderingly badass of the whole lot is Benny, played by Austin Butler, the only one of the Vandals who directly takes on the law and whose violent altercation with civilian locals results in a gruesome injury which Johnny will have to avenge – leading to his gang’s mutation into a quasi-crime mob, attracting starstruck wannabe joiners from all over the country, including Vietnam vets with serious drug habits, making the burden of leadership all but intolerable.But Benny is deeply in love with Kathy, played by Jodie Comer with tough pugnacity and an outrageous northwestern accent with which you could slice a chrome tailpipe in two. She is effectively the narrator, speaking to Danny Lyon himself, played by Mike Faust. Like Lorraine Bracco’s Karen in Scorsese’s Goodfellas, Kathy is a respectable working-class woman who never intended to get drawn into this world, but found Benny very attractive just as he was beguiled by her cool, sceptical confidence. It is Kathy who can see the ritual absurdity of the Vandals’ codes of masculinity – how, having affected to despise rules, they set up a club with a huge amount of rules, followed with pedantic solemnity like a cross between the army and the Rotary club. She can see how her Benny is going to die one day in the service of this crazy group, and so a duel for possession begins between her and Johnny.Unlike the heroes of Dennis Hopper’s Easy Rider – a film which is to provide employment for one of the group – the bikeriders have no end or quest in view. They just drift around, assemble for “picnics” in green spaces they churn into mud during races and get into fights with other gangs with whom they later cordially have beers. A lot of their time is spent almost catatonically hanging out at a bar in which there is a big discussion about the costs involved in installing a phone behind the bar which their membership subs would entitle them to use on club business.The Bikeriders is in its way like Kathryn Bigelow’s The Loveless (1981) in depicting the grain of their empty world, while stopping short of showing us their places of employment. What we’re watching is a weekend existence, like that of army reservists: we don’t get to see Johnny’s work as a truck driver – although on his way out of the house for a rumble, he tells his wife he’ll pick up some eggs on the way home. As for Benny’s life, it appears to be Kathy paying the bills and putting the roof over his head – although there is no question of Benny feeling emasculated, other than when she has to look after him after an injury.The biker’s way of life is not precisely ironised or satirised, and the film incidentally doesn’t question its heterosexuality (gay biker images which were to become an underground US pop culture staple do not feature). Johnny and Benny’s relationship is more father and son. The performances here aren’t subtle exactly: with Comer’s fierce twang, Butler’s soft purr and Hardy’s sibilant Brandoesque drawl. But there’s such enormous potency and impact in everything they do onscreen."
"Cry, the Beloved Country review – utterly absorbing tale from the birth of apartheid",Zoltan Korda’s 1951 adaptation of Alan Paton’s crusading novel is filled with passion and moral fortitude,5,"Zoltan Korda’s thrilling movie version of Alan Paton’s novel was first released in 1951, when South Africa’s racist apartheid policy was only three years of age and maybe enough of a novelty to be thought of as something amenable to second thoughts, capable of being reformed or even abolished. Paton’s novel itself was published in 1948, the same year as apartheid appeared. Now this film is rereleased, revealing again that it has a crusading preacher’s urgency and moral seriousness, appropriate for a story of priests.After a slow start, the movie hits a muscular, compelling stride; it is a drama with an obvious biblical parallel, but also a quite genuine Shakespearean resonance in the tragic dimension of its final act and the Montague/Capulet reconciliation it envisions for black and white, bought with the self-sacrificial forgiveness for a capital crime. Perhaps modern audiences would be restive at a story about apartheid South Africa that appears to centre its eventual moral judgment amid the white community and white victimhood, but its passion and idealism blaze out.It is a drama of the country and the city. In the fictional village of Ndotsheni, whose lush upper slopes are farmed by the white man and the stonier lower ground by the “natives”, an old black minister, Stephen Kumalo, is deeply troubled by the absence of his son, named Absalom, perhaps after King David’s son in the Bible. Absalom has some years before left for the fleshpots of Johannesburg, allegedly to find his aunt, Stephen’s sister, who has reportedly gone to the bad there. But Absalom, like many others, has also sought the higher wages and greater freedoms offered in the city. He may well have simply gone to the bad himself.Kumalo is played by the veteran US stage and screen actor and civil rights campaigner Canada Lee, who in making this British film was a refugee from America’s McCarthy-ism (like its uncredited co-writer John Howard Lawson). Lee’s performance is the very embodiment of sorrow in old age borne with stoicism, and his anguished gaze seems to wander almost sightlessly all over the screen.Meanwhile, in parallel, a white farmer called Jarvis (played with thoughtful restraint by Charles Carson) works the land as best he can; he is a Forsterian “sun-dried bureaucrat” complaining like his white neighbours about the shortcomings of his black workforce, and baffled and irritated by the liberal enthusiasms of his son, who lives in Johannesburg and works for better housing for the black population. Jarvis may be a political hawk, but his wife is a gentle dove: this is Margaret, played by Joyce Carey (perhaps best known as the railway teashop manager in David Lean’s Brief Encounter; her more refined voice here puts the stage cockney into perspective).Stephen journeys to Johannesburg, as innocent as a child for all his grey hairs, on a mission to find his son; he is helped there by a brotherhood of missionary clergymen, including Msimangu (an excellent, forthright performance from Sidney Poitier). And here he is to come across his worldly scapegrace brother John (Edric Connor), a carpenter who cares nothing for Stephen’s scruples, and also his son’s pregnant girlfriend. He will discover the awful truth about Absalom (Lionel Ngakane) and his drift into crime and his fateful connection with Jarvis’s well-meaning, campaigning son – whose journals old Jarvis is finally to read, and from which he gains some understanding about South Africa for the first time in his life.Cry, the Beloved Country is very greatly about the importance of the Christian church as a unifying moral force: an authority in which black and white can find unity (in this way so very similar to the US civil rights movement). It is unashamedly and unfashionably a religious film, with a vehement speech from the white Father Vincent (Geoffrey Keen), delivered to Stephen in the depths of his agony and angry doubt. It also has a belief in decency (two different characters make apologies, at two different stages, about the rude and boorish way that they have just behaved); quaint, perhaps, but also possessing dignity and idealism. It is an utterly absorbing film. Cry, the Beloved Country is released on 9 October on digital platforms, Blu-ray and DVD."
The Great Escaper review – Michael Caine and Glenda Jackson exude ineffable class,"The two British icons bring a huge amount of joy to the heartwarming true story of Bernard Jordan, the 89-year-old veteran who snuck off to attend the 70th anniversary of D-day",4,"Michael Caine and the late Glenda Jackson bring their A games to this true-life heartwarmer about the 89-year-old second world war Royal Navy veteran Bernard Jordan, who in 2014 jauntily sneaked out of his seaside care home (where he lived with his wife Irene) on a secret mission to get aboard a cross-channel ferry and attend the 70th anniversary celebrations of the D-day landings in Normandy — having failed to get included on an official group excursion. He was dubbed “the great escaper” in the press although then, as now, the care home insisted that there was no question of forbidding Bernard from going, so there was no escape as such. Facetiously representing them as busybody elf ’n’ safety camp commandants – tempting though this might have been – could have landed the film in legal hot water.Caine is Jordan, of course, bringing plenty of droll and lugubrious spark to the role, shuffling up and down the seafront, grumpily denouncing the trendy cyclists almost running him over on the pavement as “tossers” and letting the air out of their tyres. But he is arguably upstaged by Jackson as Irene, or Rene, who is sarky and sardonic to everyone, including her care worker Adele (an excellent performance from Danielle Vitalis).She gets laughs in a way Caine’s character doesn’t, or not as much. Rene has to cover up for Bernard; she is, after all, in on his plan, and tells the nurses and managers that her absent husband is just out on a long early walk, giving Bernard enough time to get on the ferry before the alarm is raised.There’s a huge amount to enjoy from these legendary performers: Caine and Jackson are a great double-act, despite being apart for much of the film, and the film imagines an interesting and poignant rapport between Bernard and an elderly ex-RAF officer on the ferry, sympathetically played by John Standing, who is heading for Normandy while crucified by a secret guilt. Caine has a bold flash of rage by the official graves at all the criminal waste of lives created by war.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotionSet against this, the flashback scenes of the young Rene and Bernard are less strong and a flaw in the film is that it somehow can’t help drifting towards an officially sanctioned sentimentality and even stateliness, rather like the BBC news coverage of the D-day celebrations of which we see a glimpse. It’s a kind of piety which the (excellent) lead performances are always working against. I’m inclined to wonder how many movie versions of Captain Sir Tom Moore and his legendary lockdown charity walk were once in development in the same vein, with the same present day/wartime flashback structure, but which now have had to be abandoned or radically reimagined.Well, Caine and Jackson and their ineffable class give this film some real grit: it’s a wonderful last hurrah for Jackson and there is something moving and even awe-inspiring in seeing these two British icons together. The Great Escaper is released on 6 October in UK cinemas, and in May 2024 in Australia."
Blackberry review – souped-up account of the rise and fall of ‘Crackberry’,Hilarity and pathos intertwine in this likable comedy as the smartphone creators go loopy with wealth – and slack-jawed when the iPhone spoils the party,3,"Here is a punchy Canadian comedy-drama in that burgeoning true-life genre which could loosely be called Tech Startup Hubris; we’ve seen Dumb Money (about GameStop), WeCrashed (about WeWork), and The Beanie Bubble (about the bizarre 90s web-driven tulip-style craze for Beanie Babies). The great ancestor of them all is naturally David Fincher’s The Social Network, about Facebook, with its propulsive script by Aaron Sorkin. This film is a fictionally souped-up account of the steep rise and sudden fall of the BlackBerry, the handset device that towards the end of the 00s was so ubiquitous and addictive among the white-collar classes it was known as the “Crackberry”.But then Steve Jobs unveiled his iPhone, and the BlackBerry executives suddenly looked like a bunch of brontosauruses that had been hit in the face by a meteor.Jay Baruchel plays BlackBerry’s greying co-founder Mike Lazaridis; a shy, nerdy, brilliant innovator who is details-obsessive. Matt Johnson, who is the film’s director and co-writer, plays Mike’s goofball partner Doug Fregin, and Johnson’s directing duties perhaps meant he’d taken the eye off his own performance a little, as he does little other than stare with sweaty, slack-jawed and horrified incredulity at his buddy Mike selling out to the Man.This latter is represented by gimlet-eyed investor Jim Balsillie, played by Glenn Howerton, almost unrecognisable from his role on TV’s It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia; Balsillie is the uptight suit-wearing guy who gets these nerdy Star Wars-loving dopes and slackers into financial shape (while of course betraying their creative, fooling-around ethos). These three cartoony personae loosely correspond to Mark Zuckerberg, Eduardo Saverin and Sean Parker as portrayed in The Social Network; none of them, however, have a family or romantic life away from the office, an important part of how Sorkin conceived his characters.Well, this is a watchable enough film; there is hilarious delusion in Balsillie’s fanatical desire to buy up hockey teams with his new superwealth, and pure pathos when the BlackBerry team watch Jobs demonstrating the iPhone, like silent movie veterans witnessing the new talkies, speaking out loud their own imminent demise. Blackberry is released on 6 October in UK and Irish cinemas."
Where the Wind Blows review – Hong Kong gangland meets Singin’ in the Rain,Tony Leung Chiu-wai and Aaron Kwok play rival cops in this confusing but visually arresting 60s-set thriller,2,"In this decidedly odd mishmash of genres, hard-boiled Hong Kong police corruption and gangland intrigue rub shoulders with a dance montage that pays homage to Singin’ in the Rain. The latest from director Philip Yung (Port of Call), Where the Wind Blows is ambitious and visually arresting (it’s particularly recommended for fans of slow-motion shots of people walking moodily through the neon-drenched underbelly of 1960s Hong Kong). Unfortunately, even the considerable star power of Tony Leung Chiu-wai and Aaron Kwok in the lead roles of rival cops can’t salvage this cluttered and frequently bewildering piece of storytelling."
Saw X review – unstintingly inventive torture porn,Serial killer John Kramer finds a new lease of murderous life in the thoroughly unpleasant 10th outing of the horror franchise,3,"Amputation devices, eye-socket vacuum contraptions, auto-craniotomy and an entrail lasso: it’s business as usual, then, for the torture carousel that is the Saw franchise. A terminal cancer diagnosis has not mellowed the endlessly inventive serial murderer John Kramer (Tobin Bell, looking even more like a judgmental skull than usual) in a 10th outing, which is set in a time period between the first and second instalments.Having run out of options with conventional medicine, John travels to Mexico for risky – and very expensive – experimental treatment. You can probably guess where this is going. He leaves, if not with a new lease of life, then at least with a renewed appetite for his “hobby”. Grisliness occurs, accompanied by a score that sounds like knives being sharpened on violins. It’s thoroughly unpleasant, but that’s rather the point."
The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar review – Wes Anderson and Roald Dahl are a perfect fit,Ralph Fiennes and Benedict Cumberbatch star in the director’s lovingly detailed ​short film based on Dahl’s tale of a man who can see through objects,4,"Only the most hardened Wes Anderson sceptic could fail to be charmed by the director’s latest. The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar is his second Roald Dahl adaptation (after Fantastic Mr Fox) and, at just 37 minutes’ running time, it’s a densely detailed journey with an intricate Russian doll story structure. The baton is passed from narrator to narrator, starting with Ralph Fiennes as Dahl in his writing shed; then, among others, to Benedict Cumberbatch in the title role of Henry Sugar, an affluent playboy and inveterate gambler who develops the ability to see through objects. It’s a skill he hopes to use to cheat at cards, but he discovers something rather more profound instead.This is an archetypal Anderson film: mannered, fussy, obsessively designed – normally irksome traits, but in this alchemic instance it’s an utterly delightful combination. On Netflix"
Fair Play review – enjoyably lurid Wall Street battle of the sexes,A promotion imperils the relationship between two hedge fund analysts in Chloe Domont’s overheated psychodrama,3,"Sex and power are inextricably grafted together in the relationship between Emily (Phoebe Dynevor) and Luke (Alden Ehrenreich), both rising star analysts for a Wall Street hedge fund. Which is fine, as long as both are on an even footing. But then Emily unexpectedly gets promoted, and Luke’s alpha male assurance shrivels, along with his libido.The slick feature debut from TV director Chloe Domont (Ballers, Billions), Fair Play pitches a battle of the sexes in a cut-throat arena where one misjudgment can cost tens of millions of dollars. Wildly ambitious employees scan the office like expensively tailored meerkats, scenting danger in their colleagues’ successes. And Luke, face set in a grimace of a smile, chips away his girlfriend’s self-esteem with a drip-feed of doubts. It’s maliciously effective, up to a point: an enjoyably lurid piece of classy-trashy psychological warfare. Unfortunately, both the plot and the performances boil over in the third act, and the film loses much of its icily calculated cool.In select cinemas now; on Netflix from 6 October"
"Time Addicts review – drug-fuelled, time-travelling fairytale in Melbourne",A mission to steal a bag full of crystal meth sparks an enjoyable labyrinthine sci-fi adventure for two bickering addicts,3,"Denise (Freya Tingley) and Johnny (Charles Grounds) are drug buddies living in present-day Melbourne. When they’re not getting high, they spend their time mooching about, bickering, and arguing about whether some of the fancier words Johnny uses are real. (Funnily enough, most of the time they are.) They are what the cops might uncharitably describe as no-hopers.In what turns out to be a labyrinthine time-travelling plot, one day, the dirty duo’s regular drug dealer, Kane (Joshua Morton), sends them on a mission to a dilapidated house to steal a bag full of crystal meth, a chore that will clear their debt to him. Kane warns them not to try the supply, but of course garrulous Johnny does and within seconds he evaporates with a snap and whoosh of wind right before Denise’s face. In an edit, he finds himself in the same house but 25 years or so in the past, when the home was in better nick and occupied by jumpy former undercover cop Tracey (Elise Jansen). In the present, meanwhile, Denise meets her future self who is also using the time-travel meth and has come back to give her a warning. The rest of the movie skips back and forth, using the same location and four actors, until it gradually reveals the fundamental relationships between the characters and periods.Nerdy viewers can watch and nitpick over whether the sci-fi logic makes any sense, but it’s clear that writer-director Sam Odlum is less interested in quantum mechanics than in crafting a surreptitiously affecting “fairytale for cunts” – to quote a phrase Denise mutters early on. And like a good fairytale, there is a lot of business with lost relatives, secret identities and people stuck in magically enchanted locations that help to keep the budget low. Grounds and Tingley in particular keep their performances just on the biting point between broadly comic and genuinely vulnerable, making for a viewing experience that is altogether more enjoyable than a bare-bones plot description suggests. Time Addicts is released on 25 September on the Icon Film Channel and on 27 October in UK cinemas. In Australia, it will screen at Monster Fest in Melbourne in October, ahead of a 7 December cinematic release."
Surprised by Oxford review – faith-based student romance offers glazed-over unreality,"Adapted from Carolyn Weber’s memoir of the same name, Ryan Whitaker’s  drama suggests that finding love and God when you least expect it is a deeply bland affair",2,"This is a film based on a true story, but it doesn’t make this faith-based romantic drama look or feel anything like reality. It is adapted from a memoir by the American author and academic Carolyn Weber about her time at Oxford on a full scholarship writing a PhD on the Romantics. I felt it in the pit of my stomach about 10 minutes in when it dawned on me the “surprise” was that she found God.Directed by Ryan Whitaker, this is a film very much in keeping with the conventions of Christian drama: blandly inspirational with a glazed-over style of acting, aside from some gobsmackingly unsubtle eccentric professors, hammily performed by actors including Simon Callow. (I half-wondered if the crew stumbled across poor Callow on the streets of the city and frogmarched him on to the set.)Rose Reid plays Caro, a hardworking and gifted American student who arrives at the fictional Tirian college on a full scholarship. Flashbacks to her childhood shine a light on Caro’s drive and determination. In the present day, we get Oxford-for-foreigners, all pints, and crazy Brit traditions, architectural splendour, even a horse-mounted bobby offering her a lift in the wee hours.In her first couple of weeks, agnostic-bordering-atheist Caro meets tousle-haired fellow American Kent (Ruairi O’Connor), a Christian who plans to stay chaste until marriage. (“It’s more a well-intentioned attempt than a reality.”) The will-they-won’t-they relationship between Caro and Kent is deadly boring (and conducted within the bounds of a U certificate). The intellectual debate between them on the nature of faith – touching on CS Lewis’s memoir about his conversion to Christianity, Surprised by Joy – is even more dreary. Like a lot of faith movies, it reminded me of Socialist Workers selling papers on the high street: the purpose is to convert people but really it feels like they are just talking to themselves. Surprised by Oxford screens on 27 September and 1 October in UK cinemas"
Mutzenbacher review – erotic novel reading makes men the object of the porn gaze,"Ruth Beckermann’s documentary centres around a fake audition in which men read aloud from a once scandalous 1906 novel, revealing the grotesque and humorous nature of male fantasy",3,"Here is a strange, stark documentary from Austrian film-maker Ruth Beckermann, first presented at last year’s Berlin film festival: somewhere between a lab experiment and a practical joke, featuring the kind of non-professional performers who could easily crop up in a movie by Ulrich Seidl, that renowned Austrian chronicler of male grotesqueness.The film’s purpose is to challenge the gendered nature of erotica and pornography through the simple but effective expedient of making men the object of the porn gaze. Beckermann puts men on camera as they read aloud – at various levels of excruciating discomfort – the female narrative voice from Josephine Mutzenbacher, a once-scandalous Viennese novel that contains the fictional confessions of a prostitute, published anonymously in 1906 and now thought to be the work of Felix Salten, who bizarrely also wrote the original Bambi books.Beckermann advertised for men to audition for a film version of Josephine Mutzenbacher that she claimed to be making, but of course wasn’t. Age and experience? No problem. She gets the resulting miscellaneous bunch (one man actually has an ear trumpet) to sit on a plush red couch in what looks like some disused factory, and choose an explicit passage from the book to read aloud. Afterwards, she asks what they think, about their own early sexual experiences and what they think about the book’s still controversial paedophile passages. Periodically she gets her auditionees to gather together and chant the crudest bits like a football crowd. Many of the men are humorous and articulate; others are disquietingly intense and weird. One man commented that all the men in the book are revealed to be equally base, like those in Lars von Trier’s Dogville – a very interesting and apt comparison, one that comes close to intuiting the Von Trier-ish trick being played on these men.But these men no doubt had to sign some sort of legal waiver to be used in the film, and perhaps Beckermann, like the hoax master Sacha Baron Cohen, actually paid them in cash then and there to head off any future legal comeback. Were they perhaps told that these “audition” scenes were going to be on the DVD extras? Or even form part of a larger, experimentalist adaptation? Maybe. Beckermann could have been a little more transparent with us about her working practices, but her anatomy of male fantasy is candid and apt.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotion Mutzenbacher is available from 29 September on True Story."
End of Term review – art-school horror is fusion of slasher and country-house whodunnit,"Weird goings-on in a basement lead to Cluedo-ish suspects and piecemeal flashbacks, but here it is the audience that suffers in the name of art",2,"‘So, you call yourself conceptualists, do you?” says the straight-arrow detective quizzing Melissa (Chelsea Edge), a cool-customer art student with three long lacerations on her face. “Mostly. Ashley wasn’t,” Melissa replies. “Unless anti-conceptualism is a concept. She was always about being in the moment. Expressionism. Impressionism.” End of Term has a fondness for bandying around the art-theory big talk, but this silly but stolidly genre project could sorely use a conceptual cutting edge itself.Melissa is getting questioned after being found strapped to a chair in the blood-splattered basement of Ford Barrington art school. Strangely, there are no bodies – except for that of snooty art critic Damian Self (Ronald Pickup) in the nearby space for the students’ end-of-term exhibition. In Usual Suspects-style piecemeal flashbacks, Melissa fills in the police on the buildup to the butchery and the halls of residence gallery of Cluedo-ish suspects, including her vampish one-time lover Ashley (Nicole Posener), the suave Professor Leigh (Peter Davison, a former Doctor in Doctor Who), and wild card Garth Stroman (Ivan Kaye), a rumoured ghost of a Byronic artist obsessed with a credo that art must involve pain.Director Mat Menony’s fusion of country-house whodunnit and slasher flick is campy without sparking much excitement. There is barely any heat in the flurry of bitching and bedhopping that serves as preamble, the dialogue is trite across the board, and there is a will-this-do? quality to the featured artwork. Fictional works of art are notoriously hard to pull off, but the ludicrous S&M chair – which proclaims “see no evil” to the occupant while jabbing at their eye cavities – won’t be bothering the Turner prize.Critically, we never find out Melissa’s artistic principles either: instead, she serves mechanically as the sullen narrator of this avant gardists’ pantomime. Milking the inane artsploitation angle – with Stroman hellbent on achieving his grisly magnus opus Incruxiatis Veritas – would have been fine if the film were not so stilted and drawn out. The artist has to suffer, says the hoary revenant, but End of Term didn’t have to inflict it on the audience too. End of Term is available on digital platforms on 2 October."
Carlos: The Santana Journey review – profile of guitar hero very much in control,"Santana comes across pretty well, if clearly in charge of his image, but Rudy Valdez’s film feels a bit like a Wikipedia entry with added pictures",3,"For those only passingly interested in the subject, this resolutely adequate portrait of guitarist Carlos Santana is the cinematic equivalent of a well-written and factchecked Wikipedia page but with loads more pictures and film clips. Hardcore fans may feel better served by the deep dive into Santana’s childhood and youth in Mexico, followed by his breakthrough into the San Francisco psychedelic music scene, and then on to that career-making performance at Woodstock in 1969. Forgive me if you have heard this one before, but Santana supposedly dropped acid given to him by Jerry Garcia from the Grateful Dead, expecting he would have hours to come down before his band, named after him, had to go on and play. Instead, they were called on stage soon after. The weird faces Santana can be seen making in the immortal documentary of the festival are apparently a result of him thinking that the neck of his guitar was a snake that he had to wrestle into musical submission. Those were the days.After the hit albums and huge tours of the 1970s, the story gets a bit duller – as most of these stories do. The narrative takes in the inevitable dissolution of the first marriage, the low times and then the comeback when Santana shifted musical direction a bit. As a documentary subject, albeit one clearly very much in control of his image here and not about to let the film-makers show him in anything but a flattering light, he comes across pretty well: articulate, still vain enough to have himself filmed shirtless, but grounded by strong family ties. That said, two of his sisters are interviewed and you can tell by their postures and hesitancies that they are holding back massive resentments.Indeed, it is not clear how interested director Rudy Valdez is in Santana, or whether he is just doing this gig as a means to an end. Valdez’s filmography is filled with works that sound a lot more hard-hitting and social justice-oriented than this behind-the-music fluff. Even so, Valdez gets the job done, laying down a constant soundtrack of Santana’s music in the background that (to be honest) sounds like variations on the same theme over and over again at slightly different speeds. No mention is made of the most controversial thing Santana has done recently, which was to say on stage that transgender people should stay “in the closet”, remarks for which he has since apologised. Carlos: The Santana Journey is showing on 23 and 27 September in UK and Irish cinemas."
Cats of Malta review – purr-inducing documentary aims to encourage compassion,"Interviewing the humans who help strays in their Maltese neighbourhood, this is a hazy but enjoyable slice of life with cats",3,"Social media, for all its sins, has achieved at least one thing in this crazy, mixed-up world: it’s raised everyone’s game when it comes to cat videos. What artist Louis Wain did for cat illustration in the 19th century, YouTube, Instagram and TikTok have done for our feline friends in the 21st, celebrating their strangeness, comic absurdity, and capacity for grumpiness. Meanwhile, there’s a growing genre of documentary films about cats and their relationship with humans, some of which add to the cat-people Venn-diagram-overlap an extra subset concerned with specific places, such as the magnificent Kedi, which profiled the street cats of Istanbul and their human friends.Cats of Malta, as its unambiguous title suggests, wants to do for Malta what Kedi did for Istanbul. It celebrates these very territorial creatures that share the streets of ancient neighbourhoods, with their history recounted by director Sarah Jayne’s voiceover. The cats are mostly unconcerned with the human residents except when they have needs to be met, such as hunger or medical emergencies. And so we get stories told straight to camera by kindly humans who had to help when, for example, an aggressive kick by a passing dog owner ended up costing one tom a front leg. Another person created a little cat village next to a historic stretch of wall built by the Knights Templar – a lovely conjunction of antiquity and super-tacky plastic cat shelters – but was forced to take it down by developers with plans for the site. Many of the humans, including the cat-village builder, English-Maltese actor Polly Marsh and 13-year-old natural comic Isaac Muscat, voluntarily spend huge chunks of their free time feeding the cats. They also, when possible, trap them so that they can be neutered or spayed, thus reducing the feral population.Most of the subjects talk about how much the cats give back by, for example, helping people lower their heart rates and blood pressure through relaxing cuddles, as if any cat fan watching this needed to be persuaded. There’s a proselytising quality at times that may baffle already-converted viewers but perhaps the film-makers are trying to persuade less pro-cat members of the audience to be more compassionate. Indeed, the film’s tone and purpose are a little hazy at times, making this not as satisfying as spending a good hour browsing cat memes, but it is still soft, fuzzy and purr-inducing. Also there’s a fantastic bit where a cat, captured in a cage to visit the vet, makes a meow that basically sounds like he’s saying “No! No!” Genuinely hilarious. Cats of Malta is released on 25 September on digital platforms."
The Lesson review – amusing but contrived literary thriller about family tragedy and vengeful ambition,"A charismatic young tutor comes to help a tragedy-stuck family in a bookish drama that’s fun and smart, but not entirely convincing",3,"Here is a brittle and contrived but rather elegant Brit thriller about literary paranoia from debut feature screenwriter Alex MacKeith and director Alice Troughton, herself a cinema first-timer having had much acclaim working on TV. The upscale and sophisticated mise-en-scène is rather French; Julie Delpy has a role here and looks quite at home.Richard E Grant plays JM Sinclair, a bestselling, sharp-tongued author who gives roguish interviews repeating the old maxim that good artists borrow but great ones steal. He is married to art collector Hélène (Delpy) and they live in a handsome country estate with extensive grounds and a lake. But Sinclair, usually so prolific, has retreated to a haunted creative silence following the tragic death of his elder son; the parents are now concerned with moody and mercurial younger boy Bertie (Stephen McMillan) who needs to be coached to get a place at Oxford to read English.And so they engage a live-in tutor to give lessons: this is Liam (Daryl McCormack), whose charm engages his employers. Liam finds himself having dinner with the family wearing borrowed clothes belonging to the dead son. But more painfully still, Liam admires Sinclair because he is a would-be author himself, and tremulously shows him his first novel in manuscript – with calamitous results.I enjoyed the “lesson” scenes here, especially when Liam has to provide a reading list. (My reading list for this film would be: John Colapinto’s About the Author, Jean Hanff Korelitz’s The Plot, Rebecca F Kuang’s Yellowface and James Hadley Chase’s Eve.) As for McCormack, he has the same screen presence he showed playing opposite Emma Thompson in the comedy Good Luck to You, Leo Grande – a not dissimilar role, in fact. Yet here he has to be angry, vengeful and infatuated, and the role certainly tests his emotional range pretty severely. Well, it’s hard not to be upstaged when matched with Richard E Grant in full flight. An amusing essay in conceit and revenge. The Lesson is released on 22 September in UK cinemas."
It Lives Inside review – standard-issue schlock horror has its moments,This Indian American monster movie has interesting touches of cultural specificity but it’s a mostly familiar formula,3,"There’s a swirl of the old and the new in the hokey pre-Halloween horror It Lives Inside, a balance that could have benefited from a lot more of the latter – because when the first-time director Bishal Dutta does try to add freshness to the familiarity of formula, he manages to carve his film its own place within two overstuffed subgenres, flashes of intrigue as he veers between schlocky curse and even schlockier monster movie.A wide-releasing horror film centered on an Indian American teenager already gives the film a certain distinction. Dutta, also acting as writer, tries to thread themes of assimilation and identity through a predictable procession of mostly ineffective jump scares and slightly more effective set pieces, the film working better when it’s trying to chill rather than shock. Never Have I Ever and Missing’s Megan Suri plays Samidha, or Sam as she prefers to be called, a girl trying to fit in at a predominantly white high school despite her mother keenly trying to keep traditions an integral part of her life. It’s led to a distance from her other Indian American friend, Tamira and, like Heathers and Fright Night before it, explores that interesting fracture of leaving one friend behind to climb higher socially.Tamira’s increasingly strange behaviour both unsettles and annoys Sam, as she skulks around unkempt and insistent that something sinister is afoot. But when she goes missing, it’s clear that she was right about a curse that attaches itself to those with a certain heritage.It’s a demonic spirit called a Pishach, one that appears in Hindu mythology, but one that’s ultimately a variation on something that’s appeared in a multitude of horror films before. It sticks to the dark, feeds on both flesh and fear and haunts the nightmares of those next in line. When the creature is kept to mostly sound design, as unoriginal as the noises may be, it’s a far more successful spectre. But as is frequently the case, the more we see, the less we want to and when we get the full picture, it most closely resembles the ill-advised human-alien hybrid from the end of Alien: Resurrection, snorts of derision cancelling out any screams.Telling a story of a flesh-eating demon but working with a PG-13 rating, the film is neutered from the outset but Dutta’s sleek, menacing atmosphere and efficient use of darkness almost make up for it, his film nothing if not a convincing audition tape for bigger genre work. His script might falter at times (Sam’s poor mother’s middle name may well be exposition) but it’s in the more specific moments that some character emerges, difficult and unanswered questions surrounding immigrant guilt and cultural reinvention adding much-needed texture to the more rote horror plotting.Some of Dutta’s of-the-moment metaphor horror might be blunt but it’s also, in some scenes, bluntly effective as well as effectively dour, his film climaxing with an unsurprising yet unnerving endnote. In the brief moments when It Lives Inside finds itself, there’s reason to believe Dutta will unearth more next time – he might just have to dig a little deeper.It Lives Inside is out in US cinemas on 22 September and in the UK on 20 October"
A Haunting in Venice review – Branagh improves on his Agatha Christie formula,"With smart casting and suitably murky Venice setting, the director improves on last year’s Death on the Nile, though his moustache-fondling Poirot remains the same",3,"The contrast between Kenneth Branagh’s latest Poirot adventure, the enjoyably spooky mystery A Haunting in Venice, and the synthetic fakery of the previous instalment, Death on the Nile, could be used as a case study of the power of casting to make or break a movie. The essential ingredients are the same: Agatha Christie source material; the timeworn formula of a murder or two in an impossibly lavish location, followed by a whole mess of conflicting motivations to untangle. Branagh brings exactly the same degree of prissy, moustache-fondling affectation to his performance as the Belgian master detective. But this time he smartly casts actors who are able to disappear into their characters – Tina Fey, with her staccato, typewriter line delivery as crime novelist Ariadne Oliver; Kelly Reilly’s silky, luxuriant sadness as celebrated singer Rowena Drake. Compare that with Nile’s distractingly starry cast of actors self-consciously wearing their roles: garish fancy dress costumes rather than characters.Another plus is the atmospheric Venice backdrop, its murky, swirling waters hinting at dark secrets that accumulate over centuries, like barnacles clinging doggedly to the buildings; its extravagant beauty framed slightly off-kilter. The story itself is fairly formulaic: Poirot is tempted by the opportunity to debunk Michelle Yeoh’s society medium at a Halloween seance, but soon finds himself sock-suspender-deep in bodies. It’s enjoyable, if familiar. A special mention should go to Jude Hill, the child actor who played Branagh’s younger self in Belfast and here shows impressive range with a deliciously unsettling turn as Leopold, the son of a shell-shocked and half-broken father."
Rally Road Racers review – animated-animal wacky races tries hard to be relatable,A slow loris hero longs to be a racing driver and his dreams take him everywhere from an a-ha video pastiche to a bewildering Brexit satire,2,"Most animated features are designed to be exported to countries all over the world, the voice track redubbed for each local market to add flavour and ensure the kids don’t have to read subtitles. Likewise, having the characters incarnated by talking animals (a tradition dating back to the earliest days of animation), is another handy way to deracialise the material. This way, anyone anywhere watching the same movie can relate to the heroic dog or rabbit or whoever as they go about learning about the value of family or the importance of friendship in a fantasy landscape that bears little resemblance to our actual planet.This one, apparently a multinational effort judging by its end credits and production companies, weirdly both conforms to and breaks those rules. Yes, all the characters in it are non-human animals, starting with the slow loris hero, Zhi (voiced by Jimmy O Yang) who longs to be a race-car driver despite resistance from his grandmother guardian (Lisa Lu) – she would prefer him to spend all day learning tai chi. The baddie is a frog racer named Archie Vainglorious (John Cleese, sounding husky these days), the key helper a goat named Gnash (JK Simmons, doing a very weird American-Swedish accent), and the love interest is another slow loris named Shelby (Chloe Bennet).So far, so traditionally anthropomorphic. But at the same time, there’s lots of discussion of Chinese and Asian heritage, what with the big race Zhi competes in being called the Silk Road Rally, a wacky race that ends in a cartoon facsimile of Shanghai. Elsewhere we have pregnant male seahorses with Italian accents, and some kind of weasel creature with a cockney accent who, when they’re trying to help Zhi beat Vainglorious, pulls a lever inside their vehicle labelled “Brexit” that releases, pointlessly, an avalanche of teapots to thwart those behind there vehicle.That last bit was one of the better jokes, while the other chuckles are mostly delivered via the patter from one of the peripheral characters, an Icelandic reindeer voiced by Catherine Tate. There’s also a well-drawn but narratively inexplicable spoof of the Norwegian band a-ha’s classic Take on Me video, although it’s doubtful any of the younger viewers will get the reference. This is very bizarre stuff, even within the traditionally weird parameters of cultural representation in cartoons, but kids won’t mind as it’s one non-stop riot of colour and vroom-vroom movement. This article was amended on 16 September 2023. The band a-ha are from Norway, not Sweden as an earlier version said. Rally Road Racers is released on 15 September in UK and Irish cinemas."
"Toronto film festival 2023 roundup – solidarity, swearing, swimming and one standout film","While a clutch of directorial debuts by actors mostly misfired, a return to form for Alexander Payne and award-worthy performances by Jamie Foxx and Jodie Comer offered plenty to get excited about",0,"Of all the autumn film festivals, Toronto was always going to be the one that stood to lose the most from the strikes that are paralysing much of the film industry. For a public-facing event that is justly famous for the rapturously enthusiastic audience response to its celebratory gala screening events, the absence of actors because of the Sag-Aftra union action would be particularly keenly felt. After all, without a sprinkling of stars, a red carpet is just an impractically coloured floor covering.There was speculation among those attending the festival that the unusually high number of films by actors turned directors this year was in part a strategy to circumvent the rules of the strike (unless an interim agreement has been put in place, actors are prevented from promoting their films, but no such restrictions are enforced for directors). The roster of these films included the feature-directing debuts of Chris Pine, Anna Kendrick, Kristin Scott Thomas and Patricia Arquette, plus features from more experienced actor-directors such as Taika Waititi (who won the audience prize, the People’s Choice, for Jojo Rabbit in 2019), Viggo Mortensen, Ethan Hawke and Michael Keaton.If indeed it was a strategy, it rather backfired. Interim agreements meant that Mortensen and star Vicky Krieps were able to attend to promote their film, the handsomely brooding frontier-set love story The Dead Don’t Hurt, and Hawke was in town to support his film, Wildcat, a formally daring exploration of the life and work of the writer Flannery O’Connor (flight cancellations forced Hawke to take an 11-hour Greyhound bus from New York to Toronto). But other film-makers stayed away in solidarity. And that’s before you even get to the wildly uneven quality of some of the other actor-turned-director offerings, with the pictures by Keaton, Arquette, Scott Thomas and Pine drawing less than enthusiastic responses from critics.The exception was the buzzy early festival standout Woman of the Hour, a deftly directed debut from Kendrick (who also stars) that announces her as a film-making talent to be reckoned with. Set in the early 1970s, the film takes as its jumping-off point a real event: the appearance of serial killer Rodney Alcala (Daniel Zovatto) on the popular TV show The Dating Game. Kendrick stars as Cheryl Bradshaw, the struggling actor who is convinced by her agent to take part in the show, and who finds herself trading innuendo-heavy televised small talk with a man who is later revealed to be a mass murderer and rapist. It’s a tonal challenge, but one to which Kendrick rises admirably.Sparks of increasingly bitter humour punctuate the growing sense of dread as Alcala charms his way out of suspicion. Cheryl, meanwhile, is adept at the daily microcalculations and dancing around the sensitive egos of the men she meets. The attention to period detail goes beyond the peppy colour palette and the flammable synthetics in the wardrobe, digging into the enraging sexual politics of the era.Another period picture that confronts the baked-in sexism of the time is the deliciously foul-mouthed and funny Wicked Little Letters, a 1920s-set tale about a spate of poison pen letters that rock the coastal community of Littlehampton, Sussex. Olivia Colman is the simpering, saintly recipient of the missives; Jessie Buckley is the rambunctious Irish single mum who is suspected of sending them. Both are an absolute blast in this terrific comedy.There were disappointments: The Critic, starring a venomous Ian McKellen as a monstrous theatre critic, started well but unravelled into chaos. And one of the hottest tickets of the festival, Hayao Miyazaki’s latest (and possibly last) animation, The Boy and the Heron, was sporadically charming and gorgeous, but also uneven and overplotted.Toronto has always been a launch pad for awards contenders, and this year was no exception. Expect Jamie Foxx to figure prominently in best actor conversations for his force-of-nature turn as showboating lawyer Willie E Gary in the crowd-pleasing courtroom drama The Burial. Both Annette Bening, who trained for more than a year to play the endurance swimmer Diana Nyad, and Jodie Foster, who brings heart and humour to the role of her best friend, Bonnie, should be in with a chance for the biopic Nyad, the narrative film debut of documentarians Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (Free Solo).But the serious contender in all categories, and by no small margin the best film of the festival, is The Holdovers, by Alexander Payne. It’s not just a return to form for the American director, whose last picture was the disappointing curio Downsizing in 2017. This 1970s-set comedy drama easily matches the very best films of Payne’s career. It explores the bond between a cantankerous teacher at an elite boarding school (Paul Giamatti) and an abrasive teenage student (Dominic Sessa) who is forced to spend the winter break at school.The treasures might have been fewer and further between this edition of the festival, in what can’t, by any stretch of the imagination, be considered a banner year. Ultimately, that makes gems such as The Holdovers all the more precious.Best filmAlexander Payne’s The Holdovers.Best lead performancesJamie Foxx’s charisma tsunami in the courtroom drama The Burial; Jodie Comer’s delicate, mesmerising turn in the dystopian survival film The End We Start From, from debut British director Mahalia Belo.Best supporting performancesDa’Vine Joy Randolph, devastatingly good in The Holdovers; Jodie Foster in the swimming biopic Nyad.Best newcomerDominic Sessa in The Holdovers.Longest introTaika Waititi performed a comedy routine, got into a punch-up with his microphone and invited a Native American elder on stage to perform a blessing before the premiere of Next Goal Wins.Longest queueThe line for the press screening of Hayao Miyazaki’s The Boy and the Heron stretched several blocks an hour before the film was due to start.Best swearingOlivia Colman and Jessie Buckley, turning the air blue in the 1920s-set comedy Wicked Little Letters."
The Royal Hotel review – feminist thriller starts strong but can’t stay the course,Julia Garner and Jessica Henwick are both impressive in an uneasy Australia-set film toying with genre expectations but tension dissipates in the finale,3,"The hoary sub-genre that is “attractive American tourists find something nefarious on their travels” is given a vigorous polish in thoughtful thriller The Royal Hotel, a film light on exploitation and heavy on interrogation.It’s an intriguing follow-up for writer-director Kitty Green, whose last film The Assistant was a simple yet stinging drama about a young woman, played by Julia Garner, working, and cleaning up, for a predatory Weinstein-like figure. Green’s approach to the subject was defter than most, an unusual way into a story most of us already knew far too much about, and there’s a similar sensitivity here for the most part, grounding a potentially schlocky situation. Garner returns as Hanna, joined by Glass Onion’s Jessica Henwick as Liv, two women running out of money on their travels in Australia, forced to take whatever work is available. Their only option is a pub in a remote mining community, run by Hugo Weaving’s crotchety inebriate, with no wifi but plenty of horny locals.Green’s uneasy slow-burn as the two women smile off an escalation of misogynistic microaggressions, is rooted and believable (it’s loosely based on a 2017 documentary), a forced playfulness with their lairy clientele a necessary tool of survival. It’s a perceptive look at the realities of working at a service job as an outsider when class and gender come into play, and the difficulties of performance that then leads to, an impossible modulation, role-playing on a knife-edge. The two British women who came before them, drunkenly passing the baton, show a more permissive attitude, playing along with a brash lack of sexual inhibition but the new pair are less comfortable with the dynamic, Hanna quickly painted as the party-pooper, a tiresome procession of men just asking her to smile more.Despite the increasing ugliness of the situation, the script, from Green and Oscar Redding, avoids the broadest of strokes, showing us specific variations in the men they encounter, that trouble can come in many forms, some of it more tolerable yet all of it exhausting. It can also come in more initially deceptive packaging, such as Babyteeth star Luke Holland’s handsome flirt and one of the film’s most horribly well-orchestrated moments is an aborted alcohol-fueled sex scene with him and Garner, reminiscent of the one in the film adaptation of Cat Person. Both scenes carry uncomfortable and unfairly imbalanced questions – why am I here, is this my fault, what should I do, what do I owe someone, how do I get out safely – and it’s in these chillier moments that the film really gets under the skin.But like that film it also loses its power as it thunders towards a spotty finale, not quite as dramatically here, but the initial tension, of which there was so much, dissipates as the film struggles to figure out how far it should lean into its genre trappings. The decision-making becomes harder to justify, the circumstances become harder to believe and the final punch of an ending becomes impossible to buy, a bravura visual (the film looks sensational throughout) but one that would only make sense had the film really gone full thriller. Garner and Henwick are never anything less than convincing, the latter especially, and the film is often at its most interesting when exploring the tiring dynamic of being the responsible friend. I’d argue the last act could have benefited from more of this knottiness but it’s more texture than one would usually find in a film such as this.It’s this trap though that becomes a blessing and curse, the film so much better than most ‘tourists find trouble abroad’ horrors yet at times thinner and less believable than a drama in the same setting. It’s everything and nothing at once although for a while, it’s really something.The Royal Hotel is screening at the Toronto film festival and will be out in US cinemas on 6 October"
Rustin review – Colman Domingo shines in by-the-numbers civil rights biopic,"Story of Bayard Rustin, an often unsung Black queer man who fought alongside Martin Luther King, is adapted into a rousing, if creaky, drama",3,"We’re in the middle of this year’s fall festival season which also means that we’re starting this year’s Oscar season which, as ever, then means that we’re in the thick of the dreaded biopic season. Films about Priscilla Presley, Leonard Bernstein, Enzo Ferrari, Nicholas Winton and Lee Miller are all trying to add fresh dynamism to the facts and figures of biographies, a practice that more often than not, feels rather thankless. Or at least it does to us as viewers. Academy members and actors trying to impress Academy members might disagree, the last decade offering up 15 acting Oscars to those playing dress-up as real people.What marks Netflix’s Oscar play Rustin out, at least on initial scan, is its focus on the kind of person who isn’t usually afforded a place in this particular spotlight, a gay Black man whose story hasn’t trickled down to as many of us as it should have. Even at the time, in the fraught early 60s, the life and work of Bayard Rustin was being diminished, his contributions too often outweighed by bigotry over his sexuality. Played by Colman Domingo, an actor finally receiving his leading man due, Rustin is a tireless activist, fighting alongside his close friend Martin Luther King Jr (a note-perfect Aml Ameen). But childish rumours about their relationship, started and maintained by their peers, led to public controversy and a rift in their friendship.Hurt by what he sees as a betrayal by his friend but still plagued by the grim cycle of anti-Black violence of the time, Rustin wanted to make a statement, with or without King’s help, and decided to plan a march, uniting those from across the country who were as tired as he, descending on the Capitol in their thousands. The film follows his dogged journey to make it happen, in the space of mere weeks, as others within the movement continue to undermine him.While an increasing number of writers and film-makers are arming themselves with a hyper-awareness of the biopic’s cliches and pitfalls, trying to upend expectations with unexpected tweaks, the makers of Rustin are content to stay within strict formula. It’s understandable for the most part, given how little many know of Rustin’s work, but at other times it can give the film a parodic quality (not helped by the distracting appearance of Chris Rock as Roy Wilkins). Julian Breece and Dustin Lance Black’s ho-hum screenplay relies a little too heavily on clumsy exposition and there’s an inconsistent and distracting choice to add names and job titles of characters on screen as they’re introduced. It’s also not helped by the static quality of George C Wolfe’s direction and that, coupled with the trademark Netflix cheapness, gives some of it the feeling of a History Channel re-enactment.It’s when the script leans into the story’s specificities that the film is at its most compelling – when intersectionality causes ruptures within the group, when we see civil rights giants fail to understand the hypocrisy of their homophobic bigotry, how Rustin manages his queerness in public and in private – and these moments help to provide depth to some of the flatness that’s in the more standard-issue scenes. Even when the film is playing it as safe as can be, the bare bones of the story are so undeniably impressive that it’s hard not to feel moved by what was achieved, a feeling that’s also largely down to Domingo’s all-guns-blazing performance. He nails the charming persuasiveness that would explain how Rustin achieved so much in such a short amount of time and as he slowly starts to experience a level of acceptance for his whole self, rather than handpicked parts, there’s a genuine poignancy to watching him crumble in front of us, a weight we can feel being lifted away.While the scale of the big finale is hampered by budgetary constraints, it’s an effectively stirring endnote regardless, even if it might be Domingo’s hand pulling the strings. Rustin screened at the Toronto film festival; it is released in US and UK cinemas on 3 November, and on Netflix on 17 November."
Elevator Game review – viral-challenge horror takes lift to another world,"Riffing on a decade-old viral challenge, a group of vloggers set off to a high-rise where supernatural peril supposedly awaits",2,"Inspired by an online challenge that went viral nearly a decade ago, Rebekah McKendry’s second feature feels out of date from start to finish. The central game is simple: one must enter the lift of a 10-floor building and proceed to travel in a specific sequence through a series of floors, the last of which supposedly opens a portal to a dangerous parallel world. The trick here is to close your eyes, or risk being torn to pieces by a mysterious apparition referred to as “the woman on the fifth floor”.Such a scenario is ripe with potential for world-building details and creative designs, but there is little visual flair on show here. A group of popular vloggers head to a notorious lift where a girl has gone missing after attempting the perilous challenge, but the generic location is as inspiring and memorable as a doctor’s waiting room. Mentions of TikTok accounts suggest that Elevator Game takes place in the present, yet the vloggers are lugging huge shoulder camcorders about as if it’s two decades ago. Plastered with sepia-toned filters and juvenile sound effects, the snippets of these characters’ supposedly popular videos betray a lack of awareness of current online culture. It is no wonder that the dialogue rings so stilted, like a parody of how older writers imagine Gen Z-ers speak.Cardboard characters aside, Elevator Game is also pretty sluggish, despite its relatively short runtime. Plodding through an endless string of dull shot/reverse shots between the quarrelling vloggers, the film finally reaches the dreaded fifth floor, but the payoff is tame and bloodless. With a bit with red lighting and a few jumpscares, this much-discussed other realm – and consequently the movie as a whole – are, ultimately, hardly worth the fuss. Elevator Game is available from 15 September on Shudder."
Bolan’s Shoes review – Timothy Spall and Leanne Best add class to trauma drama,"Separated siblings, bullied children, horrible accidents and Marc Bolan’s death are only some of the tragedies here, but strong performances keep the horrors watchable",3,"This Wales, Liverpool and London-set drama is a proper melodrama any way you slice it, but one with strong enough performances and sufficiently good dialogue to keep it from feeling tacky. The first chunk of expository scene-setting shuttles back and forth between the 1970s and the present day, establishing a sunny comic tone that’s suddenly pierced by tragedy. In the 70s, a coachload of kids from a children’s home are travelling to see their favourite band, T Rex, chaperoned by the home’s vicar (Andrew Lancel) and cheery carer Simon (Louis Emerick, forever lovable Mick from Brookside). The vicar’s daughter Penny (Eden Beach), about 10 years old, is close with home-resident Sadie (Amelia Rose Smith) and Sadie’s shy older brother Jimmy (Isaac Lancel-Watkinson), who is bullied by the older boys. The coach ends up crashing, killing several people. Meanwhile, in the present, adult Penny (Leanne Best, so good you wonder why she’s not had more leading roles instead of support turns) is now married to local vicar Geraint (Mark Lewis Jones) and is excitedly preparing to make her annual pilgrimage from Anglesey to London to pay respects at the grave of T Rex’s lead singer, Marc Bolan, whom the kids all met back in the 1970s timeline.However, at the graveside where many T Rex fans have gathered, Penny notices a withdrawn man (Timothy Spall, for it is he) with long hair and a huge beard, blowing massive bubbles for entertainment. He has an epileptic fit; of course, it transpires that this is Jimmy, who years earlier was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and these days lives in a ramshackle mobile home in the woods. He hasn’t been in a good way ever since the aforementioned tragedy back in the 1970s. Once he and Penny are reunited, all that walled-up pain, guilt and shame comes out in a flood of long-kept secrets, most of them revealed in a long, movingly delivered monologue from Penny. So persuasive is Best’s performance that you almost don’t notice writer-director Ian Puleston-Davies stacks the revelation of yet another tragic horror atop the pile – as if separated siblings, secret identities, bullied children in care, horrible accidents and Bolan’s death weren’t enough.The happy-ish ending doesn’t feel entirely persuasive but it’s just about forgivable, and Spall is every bit as good as Best in a role that many other actors might have hammed up with broader gestures and mannerisms. Instead, Spall keeps the performance tight, projecting not just Jimmy’s damaged psyche but also his wit. You can’t help but chuckle when he mentions he spent a lot of time in Bristol: “Lovely city, shame about the slavery.” Bolan’s Shoes is released on 15 September in UK and Irish cinemas."
Dark Asset review – ambitious super-soldier cyborg thriller goes hard on flashback,"This film can’t decide if it’s an action thriller or a steamy character study, as a soldier with an enhanced-abilities chip chats up a woman in a bar",2,"John Wick has probably created unrealistic expectations for the adrenaline levels to be encountered in luxury hospitality venues, and this low-budget super-soldier thriller, largely narrated over cocktails in a swanky hotel lobby, follows firmly in its gold-card wake. But the generic and strangely pointless tech conspiracy on offer here supplies as memorable an experience as a branch of the average Hilton. And despite its attempts to juice up its cyborg setup with some old-fashioned body heat, Dark Asset ends up more smarmy than sexy.Former special forces soldier (Byron Mann) is fitted out with a cybernetic enhancement chip and a John Doe moniker, the latest recruit in an experimental programme. Once the chip has been activated by boffin Dr Cain (Robert Patrick, who has acquired fiendish eyebrows since his Terminator 2 days), he has access to enhanced cognitive and physiological abilities. But the hardware malfunctions, and John busts out of the secure facility and heads not for the nearest casino (surprisingly given his card-divining capability), but to a hotel where he cracks on to Jane (Helena Mattsson) and insists he has quite the tale to tell.Never mind the bodyhacking, this combination of action thriller and Scheherazade-style raconteuring is an unstable hybrid as John proceeds to recount the stories of the enhanced operatives who came before him. It’s admirably ambitious on the part of writer-director Michael Winnick, but the two approaches are fundamentally at odds with each other; the nested narratives sap the relentless forward momentum needed, and the individual flashbacks are not compelling enough set-pieces on either the action or character front. The tricksy structure needs greater intrigue to justify it, but with the programme apparently being at the behest of a cabal of anonymous businessmen, it’s not even as fleshed-out as Universal Soldier.Mann does look fantastic – lean and dapper – but his chip appears to be malfunctioning in his scenes opposite Mattsson; a smug grin is virtually his only facial expression. Both leads also consistently opt for the “cheesy dialogue” option in their head-up displays. Dark Asset finally finds a semi-satisfying groove as John’s grand design is revealed, even if it consists of too many borrowed parts to be a real quantum leap. Dark Asset is available on digital platforms on 18 September."
One Life review – Anthony Hopkins moves in stirring second world war drama,"The two-time Oscar winner makes a convincing play for a third statuette in the powerful story of Nicholas Winton, who saved Jewish children before the war began",3,"It seems strange that an actor of Anthony Hopkins’ prestige and acclaim would need a comeback so late in his career but for a few years, the Oscar-winner was stuck in a cycle of thankless sequel paycheques and one-word thrillers where the “and” credit was starting to lose its lustre (Collide! Solace! Misconduct! Blackway!). Within the space of a year he was then Oscar nominated for The Two Popes and won for The Father (his first Academy attention since 1998) and while it didn’t exactly curb his predilection for B-movies completely (in 2021 he started in Zero Contact, the first film to be released by an NFT platform), it did edge him back toward substance, with a subtle yet scene-devouring turn in James Gray’s Armageddon Time and now, another knockout performance in the second world war drama One Life.The film might, at times, feel more like a BBC TV drama (it does come from BBC Films among others) with some pedestrian film-making touches but it builds towards a last act of towering emotion, with few dry eyes at its Toronto film festival premiere. It’s a story of radical bravery, of Nicholas Winton, a stockbroker gripped by a need to do something as Europe neared the start of the second world war. He headed to Prague in 1938, despite the cautions of his well-intentioned mother, and found himself immediately horrified by the situation so many of the young refugees were in, most unlikely to survive the winter. His plan to save them was dismissed as naive by those more hardened by what they had seen and what they had found not to be possible but he returned to London determined to help and with the assistance of his equally dogged mother, he started gathering visas and finding homes.We see his work play out via flashbacks as the elder Winton sorts through files and papers he’s long been hoarding, much to the chagrin of his wife. Played by Johnny Flynn as a youth, he’s a man driven by an unstoppable need to help and as his older self, played by Hopkins, he’s a man haunted by never helping enough. Embarrassed by the idea of demanding attention for what he had done, he learned to almost bury it, telling himself that anyone would have acted in the same way and that thinking too much about it would cause him to focus on those who were left behind.It’s an involving back-and-forth through time but in the scenes from the late 30s, small screen director James Hawes often struggles to visually distinguish his film from so many second world war dramas that have come before, reverting to the safety of his TV roots. Flynn is a convincingly obsessive problem-solver, with help from a steely Romola Garai in Prague (someone please give her a legal procedural already) and a tenacious Helena Bonham-Carter as his mother in London, and there’s an undeniable wrench from the familiar yet poignant images of little hands waving goodbye to parents they’re never going to see again. But it’s in the scenes from the late 80s, which slowly start to take centre stage, that the film finds more original footing, exploring with nuance the realities of living with the weight of doing so much yet thinking of it as so little.Winton’s monumental accomplishment was kept hidden for years, buried away in a leather briefcase in his home, and as he slowly tries to find a way to share the documents that detail what he did (for historical and educational purposes rather than for anything involving his ego), his life and self-perception start to shift. It’s in these latter scenes, as Winton confronts his innate goodness and realises the weight of what he’s done, that the film truly soars. Key moments take place at recordings of BBC’s That’s Life, a show his wife laughs off as tacky, but there’s something about its unashamed sentimentality that starts to have an effect, suddenly hitting us as it does Hopkins, whose display of unearthed emotion is rather shattering, a man never thinking of himself as good enough finally realising he’s better than most of us. It’s a last act that brought down the house here in Toronto and will likely do the same upon release.One Life is screening at the Toronto film festival and will be released in the UK on 5 January with a US release to be announced"
Christian Marclay: Doors review – spellbinding entrances and exits,"White Cube Mason’s Yard, LondonIn the manner of his acclaimed work The Clock, and 10 years in the making, the Swiss-American artist has spliced together hundreds of film clips to create an extraordinary montage of cinematic comings and goings",4,"A door bursts open, a man hurtles across the screen, overturning a table in pursuit of some vanishing figure. A door bursts open, and a woman slams it hard against whoever is chasing behind her. A door opens more slowly, a face peering anxiously round it, eyes widening with astonishment. Just as you are about to see who or what they saw, the door closes with a click. A key turns sharply in the lock.Swiss-American artist Christian Marclay’s Doors is all revelation and drama. For almost an hour, the viewer sits spellbound in a darkened cinema specially created for the film’s UK premiere at White Cube, watching a nonstop onslaught of entrances and exits. Clip after clip, selected from hundreds of movies, appears on the big screen in an extraordinary feat of choreography and collage. Somehow, it seems as if each is directly connected to the next, no matter that they shift between monochrome and colour, and all the way from silent films to French New Wave and Hollywood blockbuster.Ingrid Bergman, Sidney Poitier, Bette Davis, Bill Murray – they arrive and they depart, every time through a door. John Wayne saunters in, with a searching look, Robert Mitchum rushes angrily through, John Travolta breaks out into the night through the exit.Each door marks an edit point, and every edit is so deft that the actors always appear to be on their way to the very next scene. One door opens and a new film begins. Mia Farrow looks through a keyhole, in Rosemary’s Baby, and what she sees is a nightmare from a completely different movie. Rita Hayworth, in glamorous gown, goes to answer the door and it opens into another film.A double locking of the door is shown in Hitchcockian closeup. Or a door being slyly locked with the use of a blade, so that it does not appear is if anyone’s broken in. A door swings open to reveal a gift left inside an apartment. It creaks, opens of its own accord, slams alarmingly shut. No actors are needed when the door has become the protagonist.Suddenly you notice the same scene reappearing: perhaps this is where you came in, and Marclay’s film is beginning again? But then the scene turns out to be very slightly longer, offering fractionally more narrative, before it cedes to the next clip. This creates a pleasingly piquant unease for audiences used to watching art films on loop. For this is by no means the end.Marclay (born 1955) is famous for his timing, specifically for 2010’s The Clock, featuring watches, clocks and characters reacting to them in thousands of collaged clips. That 24-hour wonderwork was synchronised to real time in the many museums where it was shown, so that when Robert De Niro checked his Rolex at 2.03pm, it really was 2.03pm. The viewer was outside time, watching the film, and yet positioned within it, always reminded of its ticking reality on the screen.Those refined calculations extend to sound here too; each door opens into a new space and time, but also into a new soundscape. Heavy breathing merges into panting, dramatic music into screaming violins, which cross-fade with storms. You soon realise, too, that film-makers rarely show a door closing when they can imply it through sound instead.Marclay’s film exceeds the encyclopedic labours of its own making in every respect. Even as it crystallises the role of doors in cinema – all the ways they are used to begin or end a scene, to ratchet suspense, or orchestrate rhythm – so it builds into its own self-contained movie per se. Ten years in the making, its own rhythm is so subtle it seems to press forwards in perpetuity. The door never shuts, you might say.Marclay is a terrific manipulator of emotion and tension. His film moves through the ominous arrival of the doctor at the bedside or the lawyer at the prison cell, from the awful tension of a gradually opening door to the urgent wait for the lift doors to part with a view of safety (or its opposite) for a fleeing figure. Every clip is perfectly choreographed, and timed, to sustain our never-ending sense of anticipation.This exhibition also includes a series of new sculptures constructed from old doors. A door gnawed away to its frame, without panels or fittings: the ghost of a door, as it seems, or has it now become a window? An infinite column of lock panels that rises to the ceiling. The central architecture of a door, cut to a cross shape, so that it becomes a crucifix, the knocker where a human head might be.Best of all, in these “alterations”, as Marclay modestly calls them, is a horizontal stack of doors with fractional gaps between them. The irresistible impulse is to kneel down and peer through, like the child you have just seen in Marclay’s film, trying to understand the world by looking through a letterbox.Which is, in the end, what this marvellous show is about: not just doors in films, or even doors in reality, but the curious role of these curious and intermediary objects in our existence. Doors become newly emblematic in Marclay’s art. They speak of everyone who might come or go through them, every before and after, everything seen and unseen in some scenario or story. Above all, they stand for our constant desire to know what happens next. Christian Marclay: Doors is at White Cube Mason’s Yard, London, until 30 September"
Man on the Run review – fine documentary about a starstruck Malaysian financial scandal ,Cassius Michael Kim’s film tells the story of the man who financed Scorsese’s The Wolf of Wall Street with billions of dollars allegedly stolen from Malaysia’s poorest people,3,"Leonardo DiCaprio should get a supporting actor credit, so often is he namechecked in Cassius Michael Kim’s deft documentary about the brazen 1MDB Malaysian state fund scandal. Top billing goes to Jho Low, a Great Gatsby figure who, in cahoots with Goldman Sachs bankers and Malaysia’s former PM, is accused of swindling the country’s poorest out of some $1.42bn and is now on the run. He spent the money sucking up to Hollywood A-listers with lavish gifts and funding for the DiCaprio-starring movie The Wolf of Wall Street. Apt, since this documentary shares Scorsese’s theme of obscene greed, while Kuala Lumpur’s neon nightscape gives the feel of a Batman villain’s origin story. The Penguin, probably."
El Conde review – Pinochet rises from the dead in Pablo Larraín’s gothic horror,"The Chilean dictator returns as a vampire – and his family’s out for blood. But this alternative history, though entertaining, feels​ politically enigmatic",4,"After the ethereal, English-language Spencer, Chilean director Pablo Larraín returns home with this gothic monochrome alt-history, imagining murderous dictator General Pinochet as a 250-year-old vampire. Having faked his death, Pinochet (Jaime Vadell), AKA El Conde, is hiding out in the crumbling grandeur of his Patagonian lair, hoping for death. This end-of-life ennui is disturbed by his money-grubbing family, not-so-loyal servant (Alfredo Castro) and a comely accountant-nun (Paula Luchsinger).All are entertaining in turn, though none manages to drive a stake through the dark heart of Larraín’s often enigmatic political point. It’s down to the arch, instantly recognisable narration to really skewer crony-capitalism, while Larraín’s film demonstrates a palate for mordant humour as refined as the count’s taste for blood.On Netflix"
The Boy and the Heron review – Miyazaki’s last movie is a fitting swan song,The 82-year-old film-maker’s final animation might not be up there with his greatest but it’s a sweet and soulful goodbye,3,"Purported to be the master Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki’s last movie, maybe, The Boy and the Heron is a gentler and slower though no less soulful addition to his canon. The film, about a young boy slipping like so many Miyazaki protagonists to a world unencumbered by mortality, takes its time to get going. Meanwhile, it’s preoccupied with those who have no time left.It’s a fittingly solemn swan song for the 82-year-old film-maker who – with films like My Neighbor Totoro and Spirited Away – has taken us to magical worlds where human and animal anatomies are free to make exchanges while industry and nature become harmonious in ungodly ways. The catbus in Totoro always struck me as a cuddly response to a Cronenberg monster.The Boy and the Heron, the director’s first feature since he last retired with 2013’s The Wind Rises, has all the Miyazaki hallmarks: the anthropomorphic animals, the tiny grannies with disproportionate facial features who can just as easily be magical creatures and a tempting food scene – animated jam looks ready to drip off the screen. Miyazaki has few surprises left, but in The Boy and the Heron, it’s the familiar that feels like a comforting hug.The film is already a box office hit in Japan, where it was released in July with no advance promotion – as if in secret. The Japanese title is How Do You Live?, taken from Genzaburo Yoshino’s 1937 novel. Yohino’s book appears in The Boy and The Heron, a text the film’s young protagonist Mahito (Soma Santoki), who is somewhat inspired by Miyazaki himself, picks up and reads during a pivotal moment.The film gets going with an evocative, harrowing and dream-like cold open. Sirens breaking the silence at the dead of night before ashes and embers float into the frame. It’s the second world war. A Tokyo hospital has been firebombed and Mahito realizes his mother is on shift. The frame captures his mad scramble to the hospital – legs flurrying like a spider’s – against the chilling stillness of the background. He arrives at a vision perhaps more spiritual than literal, as fire tears at his mother’s flesh, or at least peels at the ink that makes up her animated skin. What could be a horrifying sight is made comforting, as she’s not consumed by the flames so much as she becomes one with them.A few years after the tragedy, Mahito moves to sprawling estate in the country, still crippled by grief. His father, who, like Miyazaki’s own, runs a factory producing aircraft parts, is newly married to his former sister-in-law, who is expecting. Mahito struggles to settle in, not even warming up to the squadron of excitable grannies scurrying around the property, fawning over corned beef and canned salmon imported from the city, or that heron that creates a nuisance by the window.The film lingers aimlessly here, completely unhurried, as if patience building while letting us sit in Mahito’s grief. Miyazaki tends to make movies about strong, fiery female characters, the types who appear in smaller roles in The Boy and the Heron. Mahito, the rare male protagonist, is purposefully lifeless, his glazed-over reserve keeps things emotionally cold. Only the mischievous granny keeping things amusing alongside that pesky heron, with human teeth and gums garishly protruding from its beak as it beckons towards something beyond.Eventually Mahito is tempted to search for his late mother in a tower protruding from the earth, which is a portal to the alternate worlds we sign up for in Miyazaki films. There we find a shipwreck so overgrown with moss and fern it has become an inhabited island that hosts a whole circle of life. A Moby Dick-sized catfish is gutted and consumed by little pillowy white creatures called warawara. They will transcend and become people in another dimension, if they’re not first mauled by starving pelicans. As usual for Miyazaki, the graceful and grotesque are mere brush strokes apart.Miyazaki has explored grief and the afterlife in the past. He’s a film-maker that has been both haunted and at peace with such thoughts throughout his whole career, which is perhaps why every film is positioned as though it’s his last.The Boy and The Heron is no exception. Though this is an uncommonly mature and joyous meditation on death and legacy, one that paints death as a new beginning, a transition to another time and place, where nothing actual seems final. For a film-maker like Miyazaki, that’s the perfect note to go out on.The Boy and the Heron is screening at the Toronto film festival and will be released in the US on 8 December with a UK date to be announced"
North Star review – Kristin Scott Thomas makes a ho-hum directorial debut,There are impressive performances from Sienna Miller and Emily Beecham but this comedy drama of sisters coming together for a wedding is forgettable,2,"This year’s unusual fall festival season, almost entirely devoid of stars and missing some notable big titles, continues with a hushed kick-off for Toronto, a red carpet rolled out but left mostly untrodden. It was as muted inside as it was outside for the premiere of North Star, a rather underwhelming family drama that marks the directorial debut of Kristin Scott Thomas, an actor who one can never see enough of in front of the camera but one who hasn’t quite proved her worth behind it just yet, her film never deserving anything more than a shrug.Not that her low-key story of sisters reuniting for their mother’s wedding was ever intended to grab us by the shoulders – it’s far too gentle for that – but it should at least carry with it a great deal more charm or character than it does, something that no amount of idyllic English countryside shots can fix. Using a key element of her own family history as well as the tone of her one-time colleague Richard Curtis, Scott Thomas has introduced herself as a mostly competent film-maker but as a screenwriter with important lessons to learn. Co-written with journalist John Micklethwait, North Star is a film that often finds an interesting or challenging idea, only to leave it unexplored or cast aside in the place of something drabber instead. It’s a soft-pedalled soap with stars who know and can do better.Scarlett Johansson plays a recently promoted navy captain, trying to balance a demanding job with her role as mother and partner to Freida Pinto’s frustrated girlfriend, Sienna Miller plays a Hollywood star, unable to maintain a marriage or long-term relationship and Emily Beecham plays a hard-working nurse who suspects her brash, boorish husband is cheating on her. They’re brought together at their family home to celebrate the third wedding of their mother, played by Scott Thomas, a reunion that causes them all to reflect on the hows and whys of where their lives are at. The key detail carried over from Scott Thomas’s life is that she lost both her father and stepfather to combat and in the film this weighs heavy on Johansson’s character especially, the loss haunting her as she both returns to the home and takes on a position that pays tribute to their legacies.But in her one major stylistic flourish as director, Scott Thomas decides to animate Johansson’s memories, a disastrously twee and ineffective decision that sucks any emotive power from her flashbacks. Perhaps the argument would be made that the cutesy Raymond Briggs-esque sojourns are meant to show how one’s memory can be unreliably rose-tinted and unfairly gendered (one of the film’s more alluring half-ideas) but they’re distractingly out-of-place, not helped by Johansson being the weakest link of the three, struggling with an awkward British accent and confusing stiffness for stoicism. Miller and Beecham are both excellent, the former’s comic delivery elevating some of her ho-hum dialogue, and the latter almost convincing us that she’s playing a real person, even when the script forced her into laughably far-fetched diversions.We’re never quite sure how seriously we’re supposed to take North Star, as either grounded family drama or knockabout sitcom, with bursts of cartoonishly absurd comedy (a silly subplot involving a detective trying to ensnare a cheater crescendoes with a bizarrely bawdy reveal) blunting the impact of the graver, talkier scenes surrounding (a tonal balance that Curtis managed so effortlessly). The film never really nails the long, lived-in history of a sibling dynamic with specific detail kept at a minimum, never cutting quite as close to the bone as it should and when shouty conflict does arrive in the last act, it’s triggered by a baffling, so-what revelation that’s too tame to make sense as the gas that finally causes a house fire. There’s a far more persuasive scene after with Scott Thomas giving herself a monologue filled with more nuance and thoughtfulness than the entirety of the film preceding it but it’s too little too late, a frustrating insight into what this could have become had it been made with a clearer idea of what it’s trying to be.In the murky sea of directorial debuts from established actors, there have been far, far worse attempts than North Star but it’s just too insubstantial to register as anything more than a footnote and definitely not enough to justify any drastic career change.North Star is screening at the Toronto film festival with a release date to be announced"
Jawan review – Shah Rukh Khan vehicle goes like a runaway train,"With flair, Khan plays a godly badass, dandyish army vet and a sweetheart with a prospective stepdaughter in an undisciplined showcase of his talents",3,"Chasing January’s crowdpleasing comeback Pathaan, here’s further confirmation of Shah Rukh Khan’s status as reigning, benevolent King of Bollywood. Where his earlier film expounded on established formula, Khan’s latest stretches its arms wider and demonstrates flickers of idiosyncratic vision. It is properly pan-Indian: the emergent Tamil action stylist Atlee imports South Indian cinema’s characteristic rowdiness and social conscience, alerting the mass audience to pressing regional concerns – before apparently losing control over his material. A star vehicle that functions like a runaway train, Jawan covers a lot of ground in surprising fashion at full throttle – but that’s also a polite way of admitting it’s utterly all over the place.Its surest organising principle is its lead actor, shuffling knowingly and wittily through a range of personas. From his opening line (“who am I?”), Khan draws us into wondering what relation the bandaged warrior liberating a village in a prologue has to the gruff baldie laying siege to Mumbai’s metro, and the prison warden clinging to a second chance at love. A one-man Cloud Atlas, Jawan is a puzzle movie where the star proves the puzzle; it’s a great showcase for Khan to play everything under the sun: godly badass, dandyish army vet, total sweetheart with a prospective stepdaughter. There’s ego involved, undeniably, but few stars in any cinema could model such radically diverse hats with this much flair.Less smooth are the moving parts around him, a whirlwind of ideas good, bad and flagrantly pilfered that suggests this project would have benefited from one script editor for every five Shah Rukhs. Atlee maintains a frenzied momentum, but he has to, lest we pause to consider the preposterous tosh this plot keeps pushing our way. Once our hero’s genesis is resolved, we’re left with another headscratcher: how a movie that features cinema’s lamest Matrix and Christopher Nolan allusions could also generate a tremendous stretch of highway-bound carnage, as thrilling as anything could Hollywood manage. Jawan will prove no more enduring than Pathaan in the Khan pantheon, but it’s a semi-fascinating display of star power, and a rollicking (if bumpy) Friday-night ride. Jawan is released on 7 September in cinemas."
Gonzo Girl review – Patricia Arquette’s directorial debut is a disappointment,"The actor makes an underwhelming first feature as film-maker, a thinly etched adaptation of Cheryl Della Pietra’s semi-autobiographical book",2,"There’s a certain image associated with gonzo journalism – daring, confessional, subversive, male. For all its successes and groundbreaking candor, it’s a style conflated with male ego and excess, the extremes of drugs, adventure and eccentricity that men could afford to pursue.Gonzo Girl, the directorial debut of the actor Patricia Arquette, seems, at least on the surface, to be interested in complicating that image, or at least adding some footnotes. The 107-minute film, written by Rebecca Thomas and Jessica Caldwell and based on the semi-autobiographical novel by Cheryl Della Pietra, focuses on a young female assistant to a stand-in for Hunter S Thompson in the summer of 1992. Like her real-life counterpart, Alley Russo (Camila Morrone) is a bookish recent grad with literary aspirations who takes a gig assisting a famous writer at his Colorado ranch. Like Thompson, Willem Dafoe’s Walter Reade is a titanic personality, an erratic live wire subsisting on booze, hallucinogens and elephantine amounts of coke (there’s enough bumps in this movie to rival Wolf of Wall Street).Tellingly, the film begins not with Alley but with Walter, as he conducts a typically volatile and combative reading in New York. Spring-loaded movements, rambling monologues, manic energy – it’s the type of role Dafoe can sink his teeth into, and he eats every scene. Which is a problem for a film that seems interested in the many female figures who support the reputation of singular genius, but has little interest in their lives outside of their relation to him. We get the barest sense of Alley’s personhood before the ranch, other than a clunky mention of needing money and wanting to write; she arrives shy and hesitant, but quickly adapts to the Walter Reade lifestyle – drugs, chaos, shooting guns and writing while high in an assemblage of poses and situations coded, either under his gaze or ours, as erotic.Alley’s task, as relayed by Walter’s longtime secretary/fixer Claudia (Arquette) is to keep the party going but steer Walter to the typewriter just enough to get some good pages to his editor in New York, lest the cashflow cease. Given the hangers-on, the coke, the partying (including with Ray Nicholson’s Larry, a Hollywood actor who pops in and out) and Walter’s insecure, equally erratic girlfriend Devaney (You’s Elizabeth Lail), this is more difficult than promised. Alley begins channeling her ambitions by keeping a journal about Walter, then by writing as Walter, doctoring up his pages when his lifestyle far outpaces his former ability.This amounts to a betrayal, though by the time it’s exposed, the relentless debauchery is too tiresome and the characterization too thin to really care, as if the existence of a lot of drugs, or a toxic kind-of mentor, is enough in itself to justify interest. Arquette’s direction outpaces the writing in this regard; the parties and drug trips are at least compellingly styled and shot, but there’s no sense of why Alley participates so willingly, why she’s charmed by Walter, why she continues to stay.There’s an online joke that Morrone, who managed to eke out some space in the messy ensemble that was Daisy Jones & the Six, has a face that’s seen Instagram, and Gonzo Girl does little to dispel that this is not 1992. Her role is, for the most part, more modeling than acting – a series of ever more sexy outfits that cater to Walter’s taste (maybe?), in various postures of ecstasy, focus or distress. As the film wears on and the walls close in on Walker (at least financially), she fades away from the story, more trope than character.More interesting is Claudia, a woman whose sweet, somewhat wearied affect masks a sinister, ice-cold self-protective streak – in other words, a typically Arquette creation. Towards the end, as Alley’s tolerance for Walter’s outbursts wanes, Claudia offers what seems to be the justification for all this mess on-screen: that every woman involved, every invisible secretary or assistant or girlfriend, gets some credit for the work, is responsible for some of the magic. It’s a shrug of a thesis on a skin-deep story. I’m certainly not against a movie of imperfect, messy feminism – women figuring out their own way in a crazy environment. But like Alley’s imitations of Walter’s prose, there’s a performative profundity to this inert tale of crossed boundaries, toxic bosses and dozens of lines.Gonzo Girl is screening at the Toronto film festival"
Coup de Chance review – Woody Allen’s tale of ill-fated lovers is his best film in a decade,Venice film festival: An adulterous affair between bored millionaire’s wife Fanny and struggling writer Alain is surely bound for disaster,3,"One autumn day in Paris, a struggling writer named Alain buys a lottery ticket for his married lover, Fanny. The purchase is made on impulse; it’s an offhand romantic gesture and a feeble appeal to the fates. The odds are stacked against these ill-starred lovers and their adulterous affair is surely bound for disaster. But the nights are drawing in and the only moment that counts is now. Being a writer, Alain has a tendency to quote poetry. He says, “We all get frozen in ice if we don’t act before winter comes.”Closing in on his 88th birthday, Woody Allen likewise appears to be running out of time. His creative juices have flatlined, scandal has made him a pariah, and the Venice organisers drew fierce condemnation for even including him on the programme. And yet, undeterred, he’s still rolling the dice on his musing tales about happenstance and happy accidents, relocating to Europe and working with French actors, like a failing gambler who hopes that a new casino might bring a change in his fortunes. Obviously the lotto ticket’s a bust; that was simply too much to ask. The real shock, though, is the film. It turns out to be the best one he’s managed in a decade at least.Fanny (Lou de Laâge), we’re told, was once a high-school bohemian. Now she’s wed to the odious Jean (Melvil Poupaud), a self-made millionaire whose chief passion is the train-set which occupies an entire room of their palatial home. She spends her time in posh auction rooms, attending cocktail receptions or hunting deer from the couple’s bucolic weekend retreat. Now, thanks to her dalliance with Alain (Niels Schneider), Fanny reconnects with a different (and woozily romanticised) side of Paris and starts browsing in second-hand bookshops and strolling through leaf-blown city parks. “My life would be so different if I hadn’t bumped into you on the street,” she declares. Inevitably, though, luck is not on their side. Boiling over with suspicion, Jean has already hired a private detective to trail his wife around town and it is at this point that the melancholic Coup de Chance prepares to jump the points and embark on a different, rather darker track.The strong, credible performances oil the wheels during these clattering shifts of gear and serve to distract from its occasional moments of implausibility. Implicitly, they also invite us to turn a blind eye to some minor continuity errors. Coup de Chance’s action spans six months or so and yet the whole production seems to have been shot in the month of October aside from a brief exterior shot of the country house, where we’re suddenly thrown forward to high summer. By this point in the action, a murder plot has been hatched and the shooting party is in full swing. Everybody involved seems to have slightly lost their bearings.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotionHow Allen continues to conduct his career is obviously his business alone. But if he were ever minded to collect his winnings and quit the table, his 50th feature might be a decent film to go out on. Coup de Chance is variously funny and sad, energetic and easygoing; a stumbling but satisfying autumnal drama that wanders amid the fading light and the golden leaves. For good measure, Allen even throws in an ending which stirs the memory of the classic moose-hunting routine from his old 1960s standup days; a rueful, airy aside that serves to bring the man’s career full-circle."
"Priscilla review – Sofia Coppola paints an absorbing, intimate portrait of Elvis’s wife","Based on Priscilla Presley’s memoir, the film shows how a naive schoolgirl became trapped behind the gates of Graceland in a bizarrely co-dependent relationship",4,"Child bride, infant sacrifice, bobbysoxer concubine: Priscilla Presley, wife of Elvis, is all these in Sofia Coppola’s eerily gripping, queasily claustrophobic portrait of marital loneliness, trapped behind the kitschy prison gates of Graceland while the King is away on tour, or shooting movies with glamorous worldly female co-stars and a creepily subservient male entourage. Priscilla becomes Memphis’s very own Lady Diana, with Ann-Margret or Nancy Sinatra in the Camilla Parker-Bowles role.The film is based on Elvis and Me, Priscilla’s 1985 memoir of the marriage, and demonstrates Coppola’s characteristically sisterly and non-judgmental intimacy with her heroine. The details, the atmosphere of Priscilla’s bizarre married life, its stretches of boredom and silence; all seem very real. As an insider account, this is a welcome corrective to Baz Luhrmann’s outsider fantasy Elvis and it redoubles what I think of as Coppola’s reputation as the Betty Friedan of 21st-century cinema, presenting us with her distinctive take on feminine mystique.Cailee Spaeny plays Priscilla, the 15-year-old schoolgirl living on a 1950s West German military base with her mom and army dad; she gets invited to a party hosted by Elvis Presley doing his military service. Elvis is rather unassumingly played by Jacob Elordi, who is shrewdly directed by Coppola in such a way that there are no Elvis-impersonation pyrotechnics to upstage Spaeny’s Priscilla. Presley is a perfect gentleman and does not press his attentions improperly on Priscilla. Instead, staggeringly, he persuades her parents to let her live at Graceland, with his own cantankerous father, Vernon, legally in loco parentis, so she can attend Catholic high school there. But when will they get married? And when will Elvis want to have sex with her?There is dark comedy in the extraordinary fan-wish-fulfilment life that Priscilla is living – at first. She gets to make out with Elvis in the evening and then pout over her schoolbooks in class the next morning; while all her schoolmates are dreaming of kissing Elvis, she is living the dream. But then the awful truth emerges. Elvis refrains from sex with Priscilla (while very clearly not refraining elsewhere), fetishising her intact quasi-childlike innocence while subjecting her to a festival of misogyny, coercion and control in parallel to the way he is kept in line by his overbearing manager, Colonel Tom Parker (who, perhaps oddly, doesn’t appear in the film).Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotionThe pure strangeness of Graceland is pungently conveyed: its weirdly modest smallness, the white grand piano, the creamy-oatmeal carpet. Theirs was a co-dependent life, very much centred on drugs, uppers and downers, to which Elvis introduced Priscilla early on; this was followed by an experiment with LSD, part of Presley’s wary and shortlived interest in the counterculture. And Graceland was the incongruously provincial location for it all.Eventually, Priscilla gets a baby, Lisa Marie, and an adult makeover closely policed by Elvis (who turns out to have strident views on women’s fashion); Priscilla’s hair and makeup job, intentionally or not, makes her look like one of the GoodFellas wives. But the movie argues that, as Priscilla grew up, Elvis became more and more infantilised, paranoid and charmless, especially in his endless Vegas residencies.Coppola’s portrait is absorbing, especially in Priscilla’s child phase, and if it is less distinctive in its final section, as Priscilla becomes more briskly disillusioned and realistic about what to expect, then that is to be expected. Her credulous servitude and innocence is more dramatic and more poignant. This film says a great deal about Elvis and the dysfunctional business he was in and Priscilla’s modest integrity and courage. Priscilla screened at the Venice film festival; it is released on 27 October in the US; it is released in UK and Irish cinemas on 26 December."
Evil Does Not Exist review – Ryu Hamaguchi’s enigmatic eco-parable eschews easy explanation,Venice film festival: Compositional quirks and unhurried direction turn this tale of a Tokyo company buying up land near a pristine lake into a complex and mysterious drama,4,"Ryu Hamaguchi’s quietist, enigmatic eco-parable Evil Does Not Exist refuses easy explanations and perhaps it refuses difficult explanations as well. It’s a complex drama, a realist film teetering on the edge of the uncanny, whose very title points the way towards the idea that there are shades of grey in every judgment we make. It is arguably opaque and contrived, and will possibly exasperate as many as it intrigues, but I found it rippling around in my mind long after the final, extended shot with its two figures receding into the mist.At first glance, this seems a cut-and-dried case of a story about corporate capitalism despoiling the environment: Takumi (played by acting newcomer Hitoshi Omika, a former AD in Hamaguchi’s previous films) lives with his young daughter Hana in a beautifully unspoiled village – almost like a figure in a folk tale. This idyllic spot, with a deer trail, is a short drive outside Tokyo: Takumi apparently makes a living chopping wood and gathering clear water from a stream in billy cans for a local noodle restaurant for whom this is an essential ingredient, far superior to mere tap water. Inevitably, this paradise can’t last: Takumi is already slightly uneasy at the gunshot-sounds of people hunting nearby, and for all that he is a devoted father, he has a bad habit of forgetting to pick Hana up from school.Things come to a crisis when Takumi and his neighbours learn that a Tokyo company has bought up swathes of land nearby, intending to turn it into a “glamping” site for well-off city tourists. The town meeting that this company perfunctorily sets up, supposedly to listen to residents’ concerns, reveals that the proposed site’s septic tank will poison the water supply, that the company is pushing through this scheme to qualify for post-pandemic government grants, and that it is quite indifferent to locals’ worries in any case. The two blandly smiling functionaries who pretend to listen to the village’s complaints at the meeting are employees of a TV talent agency which has diversified into corporate PR.But Hamaguchi’s narrative direction of travel becomes unclear. These two PRs reveal themselves to be unhappy and guilty at what they are doing, especially at their employers’ crass and clumsy plan to offer Takumi a “caretaker” job on the glamping site. A long dialogue scene during their car journey reveals that they are vulnerable human beings as much deserving of the audience’s respect as the villagers: and one even appears to have an epiphany or nervous breakdown right then and there in the woodland.And even Takumi’s own attitude to the glampers isn’t clear. At the meeting itself, so far from angrily and straightforwardly denouncing the scheme, he points out that he and all the other residents are themselves incomers, after a fashion, part of a governmental plan that allowed farming in that region after the war, which itself damaged the environment, to a degree.Hamaguchi takes all this at an absolutely unhurried pace, like that of a twig floating downstream. There are long stretches in which his camera will gaze up at the sky while drifting through the forest, and the musical score will sometimes hard-cut to silence at the end of a sequence like this. Weirdly, Hamaguchi’s camera appears to be attached to Takumi’s rear bumper in one scene in which he picks Hana up from school, the shot infinitesimally shudders and then moves along with the car at it leaves.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotionWhy? What is the point of these compositional quirks? What is the point of the story itself? Most cinema signposts everything and – to quote the phrase apocryphically attributed to Billy Wilder – makes everything obvious, especially the subtleties. This isn’t what Hamaguchi is doing: his movie is closer to a prose poem, in which the larger building blocks of narrative might not fit together in the expected way but be as mysterious and extraneous as glancingly small details. I’m not sure that Evil Does Not Exist is the very best of his work, but it is presented with such calm assurance and artistry that it compels a kind of wistful, if uncomprehending, assent."
Good Boy review – girl meets boy comedy-horror has rabidly bizarre premise,A smiling millionaire with poster-boy good looks seems the perfect catch for a scatty student – until she discover his ‘pet’ is a man masquerading as a dog,3,"There is a streak of boundary-pushing and wantonness to this Norwegian comedy-horror that bodes well for the career of director Viljar Bøe, even if this, his third feature, is not executed with quite enough finesse to match the rabid premise. It hangs on the quintessential modern dating conundrum: what would you do if you bagged your dream partner, only to find out that they live with someone who dresses and acts like their dog?That’s the dilemma for scatty student Sigrid (Katrine Lovise Øpstad Fredriksen), who, despite turning up to their first date in her gym clothes, seems to have struck on an implausible match of opposites in well-tailored, impeccably mannered, calorie-counting multimillionaire orphan Christian (Gard Løkke). She lounges in his bachelor mansion, gets crispy bacon on demand at breakfast – but almost runs away howling when his “pet”, Frank (Nicolai Narvesen Lied), crawls in on all fours during dinner. The impression she has hooked up with a barking-mad Bruce Wayne is compounded by the eerie normality with which Christian treats this arrangement.In the interests of love, Sigrid decides to take the higher path, educating herself about “puppy play” on the internet. But there appears to be nothing sexual going on between Christian and Frank, who is his childhood friend and fellow loner. As Sigrid habituates herself to a menage à trois, Bøe milks this scenario for layers of delightful discomfort. His film isn’t a Nordic S&M comedy of manners like 2019’s Dogs Don’t Wear Pants, nor a liberal probing of delusion like 2007’s Lars and the Real Girl. It also thrives on a spikier paranoia: that all this theatre is really a form of gaslighting, just with doggie treats, and Sigrid is being manipulated or groomed in some way.Both leads are good, but the ultra-controlled Løkke – with his poster-boy looks and too-timely smiles – is pivotal to stringing out the farce. Good Boy darkens in its second half, it goes in a rather conventional horror direction and, sadly, it opts not to get truly weird and tail-chase its more original impulses (like, as Sigrid asks, whether Frank gets to have sex). Still, there is enough meat here – touching on digital dating etiquette and the underlying emotional viscera – for a Hollywood remake. Time for Matt Damon to wriggle into that furry outfit. Good Boy is available on digital platforms on 11 September."
The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar review – Wes Anderson’s short and sweet Roald Dahl tale,"Venice film festival: Anderson’s second Dahl adaptation is a droll 40 minutes of beautifully composed nested stories, with Benedict Cumberbatch as a gambler who learns how to beat the house",3,"The sun-splashed Venice film festival provided an unlikely backdrop for the premiere of Wes Anderson’s The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar, an enjoyable bedtime story of sorts, converted from the 1976 tale by Roald Dahl. The guests sheltered from the heat inside the main cinema while the director moseyed on stage with a diffident shrug. What followed was a cosy, wholesome, purely soothing affair. The only thing missing was a cup of warm cocoa.“I hope that you like it. And if you don’t that’s OK, because it’s very short,” Anderson explained by way of introduction, setting the scene for a droll 40-minute featurette that will duly be heading over to Netflix within the space of a month. The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar marks the director’s second adaptation of Dahl, after his animated take on Fantastic Mr Fox, and recounts the fortunes of a wealthy gambler (played by Benedict Cumberbatch) who masters the ability to read the reverse sides of playing cards. Armed with this superpower, Sugar sets out to fleece his favourite London casino … only to awake the next morning feeling more morally bankrupt than ever.Close your eyes and imagine a Wes Anderson movie. The odds are that it looks very much like this one: beautifully composed and tailored to within an inch of its life. For better or worse, the director has a house style. For better or worse, he now seems chained to it. In Anderson’s best work (Rushmore, say, or The Royal Tenenbaums), the painstaking design gives the impression of somehow being authored by his protagonists. It’s almost as if the carefully arranged frames are the characters’ immaculate conceptions: an attempt at self-actualisation, or a fireguard against their vulnerabilities. In his lesser work, though, the technique is too much. It sucks oxygen from the films and reduces the people to waxworks. One longs to break open a window and allow in some fresh air.The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar, to its credit, makes a bonus of its artifice. Leaning into his role as Dahl’s translator, seemingly showing his workings every chance that he has, Anderson proceeds to spin a story within a story, deftly augmenting the conceit with sliding stage-sets and frequent nods to the audience.The tale starts out being narrated by Dahl (ably impersonated by Ralph Fiennes) in his writing shed. From there the baton is passed to Dr ZZ Chatterjee (Dev Patel) in Calcutta, then to Imdad Khan (Ben Kingsley), the self-styled “Man Who Could Read Without His Eyes” – and finally back to feckless Henry Sugar in his London townhouse. These people tell the story while simultaneously performing their roles, turning from the action to address the camera with such gusto that they surely risk whiplash – but the effect is amusing and invites us in on the joke. At one point Anderson even relaxes enough to poke fun at his own control-freak reputation. He has a stagehand materialise mid-scene in order to move Kingsley from one side of the shot to the other.“This will change my life!” exclaims vain, pointless Sugar upon gaining his all-seeing magic power – and so it does, except not quite in the way that he initially thought it might. The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar was widely regarded as one of Dahl’s gentler, happier short stories – insofar as it didn’t feature a serial killer landlady or an infant Adolf Hitler. It spun a reassuring yarn of redemption and saluted a bad man who made good. Anderson’s short, sweet, neatly managed production follows the original tale pretty much to the letter. The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar screened at the Venice film festival and is released on 27 September on Netflix."
Poor Things review – Emma Stone has a sexual adventure in Yorgos Lanthimos’s virtuoso comic epic,"Stone gives a hilarious, beyond-next-level performance as Bella Baxter, the experimental subject of a troubled Victorian anatomist, in Lanthimos’s toweringly bizarre comedy",5,"That cooing note of kindness and pity in the title is misleading – in fact, there is pure vivisectional ruthlessness in this toweringly bizarre epic. Poor Things is a steampunk-retrofuturist Victorian freakout and macabre black-comic horror, adapted by screenwriter Tony McNamara from the 1992 novel by Alasdair Gray and directed by the absurdist virtuoso Yorgos Lanthimos. Lanthimos shows us an extraordinary, artificial, contorted world, partly shot in monochrome, sometimes bulging out at us through a fish-eye lens, elsewhere lit from within in richly saturated tones, like an engraved colour plate.And his leading lady is someone who takes it to the next career level, or the level beyond the next level: Emma Stone. She gives an amazing and hilarious performance as the sexual-innocent primitive Bella Baxter, the secret experimental subject and ward of charismatic, troubled anatomist Dr Godwin Baxter (whom she calls “God”), played by Willem Dafoe. Bella’s beady gaze under a near-monobrow takes everything in, while she makes what sense she can from the brave new world with which Dr Baxter has surrounded her.Bella is a young woman who had attempted to take her own life by throwing herself from London’s Tower Bridge. Baxter daringly has her body retrieved under cover of darkness from the Thames’s muddy bank and – like a cross between Mary Shelley’s Victor Frankenstein and Shaw’s Henry Higgins – reanimates her using methods whose exotic ghastliness is only revealed at the story’s end.Childlike and yet adult-bodied and increasingly excited by her discovery of masturbation – which in turn stimulates her language skills beyond infantile pidgin English – Bella is a shocking and beguiling figure. She is tutored and looked after by Dr Baxter, his housekeeper Mrs Prim (a great turn from Vicky Pepperdine) and Baxter’s fresh-faced research assistant Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), who falls deeply in love with Bella. Baxter permits Max to propose to his young pupil on condition that the married couple continue to live with him in his colossally intricate townhouse.But disaster beckons when the solicitor who arrives with the documents formalising this arrangement turns out to be a bounder and a cad; he seduces Bella and takes her away with him on a grand European tour of sensual indulgence and adventure, and Dr Baxter fatalistically concludes he has no choice but to let Bella go. This wicked fellow is one Duncan Wedderburn – an outrageously funny performance from Mark Ruffalo, whose entire face is transformed into fleshy naughtiness by adding a moustache and, in one scene, a straw boater.Lanthimos draws on Lynch’s The Elephant Man and Franju’s Eyes Without a Face, and Emma Stone’s gloriously artless heroine has something of Herzog’s Kaspar Hauser or Emily Watson’s Bess in Lars von Trier’s Breaking the Waves. Her faintly jerky head movements and unselfconscious gait – awkward and yet somehow elegant at the same time – is also rather like Ray Bolger’s Scarecrow from The Wizard of Oz.With the disreputable Wedderburn, Bella visits Lisbon, where she is mesmerised by a beautiful fado song, and Alexandria, where she takes it upon herself to rescue people from poverty using Duncan’s winnings from the casino. In Paris they are to find their nadir and Bella realises that sex work is the key to paying the bills. Bella becomes, in her way, a great Victorian explorer and adventurer and discoverer of the sexual self, like a figure from Steven Marcus’s The Other Victorians or Ronald Pearsall’s The Worm in the Bud. And how amazing that she is entirely convincing by the end as a romantic figure and autodidact who, unlike Frankenstein’s monster, aspires to study medicine herself.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotionThis film comes to us from an elite group of talent, including cinematographer Robbie Ryan and production designers James Price and Shona Heath, with an insinuatingly strange musical score by Jerskin Fendrix.

Hollywoodgate review – a fascinating insight into the Taliban’s insular world,Venice film festival: It’s no surprise that Ibrahim Nash’at’s documentary lacks in-depth interviews – his subjects barely tolerate his presence as he reveals the fighters’ lack of purpose after the US withdrawal from Afghanistan,4,"The spoils of war are a chore in this fascinating fly-on-the-wall study of the Taliban’s first year in power. Ibrahim Nash’at’s documentary is named for its principal location, a former CIA stronghold on the outskirts of Kabul, hastily abandoned and haphazardly vandalised by its previous tenants. The base contains treasures but it has been left in a state. Afghan fighters pick their way through the corridors, weighing up their surroundings, wondering just where to begin. They could be a band of hotel cleaners called in to mop up after a heavy-duty stag weekend.Leading the band is Mawlawi Mansour, a bushy-bearded Taliban commander whose father was killed in a US airstrike. Nash’at shows him doggedly going about his duties. He stretches his legs on the newfangled treadmill in the gym. He checks the expiration date of cough drops and calamine lotion in the medical stockroom. “Our head doctor is lazy,” one of his lieutenants explains, at which point Mansour flashes a pained look at the camera.The commander likes to boast that his own wife was a doctor before giving up work as a condition of marriage. If Mrs Mansour was still free to practise, she might have been able to lick this small hospital into shape.Nash’at – who was born in Egypt and is based in Berlin – spent 12 months trailing Mansour and his crew, loitering in the background and shooting from the sidelines. If his finished film is light on probing interviews and rigorous analysis, there’s an obvious reason: his subjects all hate him.The Taliban fighters view every journalist as a foreign spy and have accepted the presence of this one only under duress. “That little devil is filming again,” one mutters when Nash’at draws too close. If the director misbehaves, says another, he will promptly be taken outside and killed.When US forces quit Afghanistan in the spring of 2021 they left behind an estimated $7bn (£5.5bn) worth of military equipment. Mansour’s main task – in addition to checking expiration dates – is to oversee the repair and repainting of the fighter jets and Black Hawk helicopters, officially in advance of a victory parade but also conceivably in preparation for a war against neighbouring Tajikistan.This prospect appears to provide the soldiers with a sense of purpose, something to fill their days and plug the gaps in their hearts. The Taliban are triumphant, but this win feels like a loss. “My burning wish is to see American troops still here,” one soldier admits. “That way I could ambush them, kill them, die and become a martyr.”While it would have been good to have Nash’at properly cross-examine these men, his film’s careful approach pays handsome dividends. Hollywoodate teases back a corner of the curtain to reveal a Taliban regime stitched awkwardly over the bones of US occupation. It shows us the soldiers pining for the caves where they once hid, and mourning the glorious death that has somehow been snatched from their grasp.The film hits its head-spinning crescendo during the surreal celebrations at Bagram airbase, which feature a motorbike parade by “the suicide bombing battalion”, a unit that wouldn’t have been out of place in Chris Morris’s Four Lions. The battalion’s members pass through in some haste, trailing their broken dreams and dashed ambitions. For these men in particular, there has been no happy ending. They ride off into an uncertain future; unfulfilled, still alive.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotion Hollywoodgate screened at the Venice film festival"
"Dogman review – the most ludicrous film you’ll see all year, maybe ever",Venice film festival: Luc Besson’s wacky revenge fantasy follows luckless drag artist Doug and his pack of canine chums that do his criminal bidding – you can’t look away,2,"Most children indulge in the occasional revenge fantasy. Imagine if a famous movie star decided to be your best friend – right after your actual best friend stopped talking to you. Or how about if MI5 got in touch with you because they needed a kid to help out with a top secret mission? Or what if you trained an enormous pack of assorted sizes of dogs to be your best friends, and they did your bidding and took down all your enemies and stole diamonds for you? This latter scenario is essentially the premise of the new film from Luc Besson, and it’s as wacky as it sounds.Caleb Landry Jones plays Doug, our luckless protagonist, whose life is such an unimaginably relentless shitshow that he retreats entirely from humanity and holes up in an abandoned school with a pack of dozens of canine chums. The doggos’ rapport with Doug is so strong that it borders on psychic. They understand English perfectly. They are as happy tiptoeing into a wealthy older woman’s bedroom to silently lift an expensive necklace from her nightstand as they are gripping a local crime lord’s nutsack in their vice-like jaws.But Doug isn’t just the ringleader of a group of miracle pups. A wheelchair user since midway through his wildly violent and dysfunctional childhood, he pivots to performing as a drag artist after an unsuccessful job-hunting montage set to Eurythmics’ Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This). Thereafter he divides his time between crooning Édith Piaf and Marlene Dietrich numbers and supervising his gang of canine criminals as they commit various jewel heists. He’s a multitasker.Now, if you close your mind to the possibilities of film and write off imaginative gambits as “ludicrous” without ever having really given a bold vision a chance, it’s not great; cinema should be an art where the ostensibly ludicrous can take flight and flourish. All that said, and all due respect to the originality and commitment displayed here, but this is as ludicrous a film as you’ll see all year, maybe ever. I’m sure there’s a way to make this theoretically fun premise work better, but regrettably Besson hasn’t found it.Besson reached the height of his popularity in the 1990s with films such as Léon and The Fifth Element, but has since faced rape allegations by an actor who worked with him on Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets, before being cleared of all charges. Dogman is the intended comeback, and it’ll certainly make you sit up and take notice. Unfortunately, once it has your attention, you simply can’t look away – and not in a good way.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotion Dogman screened at the Venice film festival."
The Knocking review – slow-burn cabin-in-the-woods horror sends an eco message,Three siblings return to the home in the forest where their father was murdered with an axe and their mother disappeared,3,"A Scandi entry in the cabin-in-the-woods horror subgenre, Joonas Pajunen and Max Seeck’s feature debut starts out in rather familiar territory. Years after a gruesome tragedy where their father is bludgeoned with an axe and their mother disappears, three siblings return to the site of the crime: their childhood home nestled in the depths of a mysterious forest.For much of its slow-burn running time, The Knocking ploughs the furrow of the reductive trauma plot that has weighed down many contemporary horror films. The tense reunion stirs up past secrets and resentments, and the characters are defined less by memorable traits than merely by revelations of the abuse they endured as children. The visuals are pretty much forgettable also, with overuse of that one stylistic device familiar from a litany of scary movies: an aerial drone shot of a car speeding down a lonely road, flanked by foreboding trees.Though shackled to a lacklustre beginning and middle, the third act proves to be an impressive surprise. In the same way that their dark family history has slowly poisoned the souls of the siblings, a malevolent force is also leaking out of every branch of the eerie forest. This culminates in a nearly wordless and surreal chase sequence bathed in crimson light. Without giving too much away, the earlier mentions of past trauma finally coalesce into a more concrete form of monstrous dread, transforming what could have been a run-of-the-mill flick into a thrilling eco-horror parable. The orchestral, classical-inflected score is another nice touch that further elevates the fatalistic final scenes. The Knocking is ultimately a drive worth taking.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotion The Knocking is released on 4 September on digital platforms."
Mercy Falls review – Highland horror aims to be a Scottish version of Predator,"From characters’ irrepressible horniness to a deeply confusing instigating incident, Ryan Hendrick’s hiking slasher has all the hallmarks of a dud",2,"‘Oh and Rhona … remember, the secret is to never look back,” says sinister hitchhiker Carla (Nicolette McKeown), as she climbs a cliff. “You mean down,” someone corrects her. Yes, we get the point, given that half the characters in the film are nursing past traumas, from random acts of rural brutality to Middle Eastern combat theatre flashbacks. But such is the unsubtle way of Ryan Hendrick’s overblown Highland horror; it can’t settle for simply being a stripped-down descent into wilderness atavism. It also chucks in an irrepressibly horny crew of hikers, creepy Scottish folktales and gratuitous Homeric quotations for good measure.The real killer is the highly implausible instigating incident. Rhona (Lauren Lyle) and pals set off on to the moors to locate the family cabin she has been bequeathed, despite grim memories of the area. But then tensions, especially simmering sexual jealousy, rise when they lose their bearings and combat veteran Carla takes matters into her own hands. It’s not really clear why she takes such drastic action, other than the need – with her insistence that they are now bound together by this terrible event – to get these sorry daytrippers marching even further towards backwoods peril.Mercy Falls makes basic errors of dramatic orientation: mistaking characters’ bedhopping designs for personality traits, letting them act irrationally in service of the plot (solo toilet trips, or example, would seem like a no-no). But Hendrick does undeniably have a feel for the terrain, filming the glens, crags and heaths lovingly in interludes between the bloodletting, occasionally using the illusion of a diorama, making lifesize things look miniature, to queasy effect.It inevitably boils down to what you might call a Scottish version of Predator, only with a woman in Gore-Tex instead of Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Carla’s unhinged, keffiyeh-wearing fugitive instead of old crabface. But at least Carla has the good grace to knock off the ensemble in ascending order of acting ability, leaving this contrived trek resting in the steady hands of Lyle, who always underplays with an intriguing resoluteness. Mercy Falls is released on 1 September in UK cinemas and on 6 November on digital platforms."
Rumba Rules review – a window on to the passion of the Congolese music scene,"Intimate footage captures the frenetic energy, onstage passion and power struggles at the heart of the Brigade Sarbati Orchestra in Kinshasa",3,"An up-close-and-personal portrait of the long-running Brigade Sarbati Orchestra, a titan in the Congolese music scene, this vibrates with the energy that emanates from studio rehearsals and live performances. Juxtaposed with fly-on-the-wall observations of lengthy recording sessions is vibrant footage of the bustling Kinshasa streets, a dynamic flow of imagery that underlines how rumba forms an integral part of the country’s cultural heritage.Congolese rumba might seem purely improvisational on the surface, but in practice it requires immense discipline and professional rapport. When following extended studio sessions, the camera swirls between singers and instrumentalists, the frenetic movements capturing the thrilling magic that sparks when the musicians play off each other. On stage, the cathartic pleasure of these pieces is intensified by the amazing dancers, whose swaying hips and dexterous footwork sends the crowd into ecstatic frenzy.But amid the beautiful music produced by the Brigade Sarbati Orchestra, there are also notes of discord. A young musician called Lumumba speaks candidly about what he considers favouritism inside the Brigade Sarbati, with similar tensions emerging inside the recording studio. In one scene, the musicians argue fiercely over whose names should be included in a song’s lyrics.Rumba Rules grapples with these internal disputes, but neglects to dive deeper into another glaring imbalance: the obvious gender disparity in the orchestra, where there are female dancers yet the musicians on screen are predominantly male. Ending on the melancholic image of Lumumba gently caressing a statue of legendary Congolese musician Franco Luambo, the film evokes the passion as well as the turmoil of a new generation of rumba artists. The last paragraph of this article was amended on 31 August 2023 to clarify that while there are female dancers in the film, the musicians are predominantly male. Rumba Rules is available from 1 September on True Story."
Mob Land review – southern gothic drama​ drags like a wounded pig,"Stephen Dorff’s mob enforcer clashes with a sheriff and his dirt-track racer nephew in this clunky​, badly acted ​tale",2,"With its deep-fried cinematography, engine oil-colour palette and a score that seems to be composed almost entirely of reverb-heavy blues guitar and cicadas, Mob Land is going all in on the deep southern gothic atmosphere. It’s just a pity that the acting is so conspicuously effortful, the plot is formulaic and the pacing drags like a wounded pig at a hog shoot.Shiloh Fernandez stars as Shelby, a financially struggling dirt track racer; John Travolta is Shelby’s uncle, the jaded sheriff who brings his own brand of justice to the table. Stephen Dorff chews his way through the role of an out-of-town mob enforcer who crosses paths with both."
Chuck Chuck Baby review – whimsy and realism combine in big-hearted romance,"Louise Brealey is put-upon Helen, a chicken factory worker who gets a second chance at love, in Janis Pugh’s generous and gritty film",3,"Here’s a rousing empowerment-anthem of a movie that’s not afraid to paint its romance plotline in big, bold brushstrokes; occasionally it overdoes things but the rush of emotion carries everything along in its path, helped by the deployment of radio-friendly standards by Neil Diamond and the like that turns the film into an impromptu musical and allows writer-director Janis Pugh to stage (relatively) elaborate dance sequences and big emotional scenes.The central figure is put-upon chicken-processing factory worker Helen (played by Louise Brealey) who has a complicated domestic situation: she lives in the same crummy terrace as her oafish husband Gary, from whom she is separated but seemingly not actually divorced, and shares the place with his new, much younger, girlfriend Amy (Emily Fairn) and their newly arrived baby. Also on the premises is Gary’s terminally ill mother Gwen (Sorcha Cusack), for whom Helen acts a carer but is the quasi-maternal figure that Helen appears to long for. There’s also a rowdy Greek chorus of Helen’s fellow factory workers who are perhaps designed as a counterpoint to Helen’s introverted, clenched unhappiness, at least at first.The dam breaks with the arrival next door of glamorous returnee Joanne (Annabel Scholey) who, it turns out, had fascinated Helen right back from their schooldays together, 20 years earlier – though, we are given to understand, they barely spoke. But it doesn’t take long before Joanne is turning up at the factory with her sports car and ghetto blaster and whisking Helen off for a bit of romancing, in which a detached store-mannequin doll’s head and a pair of stilts play a significant part. Joanne isn’t quite the problem-free zone she initially appears: she has her own backstory of upset and humiliation to cope with, too.Pugh’s film mixes standard-issue Brit-misery realism with elements of whimsy: the opening scene, for example, features a floating dandelion seed-head that is amusingly reminiscent of the drifting tumbleweed in the Coen brother’s Big Lebowski, and one of the musical numbers descends into a massive chicken-carcass fight inside the factory. (You have to hope the poultry weren’t real.) In contrast, Pugh stages a genuinely alarming scene in which Gary – hitherto a bit of a pantomime villain – loses it at a funeral with briefly terrifying results. Both leads are very good, with Brealey in particular handling the switch of registers – from heart-to-hearts with Gwen, bitter disagreements with Gary, and supercharged, over-the-top singalongs – with aplomb. In the end, Pugh’s film undoubtedly wants to warm hearts, and this it manages to full effect.Chuck Chuck Baby screened at the Edinburgh film festivalAll of our Edinburgh festival reviews"
Edinburgh art festival 2023 review – from a riveting meditation on borders to magnificent monochromes,Various venuesA thought-provoking film by Turner prize winner Lawrence Abu Hamdan and the unforgettable photographs of Markéta Luskačová are among the highlights of an uneven lineup,0,"Film scene: a wood-panelled library of some elegance on the Canadian-American border. So precisely on the border, in fact, that a line of black duct tape running across the polished marble floor divides the building between Quebec and Vermont.It was here, explains our soft-spoken narrator, that three men brought a backpack through the US entrance in 2011, depositing it in a lavatory to be collected by a criminal who then left through the Canadian exit. The bag was full of smuggled guns.In 45th Parallel, a film by the Turner prize-winning artist Lawrence Abu Hamdan screening at Edinburgh’s Talbot Rice Gallery, the camera now homes in on the narrator, Mahdi Fleifel. A Danish-Palestinian director, Fleifel knows something about borders himself, having been raised in a refugee camp in Lebanon. In the film, he is sitting in the adjoining opera house of the Haskell Free Library. On stage (technically Quebec; the opera house’s seating is in Vermont) is footage of the fatal spot on the Mexican-American border that featured in the notorious supreme court case of Hernández v Mesa.Jesus Mesa was a US border patrol agent who came across some Mexican children playing on the border one June evening in 2010. He killed unarmed Mexican teenager Sergio Hernández with a single gunshot to the head. All that separated them was 18 metres (60ft) and the invisible border – literally an unmarked line in the sand.Mexico indicted Mesa for murder, but the US refused to extradite him. The US supreme court voted 5-4 that the American constitution terminates at the border and does not extend – as Mesa’s bullet did –into Mexico. The implications of this verdict (to paraphrase the film’s superb script) are very far-reaching – like the fatal bullet itself.Drone strikes launched in the US end the lives of Syrian civilians, infants in Afghanistan, a wedding procession in Yemen. Devastating reconnaissance footage is woven into the film’s immensely subtle narrative. Borders prove intangible and absurd, porous in life, and susceptible to the loopholes embodied in the Haskell Library itself, yet also a matter of life and death, according to the law.Abu Hamdan’s work is always a brilliant fusion of moving image, researched fact and theatrical performance (in this case by the captivating Fleifel). Completed last year, 45th Parallel is his best film yet and not to be missed at this somewhat uneven edition of the annual Edinburgh art festival. All its moral and philosophical dilemmas, its visions, tales and sounds (including an eerie music specially scored for the opera house scenes) are as condensed as a sonnet. The whole vast experience is contained in 15 minutes.Also at the Talbot Rice Gallery, Irish artist Jesse Jones has turned the next-door gallery, ordinarily full of light, into a pitch-black multimedia installation, The Tower. Out of the darkness looms a sequence of spotlit vignettes: a circular stone portal in the wall, pierced with holes through which you peer into an anchorite’s cell; a girl crouched at the bottom of a towering ladder; a stone statue of a long-haired woman dressed in nothing but animal skins, rising out of a heap of shattered rocks.On a giant screen, young women sing in ecstatic medieval polyphony. There is a prevailing sense of female community, of the bonds between women, the heights they have to scale, the darkness into which they are pushed, punished, shut away. Bewildering when you first enter, the elements gradually begin to merge into a kind of ancient-modern promenade performance that clearly touches on Hildegard of Bingen and Julian of Norwich. But only the accompanying text, with its references to Ireland’s patriarchal history, and its abortion laws, brings the work into the present or indeed into any kind of meaningful coherence.More concise, and far less elaborate, is a work by Crystal Bennes in Platform: Early Career Artist award at Trinity Apse, a former gothic kirk off the Royal Mile. Bennes’s subject is the 17th-century economist and politician William Petty and his early version of racial eugenics, a proposal to “improve” Ireland by sending 7,000 English women into forced marriage with Irish men. Their children would all be raised as English Protestants, the girls with a work ethic invoked here in sculptures related to the hard labour of laundry, land and dairy farms. Best of all is a lifesize cameo of the vile Petty, bewigged, impressed into the surface of a basin of what appears to be curdled and solidifying milk.A few steps further down the steep stone alleys off the Mile is the strangest contrast imaginable, between two well-established artists in prominent public galleries.Peter Howson has been awarded a three-floor retrospective at the City Art Centre at the age of 65. Nobody even slightly familiar with the strenuous and tormented expressionism of this Ayrshire-raised, Glasgow-trained painter will be surprised to hear that very little has changed down the years. Where Howson once painted the hell of Glasgow life among drunks, vagrants, the poor and unemployed, so he came to record the hell of the Bosnian war with the same brutal machismo, conflating hints of Michelangelo with a raw and sometimes caricatural muscularity.And so he now paints scenes from the Bible, having a new sense of God’s presence in the world. There are small portrait heads of gnarled saints and apostles and vast martyrdoms and crucifixions. Wall texts declare these works to be “countercultural to the expectations of a 21st-century artist” but they are entirely expected in other ways. Everything, from the delicate to the numinous, compassionate or redemptive, is sacrificed to the force of Howson’s dark brushwork. We are all still in hell.Directly across the road at the Fruitmarket gallery, Portuguese artist Leonor Antunes has a hanging garden – or perhaps it is more like a sequence of rooms – of knotted and woven works suspended from the ceiling. Each is diaphanous and elegant, crafted in all kinds of materials from silk, twine and hemp to copper wire and pineapple leather. Some feel like screened enclosures, others are more vine-like, reminiscent of bridles or rope ladders.The works apparently refer to other artists, including Lena Bergner and Trude Guermonprez, Bauhaus designers forced to flee Germany in the 1940s, and Sadie Speight who worked on the Royal Festival Hall. Their names occasionally appear in Antunes’s titles, as if she were talking to them somewhere offstage. And though there is an almost ethereal serenity to this refined and meticulous art, it is also discreet to the point of reticence, if not withdrawal.The Stills gallery has a magnificent show of monochrome photographs by the veteran Prague-born photographer Markéta Luskačová, focused upon her images of children’s lives. Gawping, gazing, curious, rapt, comforting each other in fights, innocently aping the adults, trying to learn how to be grown up, in hardship or poverty, when still young enough to invent hilarious games involving nothing but their own school jumpers.At first, it seems they are all from Soviet bloc countries – four to a bed, out on their mother’s back during the potato harvest, watching itinerant jugglers in some far-distant market. But then you notice the familiar stripes of a primary school dress in some English playground in summer and the dreich flat sands of Whitley Bay in Tyne and Wear. The street musician performing with a couple of small puppets, poignant counterparts of the human infants in the buggy beside her, was photographed in London in 1990.Luskačová’s compositions are as superb as her power of noticing. Girls skip across a playground, linked cardigan to cardigan in a chain of black diamonds. A boy holds his upright dog by the paw, a little friend exactly half his height. A child stands vertical before his grandmother, flat upon the floor, in a configuration like a sign of the cross. It takes a moment before you realise she is dead.Luskačová wheeled her own small son around the London to which she fled, from communist Prague, in 1975. It is almost as if she takes in the world from his height. A photograph shot in Brick Lane in 1977 shows an encounter between a lion cub and a greyhound, barely restrained on its leash. Behind them stand a pair of small children, equally alive to the staggering moment.Lawrence Abu Hamdan: 45th Parallel is at the Talbot Rice Gallery, Edinburgh, until 30 SeptemberThe Tower is at the Talbot Rice Gallery, Edinburgh, until 30 SeptemberPlatform: Early Career Artist award is at Trinity Apse, Edinburgh, until 27 AugustWhen the Apple Ripens: Peter Howson at 65 is at the City Art Centre, Edinburgh, until 1 OctoberLeonor Antunes: The Apparent Length of a Floor Area is at the Fruitmarket, Edinburgh, until 8 OctoberMarkéta Luskačová is at Stills, Edinburgh, until 7 October.

TIM review – clunky AI paranoia thriller,Eamon Farren makes a creepy robot but is let down by the obvious cyborg stalker plot in this techno-chiller,2,"This stylishly icy-looking thriller sounds the techno-fear klaxon and stirs up a hornet’s nest of paranoia about AI and deep fake technology, but then rather misses the point with a clunky cyborg stalker plot. Prosthetics engineer Abi (Georgina Campbell) takes a new job with fringe benefits – specifically a passive-aggressive robot butler named TIM (Eamon Farren, suitably creepy). TIM is attentive and solicitous, but the numerous cutaways to knives and waste disposal units leave us with little doubt about the threats that lurk in Abi’s perfect life."
Lie With Me review – handsome but predictable French drama,"Based on a bestselling novel, this tale of a middle-aged author who returns to his home town to reconnect with his romantic past is oddly insular and fussy",3,"A celebrated middle-aged author returns, for the first time in 35 years, to his home town in the Cognac-producing region in south-western France. Stéphane (Guillaume de Tonquédec) has been asked to give a keynote speech, but his motives for accepting the invitation have more to do with reconnecting with his own romantic past. He bonds with Lucas (Victor Belmondo), a young man who, it turns out, is the son of Stéphane’s long-lost first love.Adapted from an autobiographical novel by Philippe Besson and weaving together two timelines, this is a handsome but ploddingly predictable drama. The striking wide-screen cinematography gives an impression of generous scope and openness. But in fact, like Stéphane himself, the storytelling is oddly insular and fussy. The highlight here is a supporting character: the longsuffering event organiser Gaëlle, played by Guilaine Londez with a huge, over-stretched smile and the kind of clenched-jawed positivity that seems to teeter on the brink of psychosis."
"Love Affair, or The Case of the Missing Switchboard Operator review – dissident sex and death","A Yugoslavian pulp classic from 1967, this tale of a young woman’s erotic misadventures more than matches the French new wave for black humour",5,"Dušan Makavejev was the Serbian creator of the incendiary 1971 movie WR: Mysteries of the Organism, the final word in that title destined forever to be misread as “orgasm”. He was a satirist, political subversive and eroto-evangelist, a performance artist of ex-Yugoslavia’s cinematic Black Wave. Love Affair, or The Case of the Missing Switchboard Operator is an early work from 1967, a brilliant pulp classic which showed that the 1960s could swing behind the iron curtain. I wonder: did anything in the French new wave measure up to this level of nihilist black humour? Godard gave us Breathless; Makavejev gave us an actual breathless corpse.It’s about a bored young woman working for a telephone exchange: she wears an audio headset, pushing plugs into sockets and putting people through. She falls in love with an intense young man employed in plumbing and waterworks, but cheats on him with the sleazy postman to the murderous rage of her new boyfriend – and vanishes. The result is something insouciantly explicit and disturbing that defies classification. The action is bisected with digressive lectures on sexology and criminology, with slogans flashed up on screen, clips from Soviet propaganda movies, fourth walls broken. You might call it a forensic crime comedy because the love affair is interspersed with autopsy scenes of the young woman’s corpse: a truly chilling juxtaposition.Izabela (Eva Ras) works on the switchboard alongside her friend Ruza (Ruzica Sokic), a job fraught with the symbolism of connection and communication. They are always having to fend off the approaches of Mica (Miodrag Andric), a guy who delivers telegrams on his motorbike. Walking on the streets one day, Izabela and Ruza run into Ahmed (Slobodan Aligrudic), a charmingly shy young man and a Muslim; he drolly refers to himself as a “Turk”. Later when he gets Izabela pregnant, he cheerfully says: “You’ll bear me a little Turkish janissary!” They begin a fervent affair, and more or less move in together in Izabela’s little flat, but when she is left alone for a month while Ahmed is away, her yearning physical dissatisfactions are exploited by Mica.The film is about politics, sex and death. Or mostly sex and death. Or mostly sex. Sex is the great rebellion in this film, and the great warning. Izabela is killed by a male figure who for all his own unorthodoxy and boozy indiscipline is a submissive follower of the party line. Sex can be an apolitical form of conflict; it does not explicitly exist in opposition to the government, but the erotic mode is revolutionary by its very nature. This film is a short, sharp shock of exhilaration and artistic dissent. Love Affair, or The Case of the Missing Switchboard Operator is available from 17 August on Klassiki."
Zo Reken review – Toyota Land Cruiser becomes a safe space in conflict-ridden Haiti,Debates on national identity and foreign aid are par for the course for car riders – though this documentary is itself tangled up in the country’s complex power structures,3,"‘Zo reken” means “shark bones” in Haitian Creole, and refers to a traditional cane liquor purported to increase virility. It is also a local nickname for the Toyota Land Cruiser, a high-powered car that can breezily weather the tough road conditions in Port-au-Prince. Largely shot in the back of one of these vehicles, Emanuel Licha’s documentary is structured around a steady flow of conversations on national identity, political conflicts and foreign intervention.Emerging from these discussions is discontent at the government of Jovenel Moïse – the country’s former president who was assassinated in 2021 – as well as a distrust of international humanitarian aid. One passenger, for example, laments on the irony of how support from NGOs has had the negative effect of increasing Haiti’s dependence on wealthier countries. Once the funding dries up and the medical volunteers depart, existing healthcare infrastructure is left worse for wear. And while the interior of the “zo reken” feels like a safe space for spirited debate, the camera also peeks through the windows to observe the tumultuous reality outside. Traffic stops are crowded with vagrants, and talk of young men being gunned down emerges from the winding streets.Used by NGOs as well as the Haitian police, the Toyota Land Cruiser is itself a thorny symbol of power – even oppression. Zo Reken succeeds in dissecting this paradox, though the fly-on-the-wall style evidences a lack of self-interrogation on the film-makers’ part. Like the aid workers, Licha and many of the crew are outsiders, and Zo Reken was also produced with international funding. In other words, the film’s very existence is entangled within the same problematic structures criticised by its Haitian interviewees. If this complex position had been touched upon, this portrait of Haiti might have stretched beyond what is immediately visible in front of the camera. Zo Reken is available from 18 August on True Story."
Puffin Rock and the New Friends review – gentle animated balm from the makers of Wolfwalkers,This eco-parable from Ireland’s Cartoon Saloon is a big-screen treat for parents and preschoolers alike,3,"The much-loved animation series from Ireland’s Cartoon Saloon (Wolfwalkers, Song of the Sea) gets a big-screen spinoff, which will be welcome news for preschool puffin fans and for parents who fancy losing themselves in a gentle, gorgeously animated balm of a film. Minor peril comes in the form of seagulls eyeing an unprotected little egg. But the real threat is climate change in this entry-level eco-parable: Puffin Rock welcomes a community of refugee puffins whose habitats have been ravaged by storms. And, after a few misunderstandings and some egg-based jeopardy, Oona the puffin and her little brother Baba find some new buddies."
"Red, White & Royal Blue review – enemies become lovers in super-slick queer romance",Taylor Zakhar Perez and Nicholas Galitzine unleash a dual charisma assault in this micro-managed adaptation of Casey McQuiston’s YA bestseller,3,"The very public ill will between Alex (Taylor Zakhar Perez), the son of the president of the US, and Britain’s Prince Henry (Nicholas Galitzine), second in line to the throne, threatens to cause an international incident. But the urgent public relations damage control exercise has unforeseen consequences: the two become firm friends, and then much more.This adaptation of a bestselling novel by Casey McQuiston is so slick and polished, it feels obsessively micro-managed rather than directed. It’s an approach that makes for a glossily accessible piece of YA fluff, at the expense of much in the way of personality. Fortunately, the twin charisma assault of the two leads adds considerably to the film’s appeal. It turns out that watching two impossibly beautiful boys making cow eyes at each other might be just the escapist pulp we need right now.On Amazon Prime Video"
Variety review – fierce feminist porn drama from the 80s New York underground,Bette Gordon’s fascinating 1983 film about a woman working in an adult movie theatre has a script by Kathy Acker and parts for Nan Goldin and Spalding Gray ,4,"The 1983 indie-underground New York movie Variety, directed by Bette Gordon and scripted by Kathy Acker, is re-released for its 40-year anniversary. It is a flawed but fascinating critique of the male gaze, the porn gaze, and the luxurious ordeal of guilty voyeurism. Gordon casts a female lead, flipping gender assumptions and turning the tables on the underworld quest-torments of Paul Schrader’s male heroes in the likes of Taxi Driver and Hardcore. Perhaps she was inspired by the mysterious inner life of the listless young woman played by Diahnne Abbott in Taxi Driver, working behind the porn-cinema concessions counter, irritated by Travis Bickle’s inquiries about what candy she has: “What you see is what we got.”Actor and film-maker Sandy McLeod plays Christine, a demure young middle-class woman from Michigan who is desperate for money after failing to get into media or publishing in Manhattan and falling behind on her rent. Prompted by her friend Nan (played by the artist and future photography star Nan Goldin), she takes a job tearing tickets in a scuzzy adult movie theatre near Times Square, ironically called Variety though it offers an unvarying bill of pornography. She finds herself strangely unsettled by the movies on offer, and by the attentions of Louie (Richard M Davidson), a wealthy older man she sees there – a rather classic porn-narrative situation, in fact. Luis Guzmán plays Jose, an amiable guy who works at the cinema; Spalding Gray is the voice of a creep who leaves pervy messages on Christine’s answering machine.Louie doesn’t appear to be a creep in the normal run of things. He takes Christine on a date to a baseball game at Yankee Stadium (of all the old-fashioned things), where he seems to have a private box, taking her there in his own chauffeured car, making flirty conversation but basically behaving like a gentleman. Christine is piqued and slightly hurt when he says he has to leave and that his driver will take her home. She then becomes obsessed with Louie and what she thinks are his mafia connections to porn, and starts following him everywhere.The extended tailing and surveillance scenes I think are the weakest part of the film; we drift into some slightly hackneyed and derivative Coppola/Conversation territory and … well, yes … Louie is probably a mobster or crook, but so what? Did we think anything else? The strongest scenes are the weirdest: Christine keeps confiding about this awful new job she has to her male friend Mark (Will Patton), with horribly vivid descriptions of how the auditorium reeks of Lysol disinfectant when it opens for business first thing in the morning. Then she disgusts and scares him by zoning out into a reverie mid-conversation, speaking aloud her weird porn fantasies as if in a trance. It is genuinely really strange, one of those extended dialogue scenes and two-shot scenes that indie movies did in those days, with semi-improv dialogue that could ramble on for ever and yet keep your attention.There are also of course the archival scenes of New York, with the ambient sound recording of the era giving us a ghostly honking in the distance. A single static shot of Times Square traffic with nothing happening had me on the edge of my seat. Part of what is so strange about the “porn theatre” genre is its comment on city design; in those days, in New York or indeed London, porn theatres (on sites now occupied by Starbucks outlets and Gap stores) just stood there, in or near the respectable commercial centre in all their unacknowledged squalor.Variety is a sharp, fierce, engaged piece of work.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotion Variety is released on 11 August in UK cinemas"
The Rooster review – Hugo Weaving kicks this study of masculinity into gear,"Actor turned film-maker Mark Leonard Winter’s directorial debut, which pairs veteran Weaving as a slobbering hermit with Phoenix Raei’s broken cop, doesn’t hurry towards anything",3,"I tend to wince whenever I hear a film introduced as a blend of comedy and tragedy – not because it’s a bad combination, but because it’s one of the hardest to get right. So many artists attempt to tickle our funny bones while hitting us where it hurts, and so many come up short. Actor turned film-maker Mark Leonard Winter gives it a noble crack in his directorial debut The Rooster, a bumpy outdoorsy drama about two broken men – a cop and a hermit – connecting and potentially healing through the deployment of pensive stares and introspective dialogue, performed in Australian bush settings.The film’s core dynamic works in contrasts, pairing Phoenix Raei’s sullen cop Dan with a violently loud recluse played by Hugo Weaving. The latter’s grubby look and sheer hermitness reminded me of Paul Dano in Swiss Army Man, the so-called “boner corpse movie” starring Daniel Radcliffe as the corpse and Dano as a filthy outcast who lugs it around. I’m not sure whether that rather idiosyncratic picture (from the directors of Everything Everywhere All at Once) ruined my appetite for off-the-grid films about men bonding, or whether it renewed my appreciation of ones that don’t follow its lead (no corpses, no boners).Winter’s production does include a dead body: one of Dan’s childhood friends. In an early scene, Dan tenderly cups the dead man’s face with his hands and gets in close, pressing his nose against the corpse’s. Circumstances around the death cause Dan great guilt and anguish, so he acts on a desire all of us have had at some point in our lives: he runs off into the woods and says arrivederci to civilised society.In the middle of nowhere, he bumps into Weaving’s slobbering fiend, who tells him to bugger off because “this is my forest”. But Dan has booze. The hermit likes booze. So the pair sit and talk. Their relationship is fractious and their friendship hard-earned. Several times the hermit pushes Dan away, but you know this isn’t going to stick because you can feel the film bringing them together. Everything is predicated on their union. When Dan asks the hermit what line of work he’s in – as if he’s speaking to some guy on LinkedIn – the hermit responds: “Contemplation.” This is a good example of how Winter (who also wrote the screenplay) segues into comedy: with moments that are slightly coy and knowing, but never enough to undercut the characters’ emotions.Contemplation also describes the tone of Winter’s direction. The Rooster is nothing if not ponderous and doesn’t hurry towards anything – including introducing Weaving. When his character arrives we’re grateful, because Weaving provides the kick the film needs. Winter, no doubt influenced by his work in front of the camera, is generous to his cast, affording them meaty monologues and airy sequences, although not always to the film’s benefit.Raei’s leading performance is admirably subtle in some respects, but his presence isn’t quite enough to carry the film through its many quiet moments. We spend lots of time alone with Dan, yet his story still feels only partially told. None of the scenes that focus on Dan alone slip, but they get long and windy, with too much oxygen in the frame.Weaving is the film’s sledgehammer, smashing the quietude to bits. He’s the chalk to Raei’s cheese. The veteran performer gets the colourful part and it’s his grimy, grizzled face that will come to mind after the credits roll. The Rooster is not top tier in the actor’s oeuvre, but watching him experiment and push the drama into more dynamic directions provides the film’s key appeal. As a “Hugo Weaving goes feral in the bush” movie, The Rooster delivers. As an exploration of masculinity and a drama about two men connecting, it’s decent but unexceptional.The Rooster is currently screening as part of Melbourne international film festival. A general release date is yet to be announced."
The Communion Girl review – teens spooked by holy terror in creepy-doll horror,The stifling religious and social conformity of a small Spanish town is the source of the shocks in this scare story – along with a spectral girl in white,3,"Here is another sociologically buttressed Spanish-language gothic horror to file alongside The Devil’s Backbone and The Orphanage. With this film set near 1980s Tarragona, director Víctor García (who has the ninth Hellraiser film, from 2011, on his résumé) draws on a convincing period setting to nourish his scare story – even if the shocks aren’t especially chilling, and the sense of claustrophobic entrapment in the milieu is undermined by a cop-out open ending.Teenager Sara (Carla Campra) is newly arrived in town, and struggling to adjust to this backwater with its stifling piety and social snobbery. After letting off some steam at a club with her hothead pal Rebe (Aina Quiñones) and hitching a lift back with a pair of local bad boys, they almost crash when a spectral girl in a communion dress runs in front of their car. Obviously Chucky hadn’t come out in Spain at this point, because they walk away with her creepy, pucker-faced communion doll. A mottled infection begins spreading up Sara’s arm, and she begins experiencing appalling visions in broad daylight.In truth, these flashbacks – of being drowned in a well by a hideous putrefying revenant – prod us with the horror stick somewhat unsubtly. Much more intriguing is the social context supplied by García and fellow writers Guillem Clua and Alberto Marini, as Sara learns she is not the first person in the town to be afflicted. This malaise seems to run historically through the teenage population – like the classic Charles Burns comic Black Hole – but its source, and the illness’s metaphorical meaning, is not obvious.It could be social conformity, and as Sara, Rebe and hunky greaser Pedro (Marc Soler) track down what happened to the original communion girl, all roads seem to be leading towards the Catholic church. But García, perhaps hoping to start a franchise, is strangely reluctant to fully nail the story shut. It feels like a compromise that squanders the carefully layered social dynamics and uniformly strong acting, full of hormonal Sturm und Drang. The Communion Girl is available on Shudder on 11 August"
Hunt Club review – Mena Suvari best thing about shonky human-hunt horror,Self-consciously tacky effort recalls the classic horror films that made a spectacle of women being murdered and abused,2,"This is frankly a shonky bit of exploitative nonsense that, in a way, recalls the classic horror films that feminist film theorist Carol J Clover wrote about so perceptively in her foundational tome Men, Women and Chainsaws. Such films – in this case, on an island where vile rich men espousing misogynist views hunt down and kill the women they’ve trafficked there – only to turn the tables in the last act when the “final girls” triumph so that female viewers might experience a cathartic thrill of vengeance.That said, one gets the impression that the film-makers on Hunt Club, starting with screenwriters David Lipper (who has a supporting role here) and John Saunders, and director Elizabeth Blake-Thomas, aren’t taking any of this that seriously. The film seems to revel in the low-budget tackiness of it all, caking the underwear-clad extras in fake blood, and casting icons of schlock cinema (Mickey Rourke, Casper Van Dien) in key villainous roles.Former Starship Trooper of yore, Van Dien plays the big boss here, a character called Carter who sports cowboy hats and western-style shirts with complicated details; he hopes to raise his son Jackson (Will Peltz) to be a real man like him who will despise cis women, trans people, and anyone gay or even remotely gay adjacent. In a roadside diner, they meet Cassandra (Mena Suvari, who seems to have barely aged a day since the late 1990s when she starred opposite Kevin Spacey in American Beauty), who has just had a fight with her girlfriend Tessa (Maya Stojan).Lured by Carter’s promise that she can take home $100k if she wins the hunt, Cassandra goes with the father and son to the island, along with a younger woman called Lexi (Jessica Belkin) who answered an online ad placed by Conrad (Lipper) and Teddy (Jason London) in order to earn tuition money as an escort. See, girls? No good can come from wanting to get an education. Suvari gives her character’s displays of despair, fury and determination a bit of welly, especially when the time comes to fight Rourke, whose face looks more like a tenderised side of beef every year. Hopefully, casting agents may see this and offer Suvari a chance to do something more upmarket in the future. Hunt Club is released on 14 August on digital platforms"
Just Super review – good-natured Scandi superhero toon with egalitarian vibes,Heroes aren’t necessarily what they’re cracked up to be in this gentle watch that has all the right messaging,3,"This sweet, good-natured kids animation from Norway has impeccable Scandi values. It’s a superhero cartoon with the egalitarian message that maybe superheroes aren’t all they’re cracked up to be: all me-me-me and obsessed with their own awesomeness. Wouldn’t it be better if everyone pulled together as a community?Just Super is set in a small town, home to an 11-year-old girl called Hedvig (voiced by Reilley Ott). The big secret in Hedvig’s family is that for generations the eldest child becomes the town’s superhero, Super Lion. Hedvig’s dad, a strapping specimen of Viking manliness (Jean Luc Julien), is the current incarnation. All the Super Lions wear the same costume that has been handed down since the year dot, a ribbed wool onesie in beige that magnifies the wearer’s natural skills into superpowers.The trouble for little Hedvig is that she doesn’t appear to have any skills to magnify. She’s not strong or clever, and she trips over her own feet. Hedvig’s dad wonders if the woolly costume should instead go to her show-offy cousin. The good news is that Norway being one of the safest countries in the world, most of the town’s emergencies seem lemur-related (one of the little critters has escaped from the zoo). The low-level stakes make Just Super a gentle watch for little kids.And there’s a lot to like. Perhaps owing to the fact that Norway – that gleaming northern utopia – is one of the world’s most equal as well as safest countries, it feels feminist by instinct; no annoyingly laboured girl power on show here. Less original is the “be yourself” message, which even five-year-olds kids may groan at. And at points I did wonder if it’s a teeny bit lacking in fun. Like a week of eating lentils, you know it’s good for you, but a little bit of dullness creeps in. Just Super is released on 4 August in UK cinemas."
Psycho-Pass: Providence review – anime thriller investigates dark side of technology,Japanese studio Production IG’s conspiracy noir is a fabulous-looking tale influenced by Blade Runner,3,"With the iconic 1995 Ghost in the Shell in their locker, Japan’s Production IG studio has been a long way ahead of the curve on the now-inescapable AI and cybernetics front. This high-minded, operatic conspiracy-thriller anime, released for the Psycho-Pass franchise’s 10th anniversary, won’t do their reputation any harm. Often insightful about the dark impulses behind humankind’s need to delegate and cede to technology, it does a better job than most concept-drunk anime of parsing these philosophical musings into something semi-intelligible.In the dystopia of 2118, the Psycho-Pass is a Chinese-style social-credit chit given to every Japanese citizen assessing their psychological state and likelihood of breaking bad, all overseen for the good of social order by a benign AI called the Sibyl System. Inspector Tsunemori (voiced by Kana Hanazawa) is called in after the murder at sea of a researcher who is developing datasets related to ethnic conflicts abroad. With technologically quelled Japan debating how much it should intervene in chaotic countries outside its borders – hence the data’s value – a host of other government departments want to weigh in on the incident. Especially when the finger for the killing points to the Peacebreakers, a rogue covert ops unit led by a Kurtz-style fanatic.As Tsunemori and her partner Kogami (Tomokazu Seki) juggle these competing interests, director Naoyoshi Shiotani – a Psycho-Pass stalwart – ensures this noirish affair resonates with a packed zeitgeist tick-list: Japan’s historical isolation, current rearmament discussions, the interplay of determinism and free will in choosing how much tech should be incorporated into daily life. It is thought-provoking, but, to be honest, never deeply engaging as the hastily characterised central duo are subsumed into a horde of powerbrokers and apparatchiks.Whether 22nd-century gumshoe, sinister G-man or renegade cyborg, everyone in Psycho-Pass Providence looks noble, pallid and fabulous – and the action, mixing in CGI elements, has self-assurance. But, amid all the long gun battles in institutional hallways, there is no really outstanding set piece, and Shiotani turns in circles a bit too much around his obvious influence, Blade Runner (and, to a lesser extent, Minority Report). One highlight though is how his team draw hand-to-hand combat: precise, methodical and bristling, as if supporting the film’s message that the human touch is still worth something. Psycho-Pass Providence is released on 2 August in UK and Irish cinemas."
The Unabridged Mrs Vera’s Daybook review – lovable profile of drag-artist campaigners,Straightforward telling of artists David Faulk and Michael Johnstone’s story of love and activism is warm and heartfelt,4,"Sometimes a hat festooned with plastic straws, Christmas tree baubles and random trash is more than just a hat festooned with plastic straws, Christmas tree baubles and random trash: it’s a political statement – well, sort of. This vivid, effervescent and often moving documentary revolves around David Faulk and Michael Johnstone, two artists who found each other in the middle of the Aids pandemic, fell in love and ended up building not just a life together but a wider community around the drag persona Mrs Vera.The latter is incarnated by Faulk, clad like a psychedelic Joan of Arc in an armour of upcycled polyester and tchotchkes, under a thick impasto of makeup – not unlike the inch-thick layers of paint he used to apply on canvases back in his days as a New York-based artist. But once he moved to San Francisco and started making art with life partner Johnstone, the expanding Verasphere became about so much more than just performance. It’s a whole multimedia construction, involving Johnstone’s luminous photographs, film-making, collaborations with friends and allies and, most endearing of all, craft workshops where Faulk and Johnstone teach people how to wield glue guns like real pros as prep for the city’s annual Pride march. The couple’s innate kindness and generosity shines bright, while the miracle of their survival (both have been HIV positive for years and Johnstone almost died) allowed them time to become local legends and fairy godmothers for the community.The entwined subjects are so lovable it’s hard not to warm to the film, even if the direction (by Robert James) is very linear and conventional. Nevertheless, it modulates elegantly as it swerves between the story of Faulk and Johnstone as individuals and a condensed history of the post-Stonewall era, stitching together the rise of HIV and Aids, the Names Project Aids Memorial Quilt, and the queer scenes of New York’s East Village and San Francisco’s Castro Street. There’s plenty of pithy input from Verasphere friends, including performance artist Annie Sprinkle and singer-actor Mark Trevorrow AKA Bob Downe. The Unabridged Mrs Vera’s Daybook is released on 1 August on digital platforms."
Perhaps What I Fear Does Not Exist review – an intimate document of family tragedy,Lebanese director Corine Shawi captures the warmth and friction of her family as they deal with her father’s sudden hospitalisation,3,"With its piles of white sheets and whirring machines, the inside of a hospital room can feel oddly impersonal under the cold fluorescent light. Giving a poignant warmth to this sterile environment, this compelling documentary from Lebanese director Corine Shawi intimately captures how her family comes together during a time of tragedy. Struck by sudden paralysis, her father, Andre, is confined to bed and Shawi’s film grapples with this state of reduced mobility as well as her own emotional stasis, caught between the past, the present and the future.As it examines Andre’s hospital room, the camera tenderly observes how the space is transformed into a second home. Containers of food lovingly prepared by Shawi’s mother are stacked by the bed, while the radio hums his favourite songs. The film does not shy away from moments of uncomfortable friction, either, as Andre’s frustration and Shawi’s helplessness erupt in arguments and sudden emotional outbursts. However, as Andre braves lengthy sessions of physical therapy with a smiling resilience, it is Shawi, not her father, who needs more courage to deal with this difficult new reality.This brings us back to the film’s beautifully enigmatic title, which gets at the heart of Shawi’s crisis. During one particularly momentous conversation, Shawi’s sister advises that she should also follow her own dreams, instead of being tethered to the needs of their admirably self-sufficient parents. Like the film’s recurring images of a hand peeling off dried tree-bark to reveal a fresh surface underneath, the film appears to seek the same kind of renewal. Perhaps What I Fear Does Not Exist is available from 4 August on True Story."
Everybody Loves Jeanne review – salty romcom with intriguing edge of quirk,"The stylish feature debut from Céline Devaux explores the life of businesswoman Jeanne, her louche ex-lover and a strangely seductive new acquaintance",3,"Parisian film-maker and illustrator Céline Devaux, whose award-winning shorts have been shown at Cannes and Venice, now makes her feature debut with a salty romcom character study; it is deceptively slight, though leaning heavily on a certain kind of quirkiness, and undoubtedly intriguing.Jeanne is an entrepreneur who has fallen into a depression caused by the death of her mother and the recent bizarre collapse of her business; she has an inner anxiety-voice represented by Devaux’s own sketches of the cartoon-ghost in her head, always nagging at her. An undersea device for hoovering up microplastics, into which Jeanne invested every cent of her own money, became unmoored and Jeanne was humiliatingly shown on the TV news as she desperately dived fully clothed into the sea in a doomed attempt to save it. She is played by Blanche Gardin – who was Léa Seydoux’s producer and best friend in Bruno Dumont’s media satire France – and brings a certain kind of not-yet-irretrievable jadedness to the role.Jeanne can now rescue herself from bankruptcy by selling her late mother’s Lisbon flat, a place with so many painful memories – but in journeying to Portugal she has to deal with her slightly louche ex-boyfriend Vitor (Nino Lopes). At the airport she meets a very strange guy called Jean (Laurent Lafitte) – apparently a school contemporary – who says some bold, odd, and yet weirdly seductive things to her.At first, it seems that this is going to be extremely ironic comedy about a creepy acquaintance from schooldays, or even a psychological thriller in the vein of Dominik Moll’s Harry, He’s Here to Help. But in his unfiltered, unguarded way, Jean opens up about mental health issues that seem far from resolved (he actually steals a motorbike in the course of the action without getting into trouble, an interestingly transgressive scene).The movie just rolls along, with entertaining setpiece scenes about Jean, Vitor and Jeanne’s amiable brother Simon (Maxence Tual). The film also uses children – Simon’s son, and Jean’s niece – with great charm and Jeanne’s vulnerabilities are tenderly portrayed. Everybody Loves Jeanne is released on 27 July on Mubi in the UK and on 7 September in Australian cinemas."
Baato review – astonishing 500-mile walk to bring herbs to market in Nepal,This documentary about women who make an epic annual trek across a rocky mountain pass draws an intriguing contrast between the vast landscapes and intimate family dynamics,3,"Baato – “the path” in Nepali – is the extraordinary journey taken annually by villagers living in rural Nepal, as they transport huge bundles of medicinal herbs to the city of Dharan for sale. Following a tradition that has existed for more than a century, Mikma and her family cover a distance of 300 miles by foot over five arduous days. Wrapped around steep and rocky mountains, the trails are treacherous and gruelling, while the obstacles they face are more than physical: they have to deal with administrative hassle, corruption and infrastructure development.Closely following this resilient group of travellers – which largely consists of women carrying enormous loads on their shoulders with astonishing ease – the film draws a striking contrast between the scenery of Nepali highlands and the intimate dynamics of Mikma’s family. As they take the occasional breaks for food and rest, their spirited conversations attest to the growing tension between tradition and modernity. The absence of young men on these annual treks is a prime example of this tug-and-pull; many have left the village for a brighter economic future elsewhere.More than a family portrait, Lucas Millard and Kate Stryker’s film also widens its scope to take in the complex geopolitics of Nepal. The generational shifts are not only felt within the community, but also embedded in the changing landscapes that surround the villagers. The (very) slow construction of a new highway promises greater accessibility to metropolitan areas and new employment opportunities, but the project comes with the threat of displacement and inadequate compensation for rural dwellers. Baato is released on 28 July in UK cinemas."
John Farnham: Finding the Voice review – a gushy account of Australian music history,"This eulogistic documentary has Farnham’s blessing, but we learn very little about the man himself as everyone else reflects on his career",3,"The biggest question I had going into director Poppy Stockell’s documentary about the beloved Australian singer John Farnham is: how many times will it deploy that song? You know, the one reminding us that we’re all someone’s daughter, we’re all someone’s son. The song that arrived in 1986 and became seared on to the national psyche, to be played and replayed ad infinitum, and may God curse the swinish face of any so-called ’Strayan who doesn’t like it.Will You’re the Voice be played once? Twice? Will it be reserved for the last act? How long can we look at each other keep watching a Farnesy doco without hearing this amazingly catchy tune about standing up to injustice? The answer is: about halfway through the runtime. But even then we hear the song in pieces, as the story around it is recounted.The tone of Finding the Voice is fawning: this is one of those gushy accounts of music history in which almost everybody has the Midas touch, and almost everybody is a legend and/or talking about a legend. It’s also one in which any serious exploration of the subject’s vices or moral failings are no-fly zones. The film is an authorised work with Farnham’s blessing – though he did not participate in an on-screen interview and is only occasionally heard, via audio that combines an interview conducted for the film with archival material.Stockell opens with vision of Australian society from the 1960s, accompanied by Olivia Newton-John describing the country at this time as “sheltered” and “very isolated from the rest of the world”. The film quickly segues into discussing music, with images of bars, clubs and nightlife chased by Jimmy Barnes asking: “Who was gonna be our big star? Who were we gonna worship?”The singer Bev Harrell describes Farnham as a “star in the making”. This kind of language is often used when discussing famous musicians, as if their success was preordained and not – as is most often the case – a combination of talent, luck and opportunity. Music producer David Mackay discusses how he convinced a young Farnham to record Sadie (The Cleaning Lady) because Mackay “knew it’d be No 1”. And voilà! This sad song, incongruously performed in a jovial spirit, became the biggest hit from an Australian recording artist in the 1960s.The ghost of poor ol‘ Sadie returned to haunt Farnham; she made him a star but not a respectable artist. Finding the Voice includes a section that recounts how Farnham was dropped by his record company and bottomed out doing crummy gigs with a band that couldn’t even keep time (when the inevitable biopic or miniseries arrives, this will be perfect for the dramatic curve downwards). But Farnham had the chance to turn the pages over (thank you, thank you) and took it when he discovered You’re the Voice, written by Chris Thompson, Andy Qunta, Keith Reid and Maggie Ryder.Thompson says he got the idea for the song when he overslept and missed a big march against nuclear disarmament (classic muso behaviour). He KBed Farnham’s request to record it, saying: “I said no, no! The only thing I knew about John Farnham was a song about Sadie the Cleaning Lady.” But Farnham and his team went ahead and recorded it anyway, among other things becoming the first time in human history that bagpipes have sounded almost tolerable. Here the story’s dramatic arc tilts up, up and up, towards massive crowds and superstardom.Finding the Voice has a very good energy and flow: editors Scott Gray and Steven Robinson make it fast and jumpy, like someone bouncing around at a concert. But it also keeps tumbling past bits that might’ve added more meat to the bone, reducing potentially interesting tangents to quick soundbites. Lines such as “John doesn’t like parties or gatherings” beg to be further explored, as does his depression, which is alluded to a few times but never properly addressed.Interviewees talk on behalf of Farnham, with commentary like “he was for the first time in control of his career and really he couldn’t be happier”. The vibes are a bit weird, as if the subject is no longer with us. While an authorised production, this film imparts an impression that Farnham contributed little to it. By the end we have a good overview of his career but not the man himself. Who is he? What are his values, insecurities, weaknesses, strengths? Farnham found his voice, but it’s not really in this film.John Farnham: Finding The Voice airs at 7.30pm on Monday 24 July on Channel 7 and will be available to stream on 7plus, and is released on 1 August on digital platforms in the UK"
Barbie: The Album review – a dream house of pop royalty gets all dolled up,(Warner)Dua Lipa and Charli XCX bring high camp to this Mark Ronson-produced movie mixtape that climaxes with the sugary filth of Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice’s Barbie World,4,"Pop’s perpetual Peter Pan Mark Ronson has assembled this glitzy doll’s house of pop royalty to soundtrack this summer’s biggest movie blockbuster, co-writing five tracks himself and producing a handful more. Viewed simply as an ensemble mixtape, it shines like a kaleidoscope in 20 shades of coral. But the accompanying film feels as though it’s straining to live its truth as a fully fledged musical, and as a result a few of the soundtrack’s starry contributors – Sam Smith, Tame Impala, Haim – can’t seem to decide whether they’re serving the gods of pop or narrative. Still, Ronson touches glory with the 11 o’clock number I’m Just Ken, launching Ryan Gosling’s pitch-corrected himbo into full masculine meltdown.For all the Midas touch he exhibits on Dua Lipa’s Dance the Night, Ronson the songwriter lacks a requisite sprinkling of saccharine camp for a job like this. Fortunately, this ingredient is amply lavished elsewhere: in the beeping BPMs of PinkPantheress and Ava Max, the gloriously artificial K-pop regiment Fifty Fifty, and the merciless hit merchant Charli XCX belting her irresistibly idiotic bop Speed Drive.Then just when it starts to feel like an orgy in a sweetshop, Billie Eilish arrives with some much-needed tragic relief. What Was I Made For? lends hushed sincerity to Barbie’s plight, and it’s this melody that Greta Gerwig repeatedly relies on to give her synthetic film a heart.Like the movie it decorates, the album strives for a fine balance of girlish innocence and knowing irony. Nicki Minaj long ago mastered this contradiction: half hyper-feminine babydoll, half foul-mouthed man-eater. So it’s no surprise that Barbie World, the song she shares with her protege Ice Spice, is 109 seconds of pure plastic bliss. Like much of the soundtrack, it fizzes with moreish, sugary filth, simultaneously R-rated and child-friendly."
Bird Box Barcelona review – outlandish Spanish take on the Netflix thriller,Prepare to suspend your disbelief (again) as the Pastor brothers relocate the Sandra Bullock-starring sci-fi dystopia to Barcelona,3,"The sequel to Bird Box, Susanne Bier’s hit 2018 Netflix sci-fi starring Sandra Bullock, Bird Box: Barcelona transposes pretty much the same premise – parent and child must seek out a safe haven from mysterious entities that cause overwhelming suicidal urges if you lay eyes on them – to a post-apocalyptic version of Barcelona. Mario Casas plays Sebastián, a doting father who is driven to desperate acts out of love for his daughter, Anna (Alejandra Howard).This instalment is co-written and directed by Spain’s Pastor brothers, who are old hands when it comes to dystopian science-fiction scenarios triggered by preposterous events. Their 2013 feature The Last Days hinged on a viral epidemic that caused a paralysing fear of open spaces; Carriers (2009) followed four friends seeking refuge from an airborne plague. With Bird Box: Barcelona, as with any film of this outlandish ilk, suspension of disbelief and an appreciation of propulsively destructive action sequences is key. Just don’t expect too many fresh ideas.On Netflix"
While We Watched review – nerve-jangling portrait of an Indian reporter holding​ the ruling party to account,TV anchor Ravish Kumar calls out the propaganda that passes for news – and faces the consequences of challenging Modi – in this essential documentary,4,"Prime minister Narendra Modi’s India is a country that is both fiercely patriotic and increasingly divided. Stirred up by wasps’ nest rhetoric and stoked by a news media that regurgitates the Modi position wholesale, it is not a country that takes kindly to anyone who dares hold the ruling party to account.But a few courageous journalists persist in asking questions. Ravish Kumar, at the time of filming a television anchor and reporter for the station NDTV and the subject of this nerve-jangling documentary, is one. Captured by a jittery camera, the measured, eloquent Kumar calls out the propaganda that passes for news. He resists militaristic cheerleading to focus instead on the human stories – the job losses, the lack of basic infrastructure, the rubbish that piles up in the streets. Meanwhile, moments of peace with his young daughter are interrupted by his phone, delivering a torrent of death threats and accusations of “anti-nationalism”. And his underfunded newsroom haemorrhages staff members.This is tense, essential film-making that argues for the importance of serious, balanced journalism in today’s world of factional infotainment, while also showing the cost to those who stand against the tide."
Medusa review – body fascists on the loose in heady satire on Brazil’s police state,Anita Rocha da Silveira’s genre-bending tale of masked religious vigilantes is a genre film with something to say,4,"With its squishy synth soundtrack, candy-coloured teen environs and role-playing girl-gang violence, this second feature from Brazilian writer-director Anita Rocha da Silveira feels like a time-warped precursor to Heathers, Clueless and The Neon Demon. It’s a satirical nightmare inspired by the giallo of Dario Argento, fired by the rise of former president Jair Bolsonaro’s reactionary populism and campily refracted through the televangelising aesthetic of The Eyes of Tammy Faye. Having racked up a string of international festival prizes (Miami, Tromsø, Sitges, San Sebastián) since premiering at Cannes in 2021, Medusa builds on the promise of Da Silveira’s genre-subverting 2015 feature debut, Kill Me Please, confirming its creator as a killer talent to watch.We open with a video of spider-walking strangeness; a writhing dance watched on a phone by a black-fingernailed figure who is promptly set upon by masked female assailants. “Jezebel! We’ll nail you to the cross,” they cry, before beating their victim into promising to “accept Jesus… [and] become a devoted, virtuous woman”, then posting her bloodied submission online. These are the “Treasures”, a cheesy evangelical vocal group with a sideline in biblical violence, whose male counterparts the “Watchmen” train for morality-police duties with peacocking capoeira routines. While news reports about blackouts and rationing burble away in the background, these soldiers of God (who echo real-life Brazilian vigilantes, male and female) fight the good fight against progressive society with a twisted fervour reminiscent of the frothing QAnon insurrectionists who stormed the US Capitol on 6 January in 2021.Behind the Treasures’ assaults is the quasi-mythical story of Melissa, a free spirit who “tainted our town” by doing a nude scene in a movie, and whose face was subsequently set on fire by an anonymous avenging angel. Permanently scarred, Melissa disappeared from view. Now Mariana (Mari Oliveira) vows to track her down – an endeavour in which she is encouraged by queen bee Michele (Lara Tremouroux), who posts online tutorials on burning issues such as “how to take a perfect Christian selfie”. Agreeing that a snapshot of Melissa’s melted face would be a warning to sinners everywhere, Mariana goes undercover, infiltrating a home for coma patients. But once inside the institution’s cloistered corridors, she discovers (like the heroine of Suspiria before her) more than she bargained for.Da Silveira has described the body-fascist protagonists of her film, one of whom loses her beauty-industry job because “looks are everything”, as having been indoctrinated with “a form of control” – a desperate attempt to master their desires that “starts through their own bodies and extends to the bodies of others”. It’s a neat metaphor for the suffocating zealousness that orders these disordered lives – an obsessive need to smother carnal urges and temptations beneath a veneer of steely sanctity. No wonder everyone’s smile teeters on the brink of a scream, just as horror skirts the edges of satire.From the masks of Georges Franju’s Les yeux sans visage (Eyes Without a Face) to the mass hysteria of Ken Russell’s The Devils and the strutting street violence of Stanley Kubrick’s A Clockwork Orange, Da Silveira fills the screen with nods to a cine-literate heritage of cult classics, updated for the Instagram age. Demonstrating a keen ear for a twisted pop tune (Wishing on a Star is weirdly weaponised; Baby It’s You is painted black) and a sharp eye for piercingly orchestrated visuals (plaudits to director of photography João Atala), she deftly conjures a 21st-century parable about misogyny, hypocrisy and political chicanery, all dressed in the enjoyably outre clothing of Lynchian dream-logic horror.Yet for all its multitudinous reference points, this remains very much Da Silveira’s movie – as distinct and pointed as Ana Lily Amirpour’s A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night or Julia Ducournau’s Raw­ – a genre film with something to say, and a unique voice with which to say it."
"The Tunnel to Summer, the Exit of Goodbyes review – sumptuously romantic YA anime",Tomohisa Taguchi’s elegant love story anchors the far-fetched plot points of Makoto Shinkai’s 2016 hit Your Name,4,"A pair of Japanese teenagers are flung together thanks to a metaphysical glitch that bends the rules of space and time in this sumptuously romantic YA anime. And if this all sounds suspiciously close to the premise of Makoto Shinkai’s box-office phenomenon Your Name, that’s unlikely to be a coincidence. The success of that film – Your Name was the third highest-grossing Japanese film of all time – led to a rash of similarly high concept sci-fi romance animations (most recently Shinkai’s own esoteric fantasy Suzume) hoping to repeat the magic. But of all the movies that followed, Tomohisa Taguchi’s The Tunnel to Summer, the Exit of Goodbyes is the one that comes closest to recreating the glistening perfection of Your Name.Based on a novel and subsequent manga by Mei Hachimoku, the film follows Kaoru (voiced by Oji Suzuka), a reserved high school student who discovers a mysterious tunnel that, according to local folklore, can grant your dearest wishes, albeit at a considerable cost. Around the same time, a friendship sparks with the new girl at school, Anzu (Marie Iitoyo), who shares his fascination with the tunnel. Anzu is an unrepentant badass, an aspiring manga artist who floors the school mean girl with a punch on her first day in class, and accuses the flustered Kaoru of being a creep.This elegant romance anchors its more far-fetched plot points with delicately observed details and grounding moments: a battered, borrowed umbrella that becomes a motif in the story; shy, stolen glances exchanged through floppy fringes; fingers tentatively entwined as the sky explodes with fireworks and longing."
Elemental review – Pixar’s fire-and-water romance struggles to ignite,"There’s plenty of visual energy in this star-crossed animation set in a segregated city, but the love story’s a fizzling affair",3,"The latest animation from Pixar takes a high-concept setup – a sprawling metropolis, Element City, in which the residents, all made of either fire, water, air or earth, live in strictly segregated neighbourhoods – to explore a universal theme: the need for cultural acceptance and harmony. At the heart of the story is a star-crossed romance between hot-headed fire girl Ember (voiced by Leah Lewis) and sappy, sweet-natured water guy Wade (Mamoudou Athie). And perhaps it’s ludicrous to complain about the authenticity of a relationship between a woman made of flame and an entirely liquid man, but there’s little persuasive chemistry between them. There are tonal parallels with Pixar’s Inside Out and Zootropolis, but while it has a peppy visual energy, Elemental lacks the wildly inventive storytelling of the former and the laughs of the latter."
Name Me Lawand review – remarkable documentary about a deaf Kurdish boy in the UK,"Edward Lovelace uses impressionistic techniques to capture the world of Lawand as he learns to communicate in this moving, inspirational tale",4,"Born profoundly deaf in Iraqi Kurdistan, Lawand had little hope of a fulfilling life if he stayed in the country of his birth. His disability was stigmatised, and there was no infrastructure in place to support him. With their son’s wellbeing in mind, his parents made the wrenching decision to make the perilous journey to the UK with the then five-year-old Lawand and his older brother Rawa. There, Lawand was enrolled at the Royal School for the Deaf in Derby, and he thrived, achieving fluency in British Sign Language, making friends. Then the unthinkable happened: Lawand and his family were threatened with deportation.Even without documentary director Edward Lovelace’s inventive approach, this would be a potent and powerful story. But what’s particularly impressive is the way that, through immersive techniques involving sound, and skittish editing that evokes fractured, traumatic memory snippets, the film tries to capture Lawand’s lived experience. It’s a remarkable achievement, a film that, with its poetic sensitivity and creativity, has a strong kinship with Peter Middleton and James Spinney’s Notes on Blindness."
The Damned Don’t Cry review – impressive tale of a Moroccan ​single mother and son living on the margins,Fyzal Boulifa’s intense drama about this unusually tight family unit fleeing scandal and debt is a painterly triumph,4,"There’s a claustrophobic, smothering love between sex worker Fatimah-Zahra (Aicha Tebbae) and her teenage son Selim (Abdellah El Hajjouji), both forced to live on the unforgiving periphery of Morocco’s conservative society. It’s the kind of close but fractious relationship that comes from being a self-contained, self-sufficient family unit – mother and son are constantly on the move, fleeing debts, disgrace or the scandal that seems to trail after Fatimah-Zahra like a cheap perfume. But now they are out of options, and, after a stormy reunion with Fatimah-Zahra’s estranged family, Selim learns the uncomfortable truth about his paternity. His anger at his mother is scalding and destructive; it is, we sense, partly driven by the fact that Selim and Fatimah-Zahra are more alike than he would ever admit.Fyzal Boulifa’s follow-up to his acclaimed debut Lynn + Lucy, The Damned Don’t Cry is impressive on every level. The performances are full-blooded and lived in; the camera finds a painterly beauty even in moments of despair and squalor. And the score, a discordant duel between cello and harp, cleverly evokes the disharmony between mother and son.In cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema"
Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One review – Tom Cruise is still taking our breath away,"With star turns from Vanessa Kirby and Hayley Atwell, plus a zeitgeisty AI plot, this seventh MI outing is one of the most exhilarating yet",4,"MI goes AI in this seventh outing for the TV-series-turned-action-cinema-franchise, a genuinely breathtaking romp that tops the previous Christopher McQuarrie-directed episodes (2015’s Rogue Nation, 2018’s Fallout) for sheer nailbiting spectacle and pulse-racing tension. The zeitgeisty plot may have holes through which you could drive the Orient Express, but for pure adrenaline rush entertainment this will leave you exhilarated and eager for more.Three decades ago, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) sold his soul to the IMF (“no, the other IMF – the Impossible Mission Force”), a covert organisation whose oath demands that its members “live and die in the shadows for those we hold close and those we never meet”. Since then, Hunt has saved the world more than once (his last mission involved neutralising nuclear bombs). But now he’s up against everyone’s favourite enemy de nos jours – a fiendish artificial intelligence known as “the Entity”, a name that will sound sillier every time it is spoken out loud (and it is spoken out loud a lot).It’s hardly a new idea. Jack Paglen’s script for 2014’s 70s-influenced Transcendence dramatised the “singularity” (the point at which technology out-thinks humankind) a decade ago, paving the way for MI7’s sentient viral intelligence (“this thing has a mind of its own?!”), which is “everywhere and nowhere… godless, stateless, amoral”, controlling and manipulating information so that “truth as we know it is in peril”.Somehow, this very modern threat has a very old-fashioned key – a weird, crucifix-shaped dongle that (like Archimedes’s Antikythera in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny) has been split into two pieces that must be reunited to unlock its secrets. “Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to bring us the key,” declares the familiar self-destructing tape, the IMF having apparently shunned new-fangled voicemail or encrypted WhatsApp messages. Later, they will retreat to the safety of an offline analogue room – the one place the Entity can’t get to them.Warring forces wish to own the Entity, to control and weaponise it. Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) apparently holds part of the puzzle – which puts a price on her head, because “the fate of the world depends on finding whatever it unlocks” – thus sending Hunt off in globetrotting pursuit. The pre-credits sequence alone takes us from a submarine in the Bering Strait to a horseback chase through the desert, en route to a sandstorm shootout with brief stopovers in Amsterdam and elsewhere. We also get an early reminder that we’re back in a world in which rubbery masks are realistic enough to get Jason Statham believing in the Face/Off machine again.There’s plenty of caperish comedy afoot, particularly after Hunt teams up with Hayley Atwell’s light-fingered Grace. A handcuffed car-chase featuring a Fiat 500 careening down Rome’s Spanish Steps recalls the Mini-fuelled fun of The Italian Job (with a cheeky nod towards Battleship Potemkin), while the wisecracking interaction between Cruise and Atwell has a nice, old-school screwball flavour.Elsewhere, the join-the-dots plot includes a James Bond-style mission to a lavish party where a scene-stealingly cracked Vanessa Kirby warns that “truth is vanishing – war is coming”, a prologue to a Don’t Look Now-style chase through the alleyways of Venice. Esai Morales, who proved so chilling in Ozark, nails another villainous role as Gabriel, a “dark messiah” who is “the Entity’s chosen messenger”. As for Cruise, he may still have the physical fitness of a less-than-40-year-old, but he’s also developed a Richard Gere-style blinky squint of late, which adds a touch of melancholy maturity to his otherwise boyish charm.The action is impressively gender neutral, with men and women killing and dying with equal relish (plaudits to Pom Klementieff, whose relentless – and largely silent – assassin, Paris, could give Grace Jones in A View to a Kill a run for her money). It all builds to a frankly jaw-dropping train-bound finale in which the heavily trailered sight of the real Tom Cruise really driving a real motorbike off a real mountaintop is only an appetiser for what is to come – one of the most audaciously extended action set pieces I have ever seen, which left my nails not so much bitten as gnawed to the bone. The fact that this is “only the beginning” is cause for celebration. Roll on Dead Reckoning Part Two.In cinemas from 10 July"
"Small, Slow But Steady review – unsentimental Japanese drama about a young deaf boxer","The true story of a self-doubting female fighter battling through pandemic lockdown benefits from a muted, naturalistic approach",3,"Subdued, low-key and unassuming, this Japanese film about a young deaf woman who becomes a professional boxer firmly eschews the traditional sports movie tropes. Based on a true story, it is resolutely unsentimental, taking a meditative and naturalistic approach to the tale of Keiko (Yukino Kishii). She isn’t an obvious fighter. “She’s small, she has no reach, she’s not fast enough,” says the owner of her gym, her biggest supporter, “but she’s got heart.” Even heart and dogged determination, however, might not be enough to keep Keiko going once the pandemic shuts the gym and self-doubt shakes her focus.In cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema"
"Hello, Bookstore review – life-affirming documentary about a US literary haven",A venerable Massachusetts bookshop and its hippy owner struggle through the pandemic in AB Zax’s engagingly quirky portrait,3,"Does the inside of a bookshop take on the personality of its owner? Or does a bookseller inevitably become a storyteller by a process of osmosis over the decades spent surrounded by the printed word? In the case of Matthew Tannenbaum, the subject of this quietly life-affirming documentary, it’s almost impossible to pinpoint the place where the man ends and his treasure trove of a shop begins. The Bookstore in Lenox, Massachusetts, is a beloved local institution. Tannenbaum knows most of his customers by name. Those he doesn’t recognise are treated like friends yet to be made. The decor is eclectic (there’s a roll of Donald Trump toilet paper displayed); the shop’s finances run on a wing and a prayer. Then comes the pandemic. The community support for the embattled shop surprises nobody, except, perhaps Tannenbaum, the ageing hippy whose love of literature is evident on every groaning shelf.In cinemas and on Apple TV+"
"Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken review – ​likable if slight coming-of-age cartoon​",A teenage girl learns she’s not like other students in DreamWorks’ fish-out-of-water tale​ with a top voice cast​,3,"American high school is a shark pit at the best of times. But it’s particularly tough if, like Ruby Gillman (voiced by Lana Condor), you are a member of a family of krakens – blue-skinned, tentacled, invertebrate sea creatures – who have been passing as human for the past 15 years. And while Ruby thought that negotiating prom was her main challenge, it turns out that her mother (Toni Collette) hasn’t been entirely straight with her. Ruby has a monster-size problem.Key to understanding it all is the grandmother she never knew she had, a warrior queen of the ocean, voiced with relish by Jane Fonda. The latest picture from DreamWorks Animation is a likable if slight story of teen crises, which combines the adolescent body-morphing themes of Turning Red with the fish-out-of-water story of Luca, plus an amusing pot shot at mermaids, little and otherwise (take that, Disney!)."
La Syndicaliste review – French ​sexual abuse thriller takes cheap shots,Isabelle Huppert plays a whistleblower who is assaulted in this crass adaptation of a shocking true story,2,"Based on a true story, this slippery and rather disingenuous French-language thriller explores the case of Maureen Kearney (Isabelle Huppert, a little too impassive and icy), a high-powered union official for a major player in France’s nuclear power industry. When Maureen gets wind of a deal that could lead to massive job losses in the sector, she unilaterally declares war on the powers that be, petitioning politicians and making some very powerful enemies in the process. But when Maureen is violently sexually assaulted in her own home, the initial sympathy and shock within the industry turns to suspicion when the police accuse her of faking the attack.It’s not unusual, unfortunately, for the victims of sexual attacks to find themselves distrusted and even accused. What rankles in the film’s approach is that the audience is also encouraged to question her story, with director Jean-Paul Salomé seeding the picture with doubts about the veracity of Maureen’s initial version of the events, even as it shows her vindicated in the end. It feels crass and manipulative to cast aspersions on the tale of a real-life rape victim in service of a narrative twist in a movie."
The American Sector review – US road trip to hunt down remnants of the Berlin Wall ,This film tells the story of concrete slabs that have been rehomed thousands of miles away in bizarre yet unremarkable locations,4,"Tracking down various segments of the Berlin Wall scattered all over the US, this eccentric yet down-to-earth documentary from Courtney Stephens and Pacho Velez traces how a historic artefact can mutate and splinter into myriad meanings. Transformed by their surroundings as well as the film-makers’ gaze, these concrete slabs are more than a symbol of the cold war; they have come to represent something quintessentially American.From the midwest to California, state department halls to roadside restaurants, chunks of the wall can be found in the most unlikely of places. Most often positioned as a commemoration of history – and that loaded concept of “freedom” – the fragments are occasionally entirely untethered from their context, re-erected decoratively inside a Microsoft office or in the home of a private collector.Using 16mm film stock, the documentary has the feel of William Eggleston’s studies of mundane Americana. As the camera lingers on ordinary spaces such as a hotel lobby, the presence of a section of the wall is simultaneously bizarre and unremarkable. After all, there is nothing more American than the commodification of history.In addition to its offbeat locations, this cinematic road trip offers the film-makers’ interactions with those who live or work around the edifices. One particularly revelatory sequence centres on a phone call between Stephens and the CIA; while denying the crew permission to film inside their headquarters in Langley, Virginia, the CIA representative segues unexpectedly into a candid suggestion that the end of the cold war left the organisation in existential limbo. Such conversations bring a human unpredictability to the solemn wreckage of history. The American Sector is available from 30 June on True Story."
Against the Tide review – old ways vs the new in a study of modern Indian fisherfolk,"Seafaring friends from Mumbai cope with a changing climate and an unforgiving economy in different ways in Sarvnik Kaur’s poetic, beautifully shot documentary ",4,"Sarvnik Kaur’s patient, plangent documentary follows two fishers and friends from Mumbai’s Koli community pursuing their livelihoods by different means. Ganesh is a likable grafter who commands a large crew and the latest technology for expeditions far out at sea. He lives in a modern apartment with his wife, Manali, and zooms around town in a van that has his Instagram handle – The Last Fisherman of Bombay – emblazoned on the side.In contrast, the humble Rakesh, who lives with his wife, Devyani, their baby son and his mother-in-law, adheres to traditional Koli methods, trusting in his ancestors and restricting himself to shallow waters and a modest boat. In nocturnal chats that punctuate the film, the cultural and economic chasm between the two men is exposed. Ganesh encourages his friend to broaden his horizons, but Rakesh’s ambitions are limited to the dream of having a toilet at home.Kaur has said that, during production, one of her editors wanted to know who was the villain of the film. The strength of Against the Tide, though, lies in its even-handedness, its insistence that both men are at the mercy of the same capitalist and ecological catastrophes. Despite his poverty and his son’s poor health, it is Rakesh who emerges as the more resolute of the two, finding succour in his spirituality. The blingy Ganesh, meanwhile, is drowning in debt and considering downsizing his operations. He is going to need a smaller boat.Kaur and her cinematographer, Ashok Meena, are alert to every possible tension and nuance, although it would have been nice to see some interaction, however brief, between Manali and Devyani. An especially poetic image early in the film appears to show Rakesh walking on water, but it is only a trick of the light; the dawn is glistening on the rippled wet sand as he strides across it while the tide is out, leaving beached boats far behind him. Even after our eyes adjust to reality, though, the aura of the miraculous lingers on. Against the Tide is released on 30 June at Bertha DocHouse, London, with an Australian release date to be confirmed."
The Super 8 Years review – deeply personal documentary of Annie Ernaux’s family breakdown,The French writer’s lucid narration lends profundity to these scrappy home videos shot over a decade,3,"A decade’s worth of the 8mm home videos of the French author and Nobel laureate Annie Ernaux forms the basis of this delicate and very personal documentary. Co-directed by Ernaux and her son, David Ernaux-Briot, it’s a wisp of a thing, little more than an hour long. But Ernaux’s lucid, perceptive narration brings a more profound significance to the scrappy, amateurish reels shot by her late ex-husband, Philippe Ernaux. The slow-motion breakdown of a family is tracked by a lens that initially sought out intimacy and celebration, but finds itself, as the years pass, increasingly distanced from figures caught in its time capsule of a frame."
The Last Rider review – a Tour de France triumph like no other,A likable protagonist and a tense final act make this account of Greg LeMond’s improbable victory in 1989 exciting and affecting,3,"Two key elements are required if a sports documentary is to connect with audiences beyond the existing fans: a likable central character who has battled seemingly insurmountable odds to achieve success and a nail-biting final act. The Last Rider, Alex Holmes’s account of American cyclist Greg LeMond’s incredible triumph in the 1989 Tour de France, contains both. LeMond had previously won the gruelling race, in 1986, so he wasn’t a complete outsider. However, he had nearly lost his life in a shooting accident in 1987 and been written off as a serious contender in the race. It’s a conventional documentary, but a quality one. Spectacular archive footage from the event captures an inescapable sense of excitement – infectious, even to cycling agnostics in the audience – and interviews with LeMond and his wife, Kathy, are unexpectedly affecting."
She Came from the Woods review – jolly romp raising the ghosts of 80s teen horror,Summer-fun-and-slashing tale of camp counsellors in bloody peril has clear cinematic ancestors but the young cast gives it fresh appeal,3,"This silly but pleasingly jolly horror film offers an update on that perennial staple of the genre: the summer camp beset by a supernatural malignancy. And much like a campfire tale tailor-made to terrify impressionable listeners, this has a streak of self-referentiality that makes it feel ludic as well as lurid. After a 1940s-set prologue that’s explained later, the story settles into the 1980s, a time when this sort of summer-fun-and-slashing package with a large ensemble cast was all the rage (see Sleepaway Camp, The Burning, and of course the Friday the 13th series).It’s the last day of the season at Camp Briarbrook, and the assorted kids get ready to head home after one last performance-assembly in the mess hall. The camp counsellors, who predictably span the spectrum from theatre nerds and dweebs to glossy teen beauties ripe for terrorising, are also psyched to spend the night partying once the kids are gone. The camp’s owners – paterfamilias Gilbert McCalister (William Sadler), his daughter (Cara Buono, Dr Miller in Mad Men), and her two sons Shawn (Tyler Elliot Burker) and Peter (Spencer List) – look on indulgently, little realising that by the end half of them will be murdered or at least traumatised one way or another. Is the mayhem caused by the undead spirit of camp nurse Agatha (Madeleine Dauer), who bears a grudge for things Gilbert did in the 1940s? Or is there a more quotidian explanation like bears, a hornets’ nest or UFOs?Writer-director-editor Erik Bloomquist gamely takes the role of Danny, a lovelorn counsellor besotted with Kellie (Emily Keefe), and as anyone who’s ever seen a summer camp horror movie knows desire is always a deadly emotion in these films. Bloomquist gets great performances from the younger element of the cast, who are clearly having the most fun ever marauding wantonly in the third act as if someone spiked the lemonade with every E number and sugar product known to humanity. But finger snaps are especially due to Dan Leahy who plays counsellor Ben, an out-and-proud theatre geek who can both quip like a queen and scream with terror convincingly, the full thespian range required by the material. She Came from the Woods is released on 26 June on digital platforms."
Makeup review – secret life of a drag-artist banker underpins tender friendship tale,The story of an unlikely friendship between a city type and a haughty Frenchman has moments of genuine pathos but doesn’t quite feel real,2,"This low-key, low-budget portrait of an odd-couple friendship takes a while to get going, and never fully hits its stride – though it has its moments. Director Hugo André plays chef turned food blogger Sacha, a fastidious Frenchman living in London who rents a room in a house. His new landlord and flatmate is city banker Dan (Will Masheter), who seems to slot neatly into the stereotype of macho finance bro. But Dan turns out to have a secret life, dressing up in glittery glam frocks and feather boas, transforming into alter ego Danielle.A friendship of sorts develops between the two men, throwing up a couple of nice scenes. When Dan cooks soup, picky gourmand Sacha looks appalled in the way that only a Frenchman can at the claggy dollop of peanut butter slopped into his bowl. There’s a real sweetness, too, in Masheter’s performance as Dan begins to live more openly, tiptoeing into the world of cabaret – and, if nothing else, watching his self-expression blossom is a reminder of how sinister the anti-drag laws are that are currently sweeping the US.Elsewhere, some of the acting feels a bit broad and the film has some clumsy moments. The movie deals unconvincingly with a disciplinary procedure at Dan’s banking firm, where his line manager takes action that I’m certain no city boss would dare to, fearing an expensive lawsuit or bad publicity. Like a lot here, it feels distractingly a bit off and not quite real – or maybe just not thought through properly. Makeup is released on 26 June on digital platforms."
"Elemental review – fire and water fall in love in multicoloured, unworldly Pixar fable","Decent family entertainment set in the city of four elements, with a message of acceptance in bricks of colour and concepts as if originated via algorithm",3,"Here is a perfectly decent, personable family entertainment from Pixar, based around another of this studio’s oddly pedantic and algorithmically developed abstract high concepts: what if fire and water fell in love? It is also a star-crossed love story based on that most traditional of American themes: melting-pot diversity in the big city.The scene is another fabular alt-reality: Element City, a place of vivid colours and shapes like a toy held up in front of a newborn. Here, the creatures of the four elements – fire, water, earth and air – have come together to live, if not in harmony exactly, then a kind of boisterous acceptance. There is, however, a bigoted caste system that means that fire creatures are looked down on, maybe in the way the US’s northern European identities look down on people from hotter countries.Each of them comes from an old country where they were members of the only element-ethnicity. Bernie and Cindy Lumen (voiced by Ronnie Del Carmen and Shila Ommi) are hardworking first-generation fire immigrants who set up a store in the city’s Fire Town district. They have a smart, fiery-tempered teen daughter Ember (Leah Lewis), whom they hope will take over the business when they are gone.But left alone to mind the shop one day, Ember’s explosively combustible temper cracks the pipes, which have been amateurishly installed by her dad, and this brings a certain watery young man through the cracks. This is Wade Ripple (Mamoudou Athie), a government building inspector who really ought to penalise the Lumen family. But he’s a goofy, soppy romantic whose watery identity is represented chiefly by his tear ducts. There’s a funny scene showing his family playing what they call “the crying game” (nothing to do with Neil Jordan’s film of that name), in which they challenge each other to listen to a poignant story without bursting into tears.Wade falls in love with Ember, whose incendiary talent for turning sand into glass might yet prove to be the making of them both. To find happiness, Wade has to prove himself to Ember and also to her suspicious parents.It’s a bit silly, a bit surreal, a bit simplistic, and lands itself with the problem of how to show Ember being sad (which she sometimes is) and Wade being passionate (which he also sometimes is). But this film is surely pitched at much younger kids than a comparable Pixar film such as Inside Out, in which the separate moods inside us all were represented by different characters.The question of whether Pixar’s golden age is irrevocably behind us is now well-established and perhaps also misleading. In fact, Pixar has given us some outstanding films recently in Soul and Coco, and I am admittedly in a minority in thinking the Toy Story spin-off Lightyear is much better than it’s given credit for. But undoubtedly Elemental is another step away from the sophisticated brilliance of this studio’s glory days.Perhaps these multicoloured abstracts make the films sell better in international territories, but there is a worrying hint of PixarGPT about all this. Elemental seems to have been formulated with slightly chilling accuracy and the look of the movie is less interesting than it could have been. But having said that, a certain sweet, unworldly idealism in Elemental survives, the keynote of optimism – and this is the flame that Pixar has to keep alive. Elemental is out now in Australia and the US, and on 7 July in the UK"
Life Is More Important Than Art review – banality turns into poetry,"Whitechapel Gallery, LondonFrom snaps of car parks and train platforms to an operatic film showing people arriving at an airport, this show reveals that art is a particular way of looking at life",4,"Nearly 50 years ago, a young artist called John Smith took his camera to a street in Dalston, London, to film people going about their lives. Except that he pretended to construct and author this raw slice of reality. Over the black and white footage you hear Smith barking out commands like a director. “I want the man in the white boiler suit to come in from the left!” It’s funny and thought-provoking: what is is art, if not a moment in which we frame all the stuff going on in the world, and see it as if we were part of a vast fiction?Smith’s work forms part of the first exhibition at the Whitechapel Gallery in London under its new director, Gilane Tawadros. It’s a promisingly quirky, adventurous start by her, that challenges you to wonder what the difference between art and life is, if any. This is not exactly a new question. But it is asked here in a daring way that risks utter banality to unlock poetry.Smith’s 1976 conceptual art masterpiece The Girl Chewing Gum is its keynote, a British punk version of French New Wave cinema that suggests art is life, and life only. The parody directorial voice becomes increasingly deranged: a young man walking by in a rain coat has just robbed a bank and has a gun in his pocket. Then the kids in the cinema queue notice the camera and start looking at it, curious, amused and self-conscious. A moment of truth that transcends invention. It’s lovely.Much in the exhibition turns a direct mirror to the streets outside, in almost unmediated images of British urban life right now. Playing a similar game to Smith, Mitra Tabrizian’s Film Stills invite you to find a narrative in apparently chaotic, random photos of lockups and parked cars. Yet the depth of this show lies in seeing inwards, understanding that as we pass by each other, our memories and desires brush the air like ghostly shadows. Alia Syed crosses that border between outer existence and inner consciousness in her film Fatima’s Letter: against fleeting monochrome images of platforms and trains, we hear fragmented memories of migration and lost worlds, lost connections.That same sense of the infinite mystery hidden in the daily grind is given transcendent form by the classic of contemporary art that concludes this exhibition. Mark Wallinger’s Threshold to the Kingdom may be familiar to some but seeing it again makes you startled at how such a simple idea can be so profound. Wallinger fixes his camera on people coming out of the arrivals gate at an airport. Their smiles and the hugs of waiting friends, or their anxious, isolated faces, or confident strides, are shown in slow motion, lifesize, approaching you directly. Allegri’s Miserere plays majestically. And it is like seeing people enter heaven, a scene from a Last Judgment altarpiece, a canto written by Dante: so much poetry, taken from completely real, ordinary moments in modern lives. It makes the exhibition’s point perfectly: art is just looking, in a certain way, at life.There are good works aplenty, but the discovery here is the radical veteran John Smith. In 2020 Smith started filming over the rooftops from his window in the London borough of Hackney. There’s so much mist and snow in the opening shot that you can only see a white blankness above the houses. When that clears, the glass towers of the City loom and we hear Boris Johnson in the early weeks of 2020 talking dismissively about coronavirus. As the days pass his pronouncements get more alarmed. Smith carries on filming, spying on his neighbours as they move around their homes in lockdown. While Downing Street partied.It’s almost too real. Often, art is an escape – or at least a way of sublimating the mess of life, like Smith pretending to “direct” it in his early film. This exhibition wonders what it would be like if art was as true, as unvarnished, as a piece of chewing gum on asphalt. Refreshing, is the answer.Life Is More Important Than Art is at the Whitechapel Gallery, London, until 17 September"
The Blackening review – Get Out meets Scary Movie in whipsmart horror satire,The stereotype of Black characters dying first in horror movies is put to the test in a funny and incisive Juneteenth-set slasher,4,"There is an august tradition in the African American community of talking back to the film screen loud enough to jolt the characters on screen. The Blackening doesn’t just hear those cries; it needles its crowd for more reactions, bigger this time.From Tim Story, the director of Fantastic Four and Ride Along, the film starts with a group of college friends reuniting at a creaky woodland cabin – replete with drinks, drugs and marathon games of Spades. Premiering at last year’s Toronto film festival, Story’s feature releases this weekend pegged to Juneteenth – the emancipation holiday marking its second year in federal observance.Just when the love triangle between strait-laced Lisa (Dear White People’s Antoinette Robinson), fuckboy Nnamdi (House Party’s Sinqua Walls) and gay bestie Dewayne (the Emmy nominee Dewayne Perkins, who produced and co-wrote the film with Girls Trip’s Tracy Oliver) threatens to kill the vibe, half of the couple hosting the gala turns up dead (SNL’s Jay Pharoah); the fate of the other mate (Insecure’s Yvonne Orji) still hangs in the balance.The only way the friends can save her is by playing the Blackening, like Life meets Saw but with the most racist Monopoly man you’ve ever seen – a talking sambo doll face. Trivia categories run the gamut from basic TV (How many seasons did “Dark Aunt Viv” get on the Fresh Prince?) to advanced hip-hop math (How many blunts are there on Nas’s One Mic?) When the contest turns on a trick question the friends become fair game for the slaughter.The film’s fighting spirit is born from a recognizable brand of consciousness. Which is to say there is never a time when these Black people aren’t fully aware that they are in exactly the kind of situation that other Black people will scold them for getting into. Getting out of it means getting the small details right – down to turning a friend’s pistol grip from sideways to upright so the bullets actually hit the big bad. Having all Black characters just complicates the age-old genre problem of whom to kill off first, an idea Perkins first wrestled with in a 2018 sketch. Even Officer White (The Drew Carey Show’s Diedrich Bader) is hip to his particular dubiousness.The friends still make plenty of mortal mistakes – splitting up, going to a second location and turning on one another even as the audience urges them otherwise. But the blunders are easily excused because the characters making them are smartly drawn. King (House Party’s Melvin Gregg) is the thug turned peacemaker “balls deep in the sunken place” (his partner is white, you see) who nonetheless came on this trip packing heat. Allison (Empire’s Grace Byers) is the biracial militant whose beef with The Man traces to the suspicions she harbors toward her actual white father. Shanika (The Farewell’s X Mayo) oscillates from turn-up queen to voice of reason and back again.But the clear standout in this group is Clifton, the bespectacled two-time Trump voter some will strain to recognize as Jermaine Fowler – Coming 2 America’s heir aberrant. The time working with Eddie Murphy rubbed off on this character, a chip off the ol’ Jiff Ramsey. He stands in for the sheepish minority who have no idea how to play Spades, and no hope of learning from peers who treat the game as a cultural heirloom passed down only to the truly Black. Clifton’s response to that rejection is a strike for those at the cookout (ahem) who still don’t know how to play Spades – less a game of chance than of ESP, as The Blackening rightly makes clear. Never mind that most of us would be happy to exact revenge over a table of dominoes, still one of the easiest and most accessible games in the world.As a horror The Blackening isn’t the scariest. But that’s not the point of this film – a Fubu satire smack in the sweet spot between Get Out and Scary Movie. Explicitly comic while stopping just short of slapstick, it’s a film best seen in a theater with a Black audience that will sing along with Allison as she struggles through the second verse of Lift Every Voice (AKA the Black national anthem). The filmgoers at my Atlanta screening were never howling more than when Dewayne randomly dropped into the jingle for O’Reilly Auto Parts, the most surprising entry on the universal Black factboard by far.Where Michael Jackson’s Thriller and the Fugees’ Killing Me Softly With His Song winked at the very audience embracing them, The Blackening throws its arms around its crowd and squeezes hard. If you’re feeling at all frightened, it’s because you’re just not feeling the love.The Blackening is out in US cinemas on 16 June and in the UK on 25 August."
Man on Earth review – a beautifully humane documentary about a dying man’s last days,"Directed by Australian film-maker Amiel Courtin-Wilson, this compelling work follows Bob Rosenzweig’s decision to end his life through assisted dying",4,"There are lots of literal grey areas in the Australian film-maker Amiel Courtin-Wilson’s very compelling and heart-rending documentary about the final week of Bob Rosenzweig, a 65-year-old Jewish man living in Washington who has Parkinson’s disease and decides to end his life through assisted dying. From the opening shot Courtin-Wilson draws a stony overcast aesthetic, beginning with an ambiguous image of what seems to resemble a foggy, ashen skyline before a vague human outline emerges. Later there are shots of misty skylines and bodies of water more cement-coloured than blue; it’s as if the world around Rosenzweig is greying before his eyes, easing him through his last days.Courtin-Wilson and the cinematographer, Jac Fitzgerald, impressively texture the film in ways that make it feel stylish – but not so stylish as to detract from its impact. Man on Earth is an observational documentary that prioritises, above everything else, the subject and his circumstances. It’s pitched at just the right level of immersion: a soft, spectral glow veneering more conventional fly-on-the-wall elements such as handheld camerawork. The director has said in an interview that inspirations for the film’s palette include The Magpie by Monet, who was once described by John Berger in ways that perhaps also apply to Courtin-Wilson: an artist who “wanted to paint not things in themselves but the air that touched things”.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningWhat can’t be observed in Man on Earth in direct visual terms is the relationship between the director and his subject. The former bore a huge responsibility to the latter to tell his story responsibly and powerfully. And the latter was wise to entrust him: presumably Rosenzweig watched Courtin-Wilson’s other films, several of which are also built on striking collaborations with intriguing people from various walks of life. For instance the Australian-born Tibetan Buddhist nun Robina Courtin, who was the subject of 2000’s Chasing Buddha; the great Indigenous entertainer Jack Charles, who was the subject of 2008’s Bastardy; and Daniel P Jones, an ex-convict who plays a fictionalised version of himself in the strikingly gritty, yet intensely poetic, 2011 drama Hail.Courtin-Wilson introduces us to Rosenzweig in an odd way, showing him mid-sentence or mid-statement, saying: “And that’s what my new philosophy in life is – ah, fuck it.” There’s a feeling we might have arrived a smidge too late to fully appreciate what he’s saying. Which might be true in a broader sense too, in that it’s obvious the best days for this sharp and quick-witted individual, worn down by time and sickness, are far behind him. Rosenzweig – who designed bathrooms for the likes of Elton John and Janet Jackson, and hung out with celebrities including the Sex Pistols and Blondie – has been given six months to live.Sign up to Saved for LaterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsafter newsletter promotionThe rakishly thin Rosenzweig reflects on the intense chronic pain he experiences, and how “you really don’t have any concept of time when you have Parkinson’s” because “there’s no need to know what day it is”. One of his sons, Jessie, who is his carer, also comments on his condition, observing for instance how Parkinson’s “constantly forces your body to move” and thus constantly makes it burn energy. “Imagine swimming a hundred laps every hour,” he says. Rosenzweig is resolute that it is “absolutely the right time” to say goodbye, and he’s “ready to go”.Assisted dying allows the subject to make preparations and bid farewell to loved ones: a task Rosenzweig undertakes with bravery, introspection and a wee bit of cheeky humour. The cameras are there until the very end: in his home, perched by his deathbed. The film’s last 40 or so minutes in particular are – in a melancholic way – beautifully humane, but gosh it’s heartbreaking: tears were rolling down my face and I have no doubt many viewers will respond similarly. We all arrive at the same destination as Rosenzweig in the end, but not all of us shuffle off the mortal coil exhibiting such strength of character.

Greatest Days review – Take That musical offers blast of feelgood reunion excitement,"Aisling Bea rounds up old school friends to watch the reunited boyband in Athens and, amid the laughs, confront what happened when they last saw them 25 years ago",3,"A jukebox musical featuring the works of Take That might not ever be one for the cool kids; undoubtedly this is a bit broad, but it’s a splurge of feelgood from director Coky Giedroyc and screenwriter Tim Firth, adapting his own stage show, and it’s at least as enjoyable as the much-hyped Mamma Mia! movies.Aisling Bea gives it loads as Rachel, a hardworking NHS nurse who in her teen years was a massive Take That stan (as no one used to say in 1993) along with her four best mates from school. She is astonished one day to be phoned up by the local radio station and told she’s won a luxury all-inclusive deal for her and some guests to fly to Athens and see Take That on a reunion tour. This brings Rachel to a state of orgasmic excitement combined with a nervous breakdown as she realises she must round up the now middle-aged women she hasn’t seen for 25 years and they’ll all have to measure the joys and bittersweet disappointments of their lives against a Take That soundtrack. And she has to confront a painful memory connected to the last time they saw the band live in Manchester.There are laughs here: young Rachel turns on the TV in the 90s to see something on Ceefax about Britain’s bright future in the EU, the girls talk about how Take That’s “beach” video for Pray looks weirdly like a version of Lord of the Flies, and they bunk off school to see their mate take part in a high-diving competition holding up a massive inspirational banner in the spectators’ gallery, reading: “DON’T F*CK IT UP”. And we get a witty jump cut from the shot of Rachel’s boyfriend’s beaming face when he thinks that her “big news” is that she wants to get married, to his later face, realising this is about a Take That reunion concert, to which he is not in fact invited. Greatest Days screens in a one-night premiere on 15 June in UK and Irish cinemas, and goes on general release on 16 June."
Paradise Highway review – not even Juliette Binoche can save this stinker,A trucker being blackmailed by a criminal gang has to flee with the 12-year-old girl she was trafficking when the drop-off goes wrong. Cue Morgan Freeman,2,"Juliette Binoche is incapable of giving a bad performance, but here she is, probably as close as she’ll ever get to a stinker, playing a long-distance lorry driver on the wrong side of the law in Mississippi. For about five minutes there’s novelty watching La Binoche in trucker mode, wearing a bandana and filthy jeans, stomping around yelling “motherfucker” at anyone who messes with her. But, her acting, like everything else in this sluggish crime drama written and directed by Norwegian film-maker Anna Gutto, feels implausible; more like tourism than anything in the real world.Binoche plays Sally, a French Canadian we meet on the highway, shooting the breeze over the radio with her friends on the female trucker scene. A film about this community of ballsy women in the male world of trucking, dealing with the seedy truck stops and misogyny, might have gone the distance. Instead the movie shifts to Sally and her brother Dennis (Frank Grillo), who is about to be released from prison.It turns out that Sally is being blackmailed by a crime gang, forced to smuggle drugs in her lorry, or Dennis gets it. Her latest package is human – a 12-year-old girl called Leila (Hala Finley) – and the delivery is across the state lines into the hands of a paedophile ring. When things go seriously wrong at the drop-off Sally and Leila hit the road.Fair play to the script, which delays the inevitable bonding between Sally and Leila until later on. Sally is no bleeding heart; her first thought is to return the girl to the gang. Enter retired FBI agent Gerick (Morgan Freeman), now working as a consultant for the Bureau. He forms a ridiculously cliched double act with Yale-educated suit-and-tie-wearing desk agent Sterling (Cameron Monaghan). The script does almost nothing to build up to the revelation at the end – and the human trafficking angle feels icky. You might want to give it a swerve, Binoche or not. Paradise Highway is available from 17 June on Sky Cinema, and is streaming on Netflix in Australia."
Run Rabbit Run review – Sarah Snook fails to spook,The Succession star is typically excellent but even her performance feels too familiar in this derivative ‘mummy horror’ flick,2,"Motherhood is mayhem. Just ask any woebegone mama of film history: Mia Farrow’s wide-eyed Rosemary Woodhouse, beset with paranoia; Margaret White, the religious zealot of Carrie who mistakes punishment for protection; the bloodthirsty Pamela Voorhees; the abusive Norma Bates.Nowhere, though, is home to more mummy issues than Australia, a country that has hosted some of recent cinema’s stickiest forays into miserable mothers. See: The Babadook’s young widow defending her precocious son against a spindly storybook beast. Or 2020’s Relic, where three generations of women confront their relationships with one another while also confronting some sort of annoying demon disrupting their family reunion. Or, of course, Toni Collette’s longsuffering matriarch in Hereditary, her instantly famous diatribe – “I AM YOUR MOTHER!” – sending shockwaves through every mealy mouthed mama’s boy. If cinema can telegraph national identity, then Australia needs to go to therapy immediately.Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningInto this lineage comes director Daina Reid’s Run Rabbit Run, an Australian mummy horror so indebted to its forebears that it feels derivative by default. The cliches fly thick and fast: a squall of wind in the distance, a barren landscape striated by naked branches, ghoulish dreams awash with eldritch images. And that’s just the first five minutes. Before long, we meet that most crucial of tropes: a mother, Sarah (Sarah Snook), and her creepy daughter Mia (Lily LaTorre).It’s Mia’s seventh birthday, but everything feels grim. Mia’s grandfather has recently died, and mother and daughter are still riding the aftershocks of his death. The sky is pallid, and the house – a chilly place somewhere in the city – easily dwarfs its two inhabitants. Sarah trudges through melancholia to put on a birthday celebration: a quiet affair with her ex-husband, Pete (Damon Herriman), and his new partner, Denise (Naomi Rukavina).A white bunny has somehow entered the house, to Mia’s delight and Sarah’s consternation. It takes to hiding under tables and in eerie corridors: an unwelcome guest whose presence is less adorable than alarming. We return to the rabbit throughout the night, sometimes in spine-tingling closeup, its eyes gleaming devilishly in the blue-dark. Not since Monty Python has a rabbit looked so bloodthirsty; it’s no wonder Sarah tries – and fails – to exile the feral creature when she thinks no one’s watching. “Piss off,” she chides the bunny, who promptly bites her.The bunny becomes one of Run Rabbit Run’s most tantalising elements. Its arrival might be a Lewis Carroll reference, especially given the name of Sarah’s sister – Alice – who went missing as a child. But the film quickly does away with the bunny’s mystery (supernatural, or merely strange?) to focus on Mia’s increasingly hostile demeanour. Something’s been off-kilter since her birthday: she’s suddenly demanding to visit Joan (Greta Scacchi), Sarah’s long-estranged mother whom Mia has never met. Before long, Mia is insisting that she is Alice reincarnate.These are certainly intriguing threads, but they can’t help but feel recycled. Mia’s uncanny, sinister quirks are pulled straight from The Babadook; Sarah’s strained relationship with her ailing mother hews a little too close to Relic, with which this film shares two producers. Snook, of course, is typically excellent, fresh from her turn as Succession’s petulant, scheming Shiv Roy in another spiky role here – but even her performance, as it heightens towards a crazed delirium, recalls Toni Collette’s in Hereditary.Sign up to Saved for LaterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsafter newsletter promotionRun Rabbit Run pulls from each of these entries without ever quite congealing into its own work. At its worst, it replicates the most overplayed tendencies of so-called elevated horror, the subset of the genre which rejects outright thrills and chills in favour of a more subdued, and often duller, gloominess. Screenwriter Hannah Kent – better known for her novels – has a knack for morbid, moody portraits of women in isolated communities, but Run Rabbit Run leans on its atmosphere as a crutch, turning to an abstraction that feels increasingly limp. Something here is weird, we’re told for the fourth, fifth, sixth time.Against all reasonable logic, Sarah returns to her late father’s country house with Mia in tow, where the film continuously hints at a darker current of dread eddying just beneath the surface: patches of blood that mysteriously appear on Mia’s forehead, or a back yard shed full of sharp tools. But these hints never erupt into something greater, and it begins to grow tiresome. Taken together, they play less like a film and more like a moodboard of scares. Motherhood, for all its mayhem, looks a little mundane.Run Rabbit Run is being shown as part of Sydney film festival, on 10 and 15 June. It will premiere on Netflix worldwide on 28 June"
Transformers: Rise of the Beasts review – another thunderous mess,The hapless humans do the best they can to lift this supremely dumb seventh instalment in the alien robot series,2,"It’s the early 1990s. A new subspecies of Transformer – the part-animal, part-robot Maximals – joins forces with Optimus Prime and his Autobots to fight against a ruthless foe, the Terrorcons, who are in the service of Unicron, a planet-munching monster deity. We know all this because every 10 minutes or so, the imbecilic bombast of Transformers: Rise of the Beasts grinds to a halt so that one or more of the characters can explain the story to us.You could argue that any film that requires this much leaden exposition to nail down its plot points really shouldn’t be trusted with heavy machinery. But then, smashing stuff up was always the point of the metal-for-brains Transformers series, the dumbest and noisiest of all the billion-dollar movie franchises. And the latest instalment certainly delivers on needless destruction and world-class stupidity. Plus points include a punchy soundtrack of 90s hip-hop, and Anthony Ramos and Dominique Fishback, heroically holding their own as the hapless humans roped into the Transformers’ thunderous mess."
Flamin’ Hot review – under-seasoned Cheetos biopic sticks to the formula,The man who invented Flamin’ Hot Cheetos gets his time in the sun but Eva Longoria’s by-the-numbers drama leaves questions,2,"A film telling the story of a Mexican American janitor who went on to create a $1bn snack brand fits into Hollywood’s current cultural and creative moment rather perfectly. It’s been a time both of exploring the dramatic origins of everyday products and services (from Nike’s Air Jordans to BlackBerry to Tetris to Uber) and of finding more ways to tell diverse stories outside of a prohibitively limited lens, a lens that’s been particularly limited for Latino characters.Despite Latino audiences over-indexing at cinemas in the US (in 2021, they had the highest per-capita attendance, averaging 1.7 visits a year compared with 1.3 for white audiences), there remains a disappointing dearth of big-screen representation (a report last year showed that just 5.2% of leads in film were Latino or Hispanic). Ahead of this summer’s landmark DC adventure Blue Beetle, centering a rare Latino superhero, Eva Longoria has found an unlikely success story to propel her to the title of film-maker, having cut her teeth on television. Her small-screen tutelage is hard to shake in this earnest and at times efficiently entertaining, yet also rather plodding rags-to-riches tale that aside from the odd flourish, feels very much like a TV movie.It’s hard not to get at least mildly involved though in the story of Richard Montañez, as he grows up as a kid balancing his Mexican-American identity in 60s California while being targeted at school and physically abused at home. Longoria, and the screenwriters Linda Yvette Chávez and Lewis Colick, keep things light even as Montañez (now played by Jesse Garcia) falls into a life of crime with his partner Judy (Annie Gonzalez) by his side. The arrival of a baby forces them to reconsider but an unwelcoming job market, one especially unwelcoming for someone who looks like Richard, makes life a constant struggle. When he gets a job as a janitor at the local Frito-Lay factory, he takes the opportunity with all the enthusiasm he can muster, smiling through various indignities and grateful to be providing for his family.Mopping floors and cleaning equipment isn’t quite enough, though, and when business starts to crumble with a recession-impacted market and a string of layoffs, Richard comes up with an idea, a way to cater to the underserved Latino market, to make the Cheeto … Flamin’ Hot.There’s some obvious mirroring here, the adaptation of a story of someone striving to appeal to a growing yet underappreciated demographic attempting to do the exact same thing, and while the recent trend of business origin stories has been hit and miss to say the least, it’s at least refreshing to see someone who isn’t a straight white man progress within industry (2020’s Madam CJ Walker series Self Made felt similarly vital, if ultimately superior). The film neatly recognises the importance of food as cultural identity and the authenticity that should come with parlaying this into a just business proposition – but while there’s an easy underdog tale here to cheer on, it’s not quite as compelling as the makers seem to believe. Similar to Ben Affleck’s Air (a film that would have worked far better had Viola Davis’s force-of-nature mother been the lead), it all feels a little too minor, a Wikipedia page writ medium.Because even the most magnetic moments (a montage of Montañez and family crafting the perfect chilli sauce, a late-stage grassroots marketing campaign) become dubious with even the lightest bit of research. These films, when done even half-correct, compel one to dig further into the facts, to learn more about the reality of the situation and it doesn’t take long to discover that Flamin’ Hot became the centre of controversy as soon as it was announced. The Los Angeles Times ran an investigation that found that Montañez’s involvement with the creation of the Flamin’ Hot Cheeto has not just been overstated but has been fully fabricated. Since then, a he said, they said back-and-forth has left the situation even foggier (the script was slightly tweaked to recognise the work of a separate team working on a similar project with one of the writers saying “enough” was true for it to work and it shouldn’t be seen as a documentary) and so the facts remain a mystery.One accepts a certain amount of creative license with “true stories” and Montañez’s rise from the bottom to the top is undeniable regardless of his level of involvement with the snack in question, but taken as fact or fiction, the film just isn’t enough of a meal. It’s cheerily done and competently made but broadly sentimental to a fault, the strings being pulled too visible for the film’s many coerced moments of emotion to really work. For a film all about the importance of heat, it’s frankly lukewarm.Flamin’ Hot is now available on Hulu in the US and Disney+ elsewhere"
WoolfWomen: Now or Never review – wild all-female skate team heads for Turkey,"Following an group of terrifying risk-takers doesn’t really tell us much about the sport, or the daredevils themselves",3,"This slight, scrappy documentary follows an all-female crew of downhill skateboarders on a road trip to northern Turkey. To the risk-averse, their sport looks suicidally dangerous, like snowboarding on concrete: riders on longboards cutting down steep roads at speeds up to 140kph, leaving cars for dust. The risk of mangled limbs becomes clear five minutes into the film when skater Jennifer Schauerte hits a patch of gravel, comes off her board and slams into a road barrier. The X-ray of the snapped bone in her leg is the most horrific thing I’ve seen in a cinema so far this year.Three operations later, Schauerte is impatient – maybe even reckless – in her determination to get back on her board. She’s planning a trip to the mountains of north Turkey in her camper with four friends from the skating scene. Together they are the WoolfWomen. (Disappointingly, they are not named in honour of Virginia ­– the extra “o” seems to be a typo that stuck.) It is by no means an essential skateboarding documentary; we don’t learn much about the sport, its history or this group’s place in skateboard culture. Instead, it’s more about chronicling a tribe: cool women travelling wild and free, skinny-dipping in Bulgaria, sitting around the campfire. Schauerte is the star and co-directs with Marchella De Angelis.There are glimpses of a more interesting film at points. Schauerte is clearly a big personality, with charisma and possibly the ego to match. When it’s time to skate in Turkey, the rest of her pack are not convinced she’s recovered sufficiently. “You don’t care about your body, but we do,” says one, exasperatedly. A sharper, more detached film might have focused more on this. In all honesty, much of Woolf Women feels like watching a fly-on-the-wall of someone’s else’s holiday. WoolfWomen: Now or Never is released on 8 June in UK cinemas."
Reality review – palm-sweatingly tense whistleblower drama,"Tina Satter’s verbatim film about the FBI’s interrogation of US intelligence leaker Reality Winner, played by The White Lotus’s Sydney Sweeney, is a stranger-than-fiction reflection of our precarious times",4,"Legal transcripts have long provided rich source material for authentically gripping movies. Last year, the Tribeca festival showcased The Courtroom, a well-received deportation drama featuring “dialogue taken directly from court transcripts”. But it’s not just courtrooms that provide such inspiration. Think back to the “verbatim theatre” of Clio Barnard’s 2010 feature debut The Arbor, in which actors lip-synced recorded interviews about the troubled life of the playwright Andrea Dunbar. In the 2013 TV show Nixon’s the One, Harry Shearer reimagined Tricky Dicky’s secret audio tapes as video recordings, creating an absurdist black comedy from word-for-word Oval Office transcripts. More recently, James Spinney and Peter Middleton’s documentary The Real Charlie Chaplin (2021) added dramatised visuals to archived audio to bring the controversial cinema pioneer’s legend to life.In 2019, playwright Tina Satter used the FBI transcript of an interview with NSA-contracted translator and US Air Force veteran Reality Leigh Winner as the basis of her verbatim play Is This a Room. On 3 June 2017, Winner had been accosted by two FBI agents, Justin C Garrick and R Wallace Taylor, outside her home in Augusta, Georgia. The agents, who recorded the encounter, told Winner they had a warrant to search her home arising from “the possible mishandling of classified information” – a violation of the 1917 Espionage Act. That same act would later be cited in an August 2022 warrant for Mar-a-Lago, the Florida residence of the former president for whom Russian military intelligence (according to a report leaked by Winner) had attempted to secure election victory in 2016. Yet while Teflon Don’s own classified documents scandal is still ongoing, it’s inconceivable that Trump will face anything like the harsh sanctions handed down to Winner in 2018.Satter’s feature film debut, which she has adapted for the screen with co-writer James Paul Dallas, opens with the declaration that “the dialogue in this movie is taken entirely from the transcript of that [FBI] recording”. Sydney Sweeney, who excelled as the stroppy, manipulative Olivia Mossbacher in the first series of HBO’s black comedy White Lotus, is in altogether more vulnerable mode as Winner, who returns home to find Garrick (Josh Hamilton) and Taylor (Marchánt Davis) in her driveway. The agents’ manner is passive-aggressive, all fixed smiles and quietly threatening body language. They stress repeatedly that Winner’s cooperation is “completely voluntary” while also making it clear that she has little agency in the unfolding drama.As for Winner, whose demeanour is a strange blend of amiable and unsettled, her primary concern is her pets: the cat who has hidden under the bed but may run out though an open door on to the road; the dog who will need to be penned before the agents can search the house. When Garrick quietly tells his partner that “she doesn’t know what’s going on”, it’s unclear whether he’s talking about the dog or their suspect.There’s a palm-sweating tension between the veneer of geniality (small talk about rescue animals chewing furniture and groceries going into the refrigerator) and the escalation of the search procedure, ramped up by flash-frame images of the actual raid and surreal Twin Peaks-style visual ellipses during redacted portions of the transcript. When Winner, whose interstitial social media posts paint an unremarkable background picture, admits that the only private place in the house is a “weird” and “creepy” room behind the kitchen (she’s embarrassed because it’s dirty and unused), her descriptive terms seem entirely in keeping with the tenor of their conversation, as if the film was balancing precariously on the cusp of quotidian procedural, black comedy and shrieking horror.Nathan Micay, series composer for BBC/HBO’s Industry, provides a pulsing score that lends a throb of impending disaster to even the most innocuous exchanges, fluttering between Brian Eno-esque ambience and the skin-crawling atonalities of Mica Levi’s sci-fi soundtrack for Under the Skin. At times, the air of awkwardness becomes almost unbearable, the artifice of the dramatic conceit (Pinteresque pauses, coughs and stutters; cinematographer Paul Yee’s unforgiving strip-lit interiors) highlighting the gap between civility and catastrophe, climaxing in Winner’s almost oddly matter-of-fact question: “Am I going to jail tonight?”Bookended by the vile blather of Fox News, in response to which Winner was pushed to act, Reality is a stranger-than-fiction reminder of the precarious times in which we live, and of what happens when individuals challenge authorities less troubled by truth than retribution."
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse review – a dizzying, dazzling sequel","The first Miles Morales animation was a sensation, but this second film, with fresh characters, writers and energy, goes above and beyond",5,"Is it possible to equal a film as boundlessly inventive, stylistically bold and effortlessly cool as Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse? Could a sequel ever match that film’s freshness, energy and visual verve? The answer, it seems, is an emphatic yes. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is sublime. There’s not a frame of this rich, kaleidoscopically detailed animation that isn’t dazzling. It takes the basic themes of the first film – adolescent isolation, communication breakdown, the messy, stressful business of growing, of finding your people – and builds whole worlds with them. It’s a dizzying onslaught of ideas and graphic references. It has heart. It even has a font gag.In the film-making team and in the story there’s a pleasing combination of original talent and fresh blood. Phil Lord and Christopher Miller return as writers and producers, but there’s a new directing team that includes Kemp Powers (Pixar’s Soul). Once again, the story focuses on the bond between fellow Spider-people Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) and Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld). But there is a host of new characters, each with their own distinctive look, including Hobie (Daniel Kaluuya), a spider-punk anarchist, drawn with a graphic style that borrows from Jamie Reid’s Sex Pistols aesthetic and Jamie Hewlett’s Gorillaz.It’s densely plotted, almost overwhelming at times; Daniel Pemberton’s score is an Escher staircase of anxiety. But the soul of the film lies in the tiny human details: like the way Miles, about to gain access to an inner Spider-circle, bounces lightly on his toes – still, at heart, an excited kid waiting for a treat."
"Euphoria review – Cate Blanchett voices a tiger in this visually beautiful takedown of capitalism, but where’s the fury?","Melbourne town hall, Rising festivalJulian Rosefeldt’s magnificent and exhausting film, starring the Oscar winner and Giancarlo Esposito, reverts to evasive surrealist flourishes just as it threatens to become truly angry",3,"There is little to no nature in German artist and film-maker Julian Rosefeldt’s newest work, Euphoria, although there are plenty of animals. Sheep, white stallions, a moose, a camel and finally, voiced seductively by Cate Blanchett, a massive tiger stalking the aisles of an abandoned supermarket. Are they talismans or mute witnesses; mocking us or looking on with horror as we destroy the world?Unlike Godfrey Reggio’s experimental documentary film Koyaanisqatsi, which pitted humanity’s ever increasing growth against the monumental power of nature, Rosefeldt depicts a world already unhinged from the natural, already in its death spiral to oblivion. And where Reggio allowed his images – tied unforgettably to Philip Glass’s pixellated tonal soundscapes – to do the work, Rosefeldt leans heavily, often exhaustingly, on the spoken word.Characters proselytise and lecture, pontificate and philosophise, berate, cajole, expostulate and theorise, all on the subject of money – humankind’s avaricious need for it, its dehumanising effect on communities, the corrupting viral tendency of our financial systems to swallow the world.Cobbled from various sources, from Shakespeare to Warren Buffett, Ayn Rand to Snoop Dogg, the script has the epigrammatic feel of a book of quotes, aphorisms for getting through the death of capitalism. At its best, as with a group of young adults grappling with potentiality and the future of work, it can be bracing and inspired. At its worst, it can be banal and reductive.Sign up to Saved for LaterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsafter newsletter promotionThe piece is at least physically impressive, with a giant screen at one end of the Melbourne town hall where most of the action takes place, and five smaller screens depicting solo drummers at their kits, providing Euphoria’s driving, pulsating beat. Beneath these screens runs the work’s Greek chorus, a choir of young people (the Brooklyn Youth Chorus) lined up like a living skirting board, facing us with hope and sometimes what feels suspiciously like derision. Aurally, it’s magnificent.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningVisually, it’s often beautiful too, without ever quite reaching the heights of euphoria promised by that title. Christoph Krauss’s cinematography is captivating, the intense clarity of the image never at the sacrifice of texture and tone. There are neat little nods to cinematic visionaries from Fellini to Busby Berkeley, and tracking shots for days – although drones have quickly diminished the technical prestige of those admittedly majestic aerial shots. Rosefeldt seems to make a joke of this at one point, as a woman gathers drones around her like birds.There’s a jokiness to much of Euphoria, most notably in a sequence inside a bank where tellers and customers alike wax lyrical on the power of money, its seductiveness and sensuality – before launching themselves into aerial acrobatics and full-blown Broadway choreography. But cutesy dance routines and winking cultural references don’t just undercut the work’s serious intent, something Rosefeldt clearly wants; they also undermine his central argument, something he presumably doesn’t.Euphoria is grappling with a key tension in modern western democracies: how can we stop desiring the thing that will bring about our own destruction, namely endless economic growth in an increasingly automated world? One character, working in a factory that deliberately evokes Amazon, calls for rebellion, and the homeless men who gather around a bin seem to be sniffing at the edges of actual revolution. But Rosefeldt constantly reverts to evasive surrealist flourishes, or painfully obvious visual metaphors, just as his work threatens to become truly angry, truly about something.Elements of the work suggest a quasi-religious, ritualistic purpose – and whenever the music is allowed to swell, we get tantalising hints of it – but Euphoria never quite succumbs to its own impulses. Rosefeldt is influenced by the ancient Greeks, but maybe he should have taken a closer look at Ovid and his retelling of the myth of Phaeton.The son of Helios (the actual sun), Phaeton steals his dad’s chariot and crashes it, obliterating the Earth in the process. Ovid’s account is rapturous with destruction’s power and beauty, an ecstasy in Armageddon Shakespeare would also channel in his “forgeries of jealousy” speech from A Midsummer Night’s Dream. Hubris, overreach, ego and desire, and an earth screaming for it all to stop. It’s the euphoria of end days that Rosefeldt’s fascinating and visually beautiful work can’t quite bring itself to imagine.Euphoria will be shown in Melbourne town hall until 18 June, as part of Rising festival. Free tickets are available on Fridays until allocation exhausted"
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse review – crazily frantic sequel with full-spin energy,"The brilliance of the kaleidoscopic, animated Spider-Verse erupts again in this multidimensional film about a teen superhero with exasperated parents",3,"In 2018, writers Phil Lord and Rodney Rothman gave us a delirious and utterly unexpected new web-spin on the infinite self-replication of Marvel Comics IP and its most reliable hero, Spider-Man. Instead of yet another MCU live action version, directed and produced in that hard, depthless CGI light, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse was a brilliantly inventive animated fantasia about the Spidey mythology, riffing on movies and comic books. The Spider-Verse was a cosmos in which different Spider-folk existed in parallel: a multiverse at least as interesting as that of Dr Strange, and more interesting than the solemn awards-prestige of Everything Everywhere All at Once. Everyone who saw it wondered how this kaleidoscopic new take could be applied elsewhere: James Bond: Across the James-Bond-Verse, or Bilbo Baggins: Beyond the Bilbo-Baggins-Verse.Now we have a sequel subtitled Across the Spider-Verse – could it be that they wanted a certain Beatles track and Apple wouldn’t let them? – with a threequel (Beyond the Spider-Verse) in the pipeline. This second instalment features a plethora of Spideys and the result is as crazily frantic and eyeball-frazzling as ever, but with something exhausting about it now. Its funny jokes – including a gag about the “Spider-Men pointing at each other” meme – and poignant touches get obscured in the endless maelstrom. But there’s no doubting the full-tilt energy, the pure blizzard of narrative data and the twists and turns that it would be unsporting to reveal.Miles Morales (voiced by Shameik Moore) is a Spider-Man whose parents are naturally exasperated by his unreliability; Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld) is a super arachnid in her own universe and, like Miles, has a parent in law enforcement. (This is her dad, although it isn’t immediately clear why her gender-flipped status doesn’t entitle her to a cop mom.) There’s also a Spider-Man India (Karan Soni) and a grown-up Peter Parker (Jake Johnson). Miles is threatened by an enemy connected to his original calamitous spider bite and an existential crisis looms.These Spider-Man movies supercharge and hyperamplify the existing potent teen metaphor of identity in Stan Lee’s great creation. Peter Parker was unable to “come out” as Spider-Man to his parents or his friends; his Spidey-ness was a core part of his bodily being, a superpower and yet a burden, introduced into his bloodstream from that spider bite. Now this secret is upgraded to a cosmic range of possibilities; to be Spider-Man is no longer to be alone, rather, it is to be part of a global range of Spider-people who are different. Viewers have been invited to identify with Spider-Man since the first adaptations of the comic book in the 60s, and are now given a choice of how to identify. It’s dynamic and intriguing, though the detail and the emotion can get lost in the splurge. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is released on 1 June in Australia, and 2 June in the US and UK."
Hypnotic review – preposterous tosh from start to finish starring Ben Affleck,Affleck is in full frowny mode as a haunted cop on the tail of a criminal mastermind in a thriller that seems to revel in its absurdity,2,"Ever wondered what would happen if someone stole a bunch of head-scratching mystery riffs from Now You See Me, The Adjustment Bureau, Memento and The Matrix, stuck them in a blender with an assortment of late-80s straight-to-video neo-noirs, and then pressed go without closing the lid, thereby causing the resultant volcanic eruption to merrily redecorate the world? Well, wonder no more, because here’s co-writer/director Robert Rodriguez with one he prepared earlier – splattering the cinema screen with all the colours of the daft, courtesy of an A-list star, a B-movie aesthetic, a C-minus musical score, and a D/E audience rating (Hypnotic has already failed to mesmerise in the US). Rejoice, fans of big-screen trash, as Oscar-winner Ben Affleck invites you to join him on a journey that will test your head, and your mind, and your brain…Affleck is in maximum frowny mode as Daniel Rourke, a detective haunted by memories of his young daughter’s abduction. The culprit pleaded “not guilty due to mental incapacity” after claiming to have no memory of the kidnapping, or of the child’s whereabouts. It sounds like a ruse, until Rourke finds himself playing cat-and-mouse with a criminal mastermind (William Fichtner) blessed with unholy powers of persuasion. “Are you familiar with the concept of hypnotic constructs?” asks Diana Cruz (Alice Braga), a “dime-store psychic” who delivers Basil Exposition-style speeches about “hypnotics” – people with “the ability to actually influence the brain over a psychic bandwidth. Telepaths just read the mind; hypnotics reshape its reality.”Much of this dialogue, including the immortal line “He erased his own mind?!”, is at once overripe yet still oddly soft-boiled. As for the mise-en-scène, the early movements are all baked exteriors and strip-club-lighting interiors, with heavily coded reds, blues and greens. Later, when the big reveal happens, everything goes white, signalling that a light has been shone on all these mysteries – although it all continues to make no sense.Rodriguez and co-scripter Max Borenstein, who wrote the 2014 Godzilla reboot and created the Minority Report TV series, go on a thematic shoplifting spree, snatching psychic pushes from Stephen King’s Firestarter, dozy psycho-crime plot twists from Primal Fear, and Philip K Dick false memories from Blade Runner, Total Recall et al. At times I was reminded of the 2015 thriller Solace, in which Anthony Hopkins helped the FBI by functioning as a sort of psychic satnav. Somehow, this is even sillier.One minute Rodriguez is churning out sub-Inception world-bending hallucination scenes, the next he’s nodding his head toward Hitchcock as someone creeps towards a shower room brandishing a large pair of scissors (Herrmannesque strings ahoy!). Affleck does a lot of eyes-closed, big-face acting to indicate just how conflicted his character feels, while Braga does an impressive job of not laughing while delivering lines such as “Pain can keep the mind awake”, or “He was already dead; I set him free”.Sunglasses are worn indoors, scenery is chewed through sucked teeth (hats off to a scene-stealing Jackie Earle Haley for adding a fleeting note of uncharacteristic understatement) and a chase scene climaxes with a white van banging into a golf cart as everything implodes in a sub-Truman Show mess. Meanwhile composer Rebel Rodriguez leads the audience by the hand, with tinkly keyboard cues telling us when things are supposed to be sad, thumpy bash-bash noises pumping up the action scenes, and big quasi-Zimmer honks reminding us that his dad is essentially doing Christopher Nolan on the cheap.While the result may be preposterous tosh from start to finish (a nippy 94 minutes – hooray!), there’s fun to be had in scenes of a man attempting to pull his own hand off while under the influence, and in gunfights that turn into staring competitions and then end with everyone simply shooting themselves in the foot. Since Rodriguez’s back catalogue contains such knowing pulp as the vampire actioner From Dusk Till Dawn and the grindhouse pastiche Planet Terror, one presumes that he knows exactly how ridiculous this all is, and has his tongue planted firmly in his cheek throughout. Or maybe not. The fact that I’m not entirely sure simply adds to the guilty pleasure."
Paradise review – visually striking account of Siberian wildfires leans towards abstraction,"Alexander Abaturov’s stunning film captures the resilience of villagers in remote Shologon, but feels contextless",3,"Due to a combination of climate change and state neglect, giant wildfires raged through millions of hectares of land in northeastern Siberia in the summer of 2021. Classified as “control zones” by the Russian government, the region gets little aid from officials; the cost of combating fires is considered to be excessive compared to the damage done. Focusing on the rural village of Shologon, Alexander Abaturov’s evocative documentary chronicles the heroic efforts of the indigenous community to protect their homes.Largely populated by elderly people, women and children, Shologon has little equipment to slow the deadly spread of “the Dragon”, the locals’ nickname for the powerful forest fires. What they possess in spades, however, is astonishing resilience and camaraderie in the face of unprecedented calamity. Images of the villagers swathed in clouds of black smoke are accompanied by a child’s reading of an ancient folk tale, which speaks of a mighty and toxic wind – a profound juxtaposition that connotes how their fight for survival has existed for generations.Languidly oscillating between a wintry snow-white landscape, the orange hue of the fires and the blue of the villagers’ traditional clothing, the astonishing cinematography (by Paul Guilhaume) evokes the hand-tinted, expressionistic visuals of nature documentaries from the silent era. Visually gorgeous as it is, the film’s deliberately laconic style occasionally runs the risk of reducing a pressing issue into abstraction. Considering how remote Shologon is, more contextual information on the area’s society and politics would have made Paradise an even more substantial work of nonfiction. Paradise is released on 26 May at Bertha DocHouse, London."
Boonie Bears: Guardian Code review – adorable bears in smash-hit Chinese eco tale,"With its two ursine characters, this formulaic kids’ tale tells its environmentally conscious story with plenty of warmth but few surprises",3,"The ninth feature in a hugely popular Chinese animated series directed by Lin Yongchang and Shao Heqi, Boonie Bears: Guardian Code is also the franchise’s highest-grossing film, second behind The Wandering Earth 2 as the biggest Chinese film of 2023 so far. With its two main characters Bramble and Briar, adorable bears who were abandoned by their mother in a forest fire, this environmentally conscious adventure is an entertaining, if rather formulaic, ride.For lovers of cute animals, the CGI designs of the brothers are quite lovely and detailed, though not exactly distinctive. Goofy and optimistic Bramble believes that their mother is out there searching for them, but Briar holds no such hope. However, a chance encounter with Charlotte, an aspiring scientist, promises a new clue that would lead the pair to their long-lost mummy. What follows is an extravaganza of good versus evil, bears versus bots.There’s a curious paradox here: while Boonie Bears: Guardian Code’s plot points are absolutely generic, their execution remains rather well done. Fashioned with metallic tentacles for arms, the menacing and gigantic robot used by the villain looks suspiciously similar to the killing droid that terrorises Pixar’s The Incredibles, while a number of twists seem borrowed from older classics. Still, the animation is lively enough that these face-off sequences can still deliver a dose of thrills.In the English-language dub, some of the voice talents are occasionally wooden, but the film compensates for this lack with a nice central song. Boonie Bears: Guardian Code is not going to blow the minds of the adults – or the more discerning little ones – but this can make for a fun, though possibly not very memorable, cinema outing. Boonie Bears: Guardian Code is released on 26 May in UK and Irish cinemas."
The Little Mermaid review – bland but good-natured Disney remake,"It doesn’t have the magic of the original, but Halle Bailey gives a winning performance, backed by a strong supporting cast ",3,"News that Disney’s live-action(ish) remake of its 1989 animated hit The Little Mermaid would star African American musician and actor Halle Bailey provoked the racist #NotMyAriel hashtag, with Fox News-fed “replacement theory” wingnuts philosophically frottering themselves into a frenzy of fear and loathing.Yet now that the film is finally upon us, it’s hard to imagine how something so utterly innocuous – not to say bland – could have caused such upset. OK, so this doesn’t have the timeless cartoon magic of the original (be honest, what “live-action” Disney remake does?), and the two-and-a-quarter hour running time is stretching a point. It’s functionally good-natured rehash fare, bogged down by some watery CG and a few uncomfortable dips into “uncanny valley”, yet buoyed up by Bailey’s winning titular performance.Director Rob Marshall reunites with Mary Poppins Returns screenwriter David Magee, while musicals man-of-the-moment Lin-Manuel Miranda serves as co-producer and songwriter alongside the original film’s composer, Alan Menken. Daveed Diggs and Awkwafina inject a little comic oomph into their weirdly photorealist characters (a crab and a bird respectively), Javier Bardem oozes parental protectiveness as King Triton, and Melissa McCarthy channels the drag-queen spirit of Divine as the Sea Witch Ursula, centrepiece of an impressively spectacular FX finale."
Kidnapped review – Marco Bellocchio’s antisemitism drama is a classic in the making,"Based on the true story of a young Jewish boy kidnapped by papal authorities, this is a full-tilt melodrama that lays bare tyranny, bigotry and the abuse of power in the Catholic church",5,"Cannes is this year becoming a counterblast to ageism. Italian director Marco Bellocchio, at the age of 83 – and almost 60 years after he first came to prominence with his 1965 movie Fists in the Pocket – has created a gripping, heartbreaking true-political crime story from the pages of history. It is a full-tilt melodrama with the passionate vehemence of Victor Hugo or Charles Dickens, which lays bare an ugly formative episode of Europe’s Catholic church: an affair of antisemitism and child abuse.It is based on the true story of Edgardo Mortara, a young Jewish child in Bologna who, in 1858, when he was six, was taken away from his family by the papal authorities. This was done because Edgardo’s doting Catholic nursemaid had claimed that when Edgardo was a baby, and apparently in dire sickness, she had presumed to carry out an emergency baptism, because she feared Edgardo would die and go to limbo. The fanatical Inquisition authorities affected to believe that the Jewish family would therefore “sacrifice” the now-Catholic child, and jumped at the chance to punish the Jewish community and inflate their own missionary self-importance. Edgardo, extensively brainwashed, grew up to be a priest and vehement partisan of the church.Enea Sala and Leonardo Maltese play Edgardo as a child and then an adult, and Fausto Russi Alesi and Barbara Ronchi play the boy’s stricken, desperate parents. Fabrizio Gifuni is the ice-cold Bologna inquisitor Father Feletti, and Paolo Pierobon is Pope Pius IX who makes Edgardo his pet and turns the case into a trial of strength between the church and anti-papal nationalists, foreign journalists and of course the Jews, expressing his antisemitism partly though his paranoid distaste for his Rothschild creditor.Bellocchio shows us a brutal convulsion of tyranny, power and bigotry with echoes of the Dreyfus affair in France, and later, horrific events. When the chilling Feletti finally tells a judge that in taking the Jewish child he was merely executing a command from the Vatican, that is a familiar courtroom defence. The kidnapping of young Edgardo is a round-up in miniature, and the pope’s heartlessness a forerunner of Pius XII’s apparent wartime indifference to Nazi atrocities.I thrilled to this movie: the moment when the pope playfully hides Edgardo in his cloak while he plays hide-and-seek is an extraordinary parallel to when he first hid in his mother’s skirts. My heart was in my mouth when Edgardo is carried off by the brutal authorities. And at the end, when the older, agonised Edgardo comes to see his mother on her deathbed, Bellocchio creates a denouement that made me gasp. This already looks like a classic. Kidnapped screened at the Cannes film festival"
Asteroid City review – Wes Anderson’s 1950s sci-fi is an exhilarating triumph of pure style,"This tale of earth-shattering events in a space-obsessed desert town leans nicely into its own artificiality, and every delicious, microscopic detail is a delight",4,"To say that he’s done it again – yet again – is going to mean something different to fans and non-fans. But I have to say the first category is the only place to be for what is simply a terrifically entertaining and lightly sophisticated new comedy from Wes Anderson, in his signature rectilinear, deadpan style, with primary-pastel colours and his all-star repertory ensemble cast. Regulars including Jason Schwartzman and Tilda Swinton are now joined by Scarlett Johansson and Tom Hanks, who have been welcomed into the droll Anderson fold. And the director emphatically proves that the YouTube pasticheurs are like Butlin’s Elvis impersonators: they’re not quite doing it.Asteroid City’s eccentricity, its elegance, its gaiety, and its sheer profusion of detail within the tableau frame make it such a pleasure. So, too, does its dapper styling of classic American pop culture. With every new shot, your eyes dart around the screen, grabbing at all the painterly little jokes and embellishments, each getting a micro-laugh.It is set sometime in the mid-1950s in a US desert town called Asteroid City, named so because 3,000 years ago this was the site of a meteorite landing (“asteroid” is not in fact quite accurate, as a meteorite is part of an asteroid). It is now the location for a US government observatory, but it is also where an annual convention takes place honouring the teen inventors of the best high-school science projects; these are of course hilariously scary and advanced, such as a fully functioning death ray. Amusingly, the town has a sign welcoming the nation’s “junior stargazers and space cadets”, playfully inviting you to assume that the phrase “space cadet” really did once exist in this non-abusive form. (It didn’t.)Just as the kids and their parents assemble for the proceedings in the hot, dry desert with its fierce, blue sky and yellowish terrain, a staggering event happens – which is to say, more staggering than the periodic atom bomb tests whose mushroom clouds appear on the horizon. The president decrees that that no one is allowed in or out of town, a strict lockdown will be enforced until the danger is deemed to have passed and these people will just have to live together for a little. Schwartzman plays a widowed war photographer who gets his cranky, grieving father-in-law (Hanks) to come and help look after the kids; he falls for a nearby inventor-kid mom, a movie star played by Johansson. Jeffrey Wright plays the general in charge, Steve Carell is the motel owner, Matt Dillon the town’s mechanic, Rupert Friend is the local singing cowpoke. Hope Davis and Liev Schreiber are among the parents, and everyone is delivering the lines with absolute seriousness.But there is also a framing device that actually acknowledges the artificiality and two-dimensionality of Anderson’s familiar mise-en-scène, and the invisible proscenium arch within which his dramas appear to be happening. What we are seeing is supposed to be a stage play, though miraculously brought into an approximation of the real world, written by an emotionally fragile dramatist (Edward Norton) who is in a relationship with one of the cast. You can imagine the distant mountains and sandy ground as a stage set, although they might not necessarily be CGI illusions; Asteroid City was shot on location in Spain.As ever, there is little or no emotional content, despite the ostensible subject of grief. The movie rattles cleverly and exhilaratingly along, adroitly absorbing the implications of pathos and loneliness without allowing itself to slow down. It is tempting to consider this savant blankness as some kind of symptom, but I really don’t think so: it is the expression of style. And what style it is. Asteroid City screened at the Cannes film festival and is released on 23 June in UK and Irish cinemas."
Tokyo Stories review – artistic immersion into the city’s creative life,The Exhibition on Screen documentary series delves into the boundless  energy of the Japanese megalopolis,3,"Having achieved impressive box office results with its Vermeer film, the Exhibition on Screen strand makes bit of a detour from its comfort zone with its latest film: an overview of artistic takes on Japan’s megalopolis and capital city, ranging from Edo-era paintings to street performance events. Having established itself by largely focusing on the golden eras of art history, dominated by the big names of the Renaissance and the late 19th century, here the net is spread to include contemporary artists who will be (mostly) not especially familiar to non-devotees. And while the conduit for the film is the Tokyo: Art & Photography exhibition staged by Oxford’s Ashmolean museum in 2021, this is far from a standard gallery tour: the approach is near-total immersion in Tokyo itself, along with a series of interviews with a string of practitioners including “girly photographer” Mika Ninagawa, veteran pop-era painter Keiichi Tanaami, and representatives of a wacky collective called Chim-Pom.The results are as handsome as ever, with the film dominated by spectacular photography of Tokyo’s urban landscape in all its glory. For rather obvious reasons, not much of the city survives from before the second world war, but there are traces of ancient Japan to be seen, and accounts – through 17th-century depictions of the marshy, sparsely populated locale – of the embryonic Edo before it became the fortress of the Tokugawa shogunate. These days we are of course much more familiar with the Blade Runner-esque city of glowing neon and retrofitted chaos, but Tokyo as shown here seems to have moved on again, with plenty of pristine new-builds and fancy monuments.How much you respond to this film will, no doubt, depend on your response to the artists involved; they all come across as approachable, enthusiastic and articulate. You can see, though, that this is a riskier film for Exhibition on Screen than, say, Leonardo: The Works or Van Gogh’s Sunflowers – or even those on more shadowy figures such as Mary Cassatt or Edward Hopper. Even so, there’s a lot to hold the interest here, with the overarching sense of a city of boundless creative energy. Tokyo Stories is released on 23 May in UK and Irish cinemas."
A Crack in the Mountain review – scrupulous look at the exploitation of a natural wonder,"Alastair Evans’s documentary details the struggle to preserve Hang Son Doong caves in Vietnam, which were discovered in 1991",3,"“There was quite a substantial breeze coming out. A substantial breeze normally would signify a substantial cave.” A nice piece of Brit understatement about what is a late-breaking entry for a wonder of the world: Vietnam’s Hang Son Doong, the largest cave system on the planet by volume, stumbled upon by jungle logger Ho Khảnh in 1991 and only surveyed in 2009. The stupefying shots here of towering limestone buttes, skylight dolines and sodden subterranean rainforest look computer-generated, like something from Avatar.Another visitor points out that where other caves echo each other, Hang Son Doong feels like nothing else on Earth. Predictably, this exceptionalism has dollar signs spinning in the eyes of the Vietnamese government and big business, who are sizing up the grotto for a cable car transit system. Alastair Evans’s slightly ungainly documentary (we only get the history of the cave’s discovery 20 minutes from the end) very thoroughly details the campaign to preserve Hang Son Doong in its natural state in the context of Vietnam’s breakneck economic boom in the period since it was discovered.There’s a noticeable colonial gulf in the gap between tourists, researchers enjoying the cave and the local porters – which Evans, devoting a section to the latter, is evidently aware of. But a second kind of colonialism isn’t so easily dismissed: that of ecologically minded westerners and urban Vietnamese telling rural people who have only just emerged from penury to go easy on the development. Quảng Bình province, where Hang Son Doong is situated, was Vietnam’s poorest, levelled by American bombing and barely redeveloped until the 1990s.Campaigners – often targets for violent repression by the government – are pinning their hopes on the so-far responsible urbanisation of Phong Nha, the hub for visits to Hang Son Doong. But more than one person in this scrupulous but depressing film concludes that high-density planning and mass tourism in the region are inevitable, the flows of capital as mighty and unstoppable as the water that gouged out the cave. The sublime views feel a bit consolatory after that. A Crack in the Mountain is released in cinemas on 26 May."
May December review – fraught drama starring Natalie Portman and Julianne Moore promises more than it delivers,Todd Haynes’ tale of merging identities is too knowing and too glossy to drive its message home,3,"Natalie Portman and Julianne Moore play actor and subject in May December, the enjoyable tale of a fraught creative collaboration that finally promises more than it delivers. Director Todd Haynes adores playing with the pieces of traditional Hollywood cinema, like a kid with a train set, or his mum’s makeup box, to the point where the artifice becomes the main thrust of his story. If May December is guilty of making hysterical mountains out of molehills, then, this is partly the point. That’s Hollywood movies for you. They turn every crisis into a pre-packaged drama.Moore co-stars as Gracie Atherton, a 60-year-old southern belle with a sun-bright smile and a brittle coating of frost. More than two decades ago she fell in love with Joe Yoo, a 13-year-old schoolboy, sparking a nationwide scandal that people remember to this day. Portman is Elizabeth, the actor set to play Gracie in the big-budget film of her life. “You look taller on television, but we’re basically the same size,” Gracie marvels, welcoming the star to her seafront Georgia home. Elizabeth agrees: “We’re basically the same.”Naturally Elizabeth’s job is impersonating other people, but you soon start to wonder if she’s going too method this time. Gracie is now (seemingly happily) married to Joe (Charles Melton), who has grown up to become a handsome, round-shouldered 30-something family man. Elizabeth duly sits Joe down for an interview, but she appears to be channelling the younger version of Gracie. Back in the day, we are told, the lovers were exposed when they were caught in-flagrante in the back of a pet shop – of all the undignified places to be found. Elizabeth visits the spot and prostrates herself in the doorway, simulating sex with a ghost in the name of research.Haynes’s film – which competes for the Cannes Palme d’Or – sets itself up as a tense chamber piece, a study of merging identities and shifting power dynamics in the manner of Joseph Losey’s The Servant or Ingmar Bergman’s Persona. But May December also comes coloured by the lurid downlight of tabloid culture. It could be a pastiche of a psychological thriller, or a playfully misdirected daytime afternoon soap. Much of the action, for instance, is accompanied by a crashing four-note piano refrain that surely signals imminent disaster were it not for the fact that it’s deployed at the most ostensibly humdrum moments. It lands like a bomb as Elizabeth crosses the street to the community centre. It explodes once again when Gracie pulls open the door to her fridge. “I don’t think we have any hot dogs,” she says.Inevitably Elizabeth’s research trip stirs up buried resentments, past traumas. It’s possible that Gracie and Joe have spun a self-serving story of their life together – and told it louder and louder so as to drown out the chorus of disapprovaling voices outside. But even self-actualisation has limits. These two could have been creating a fiction all along.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotionWhen shooting her film roles, Elizabeth prefers lots of takes. She insists each take carries her that bit closer to the truth. The evidence, though, suggests the majority of movies are themselves like hot dogs: processed, synthetic and garnished with tasty sauce. Haynes’s drama, to its credit, is aware of the issue and shows its repercussions – the way it reduces the performers and the people they portray – but it’s too knowing and glossy to drive this message home. Elizabeth’s ridiculous film-within-a-film is surely bound to miss its mark. For all its relish and abandon, I fear that May December does too."
Killers of the Flower Moon review – Scorsese’s remarkable epic about the bloody birth of modern America,"Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro and Lily Gladstone star in this macabre western about serial murders among the Osage tribe in 1920s Oklahoma, which reflects the erasure of Native Americans from the US",5,"Martin Scorsese’s western true-crime thriller is about the US’s Osage murders of the early 1920s, based on the nonfiction bestseller by David Grann. With co-writer Eric Roth, Scorsese crafts an epic of creeping, existential horror about the birth of the American century, a macabre tale of quasi-genocidal serial killings which mimic the larger erasure of Native Americans from the US. It places in the drama’s foreground a gaslit marriage of lies and poisoned love. It echoes Scorsese’s earlier work about mob violence, mob loyalty and the final, inevitable sellout to the federal authorities, whose own bad faith gradually emerges. But in the end, this film is about what all westerns are about, and perhaps all history: the brutal grab for land, resources and power.Lily Gladstone gives a performance of tragic force as Mollie Burkhart, a Native American woman from the Osage tribe who, like all her people, has become unexpectedly wealthy because the apparently stony and unpromising land in Oklahoma on which the authorities allowed the Osage to settle turned out to have huge reserves of oil. But they are still subject to a racist and infantilising condition of “guardianship”: to claim the income and spend it, Osage individuals need a white co-signatory. And there is something else: Mollie and her family are deeply disturbed by mysterious illnesses which have been killing off Osage people, one by one. Later the bodies of Osage murder-victims are found, including Mollie’s wayward sister Anna (Cara Jade Myers), whose autopsy is bizarrely carried out in the open air, at the crime scene itself.Into this situation arrives a slippery, venal individual called Ernest, played by Leonardo DiCaprio; an ambitious but also submissive and fundamentally inadequate man: greedy, stupid and biddable. He has returned to the US after service in the first world war, and comes to the vast estate of his wealthy uncle, who has offered him a job working alongside his hardfaced brother Byron, played by Scott Shepherd, who has clearly been extensively normalised in the violence and corruption over which the uncle presides.This cattleman-plutocrat is William Hale, played by Robert De Niro, a man of calcified resentment and self-importance who preens himself on his good relations with the Osage people. Hale hires Ernest for a position as his vague underling, courtier and dirty-work factotum, and encourages him to date and also marry Mollie, whom Ernest has already met, which would give him (and therefore Hale) a legal claim on Mollie’s “headrights”, as her oil entitlements are known. And so Ernest and Mollie’s doomed marriage commences, complicated by the terrible fears of Mollie’s ailing mother, Lizzie Q (Tantoo Cardinal), who has a quietly beautiful death scene. Mollie’s diabetes is also a factor; it is made strangely worse by the medicine Hale has procured for her, and which Ernest administers while always simpering and blubbing his concern for her declining health.When the situation becomes too bad for the federal authorities to ignore, Washington DC sends an officer of its fledgling Bureau of Investigations (later to be the FBI). This is Tom White, played by Jesse Plemons. But Scorsese shows us the politics: the bureau’s belated appearance appears to be, at least partly, a matter of containing the difficult situation involving the white people and the inescapably wealthy Osage peoples, and reinforcing federal control over the new state of Oklahoma.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotionAs performed by Gladstone and DiCaprio, the relationship between Mollie and Ernest has a kind of spiritual nausea; Ernest is sincere about his feelings for his wife, in his way, but they are part of a context of bad faith and violence. His real relationship is of course with his uncle, he is the beta to the older man’s alpha. Weirdly, DiCaprio starts to look like DeNiro, like a dog resembling its master: a younger, victim-villain version with the same gimlet-eyed fear and hostility and the same rat-trap mouth with the corners turned down. His uncle has inducted him into the Masons, and it is into the local masonic hall, with all its regalia, that Hale leads the wretched Ernest for a corporal punishment scene when the young man lets him down – the most extraordinary corporal punishment I have seen since Lindsay Anderson’s If….Hale’s rule, so avowedly caring and sensitive to the Osage, is in fact creating a vast dysfunction of depression, alcoholism, lawlessness, fatal illness and murder. Gladstone creates a persona for Mollie that is flawed and self-reproachful, with some shame at having collaborated with her persecutor. She has dignity and calm and rises above the squalor all around her, but that calm is also the stricken immobility of illness. And she knows that Ernest was never any good but she was charmed and seduced by him all the same.Scorsese presents a remarkable story, with an audacious framing device of a briskly insensitive “true crime” radio show featuring Osage characters crassly played by white actors. This is an utterly absorbing film, a story that Scorsese sees as a secret history of American power, a hidden violence epidemic polluting the water table of humanity. Killers of the Flower Moon screened at the Cannes film festival, and is released on 20 October in cinemas."
Four Daughters review – fact and fiction mix in mother’s heartbreak over Islamic State,"Actors and real people re-enact the past to understand why two daughters left Tunisia to fight for IS in Syria, leaving the rest of the family behind",3,"There is real emotional warmth and human sympathy in this otherwise somewhat flawed film, a docudrama experiment in getting actors to play some of the real people in a tragic news story from Tunisia. Olfa Hamrouni, a divorced woman from the coastal town of Sousse, made the headlines seven years ago when two of her four daughters, Rahma and Ghofrane, broke her and their sisters’ hearts by vanishing from the country to become fighters and wives for Islamic State in Syria. Now director Kaouther Ben Hania re-enacts key parts of Olfa’s family life, featuring the remaining sisters Eya and Tayssir playing themselves, but performers playing the vanished fugitives: Ichraq Matar is Ghofrane and Nour Karoui is Rahma.Despite the fact that she hasn’t vanished, and is in fact a vivid and formidable onscreen figure, Olfa is also played by an actor, Hend Sabri, so the procedure is already in fact slightly muddled, though no less intriguing. The performers and real figures are interviewed together, and then scenes are played out, with Olfa coming on to say where they’re going wrong. The actor Majd Mastoura plays Olfa’s distant and abusive father, and the film shows how weirdly upset he becomes to embody a vicious character from the real world.Ben Hania seems to have embarked on this process with an open mind, having no clear idea what light this approach would shed on the case. In fact, I’m not sure how much light is shed on it, and in fact this technique might even be entirely wrong for finding out how and when exactly the two young women became radicalised. Imagining what was going on inside their heads using actorly intuition might not get us very far. In fact, a TV discussion panel clip showing Olfa furiously denouncing the politicians, and saying that their tolerance of jihadist imams after the Arab Spring was what turned her daughters, is a rather shrewd insight of the sort that docudrama does not yield.However, these women have such a presence on screen that their sympathy drives the movie. There is something mysteriously moving about the real Eya and Tayssir being introduced to the actresses playing their sisters, and being awestruck and moved by how similar they are – and how strange it is to feel the four-way dynamic of their sisterly relationship being restored in this semi-fictionalised form. Four Daughters screened at the Cannes film festival and is in UK and Irish cinemas from 1 March."
About Dry Grasses review – Nuri Bilge Ceylan’s absorbing drama of a teacher-pupil crisis,"The latest film from the Turkish film-maker is a studied, Chekhovian film about a schoolteacher accused of abuse by a female student",4,"Turkish auteur Nuri Bilge Ceylan has delivered another of his expansive, ruminative and distinctly Chekhovian character-driven dramas. Again it is spread out across the landscape of Anatolia, and again there is Ceylan’s emphasis on still photography and portraiture. This film does however have one very atypical touch: a very startling and Brechtian meta-moment when we are reminded this is a film we’re watching, and the tiny and flickeringly firelit interiors are created on a soundstage.It certainly does however have a very typical title: that is, forbidding and slightly disconcerting. In About Dry Grasses’s final section, its lead character is to ponder the fact that the gauntly beautiful terrain of Anatolia seems to have only two seasons. The first is the snow-covered winter in which we get Ceylan’s signature shot of a lonely figure plodding towards the camera in the snow. This suddenly gives way to bright summer, ahe ground will reveal itself to be covered in a featureless dry grass, which has a mysterious fascination in its austere beauty.On the face of it, the film is (yet another) school drama about a teacher whose career is imperilled by a sexual abuse charge from a pupil. Samet (Deniz Celiloglu) is a balding teacher at a state school in the remote region who is very candidly bored with everything – or almost everything – and longs for a posting to Istanbul. He is a teacher who prides himself, a bit smugly, on how friendly and approachable he is with the pupils, but is capable of bad-tempered outbursts in which Ceilioglu is very convincing. He shares lodgings with a fellow teacher, the younger and more personable Kenan (Musab Ekici).Samet has a favourite pupil: Sevim (Ece Bagci) a 14-year-old with whom he has flirtatious banter and sometimes puts his arm round. When a heart-bedecked love letter addressed to Samet is found in Sevim’s exercise book by a member of staff, Sevim is humiliated and tearful and Samet is coldly embarrassed: his warm affection to her is replaced by a wary sense that this is going to get him into trouble.And so it proves. Sevim comes to his office, the scene of so many inappropriate chats in the past and begs Samet to give the letter back to her; she instantly senses that his patronising claim to have destroyed it is a lie. In that moment, all her feelings for her teacher are transformed into rage, and this is to result in an abuse claim levelled against both Samet and Kenan. The insecure and prickly Samet suspects that it is the more attractive Kenan who is the prime object of these allegations (left unspecified by the school authorities), and this preposterous competitive streak has implications for his budding relationship with Nuray (Merve Dizdar), a woman who appears to prefer Kenan.Life goes on in this place; the investigation into Samet goes on, his tricky and duplicitious friendship with Kenan goes on and so does his chatty, sarky friendship with other people in the village. It all continues without reaching any very sensational endpoint, yet without feeling anticlimactic either. This film, so apparently forbidding and opaque the way many Ceylan films initially are, has in fact something engrossing in its garrulous and wide-ranging quality: a literary quality in fact. Ceylan endows Samet with the qualities of a wryly observant narrator, disillusioned and unsatisfied and yet generous enough in his way.This is another very absorbing movie from this unique director — a Cannes Palme winner for his film Winter Sleep — who thoroughly deserves his continuing A-list status."
Anselm review – Wim Wenders’ reverent 3D portrait of artist Anselm Kiefer,The director’s serious examination of the German artist’s life and work has an architectural quality as it moves around some monumental art – and studios,4,"Wim Wenders brings a certain awe, or even shock, or even a kind of reverently docu-dramatised PTSD to his film about the German artist Anselm Kiefer. The creator of paintings, photographs, colossal installations and illustrated book artefacts is celebrated but in some quarters criticised for his engagement with German fascism and the Holocaust, mediated through his lifelong love for the poetry of Paul Celan. The film shows us his work in all its giganticism, with minimal archival interview material, though there are some fancifully conceived but successfully executed fantasy scenes of the artist in boyhood and young adulthood. The title perhaps intends the use of his first name not in any relaxed way, but in a style comparable to Leonardo or Michelangelo.This is a film which Wenders presents in 3D, just as he did with his study of Pina Bausch in 2011 – the effect of the three dimensions there was to accentuate the physicality of the dancers. Here it has a more architectural effect, especially when we are in Kiefer’s studio areas, such as his huge 40-hectare atelier site La Ribaute in Barjac, near Nîmes in the south of France, which, with all its huge exhibition spaces and sculpture gardens is virtually this creator’s own city state. The 3D delineates the vast forms and monumental structures that loom up and out of the screen: we are immersed in this place in the way visitors would be, maybe even more so, as the camera is mounted on drones and platforms, and the film always encourages you go into cathedral-rubbernecker mode.There is fascination – and trepidation – in watching the master at work, strolling or cycling around his vast warehouse, with creations piled or stacked in every corner. Does he employ assistants? The film doesn’t really show any, but there are some people doing the humbler tasks of helping him with the machinery he needs, especially when he is creating vast moodscape canvases in which the materials are charred and burned. This is a film of great seriousness and severity, although there are laughs of a gobsmacked nature to be had when you see Kiefer with an actual flamethrower, incinerating the straw-matted surface of a painting, to get that texture of devastation, though he is accompanied by someone whose job it is to spray water on the surface immediately afterwards to make sure things don’t get out of control. Kiefer appears in this film to be a dedicated cigar smoker: fortunately, he doesn’t have one lit while he’s doing this, but the insurance bills must be sky-high.Kiefer’s angry, passionate, haunted images are driven, of course, by Germany’s dark past, and Wenders’s film persuasively suggests that it is in the ruins of 1945, the year of the artist’s birth, that the seed of inspiration is to be found. The unforgettable images of shattered Berlin give us the dark uproar from which Kiefer’s work is thrown out. In a confrontationally transgressive and satirical spirit, Kiefer created work derived from fascist or Nazi iconology, or the 19th-century German mythic tropes that the Nazis manipulated. But Wenders’s film gives some space to Kiefer’s detractors, who suggest that he is riding an updraft of demonic inspiration and his work is having its anti-fascist cake and eating it. Kiefer himself is shown in old footage repudiating these suggestions although the issue is not raised in the present tense. It is possible still to be agnostic about the macho grandeur of Kiefer’s work and the “headless women” ball dresses that occupy the film’s opening section. Yet this is a superbly controlled and expressed film and its high seriousness about the nature and purpose of art really is invigorating. Anselm screened at the Cannes film festival; it is released on 8 December in UK cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema."
Limbo review – Simon Baker is transcendent in another beautiful film from Ivan Sen,"The cast are uniformly excellent in the auteur’s latest outback noir, with his star playing a tough, sorrowful detective investigating the murder of an Indigenous girl 20 years before",4,"After making last year’s Loveland, a heavily ponderous and unsubtle sci-fi film set in Hong Kong, the Indigenous auteur Ivan Sen – most famous for directing the Mystery Road movies – has returned to crime in the sun-scorched desert. And damn it’s great to have him back doing outback noir, because Sen is so bloody good at it. His latest work, Limbo, is an eerily meditative production with top-notch performances and a harshly beautiful monochrome veneer.Simon Baker leads the cast as Travis Hurley, a tough, sorrowful, heroin-injecting detective with a buzzcut and a downbeat, Walter White-ish demeanour. At one point a child accurately observes that he looks more like a drug dealer than a member of the force.The film is set in the titular – fictitious – opal mining town, where Hurley arrives to ask questions about the unsolved murder case of an Indigenous girl, Charlotte Hayes, 20 years before.The addled cop is a bit of a trope: they may wrestle with the demon drink (like Aaron Pedersen in Goldstone), be afflicted by physical ailments (Brendan Cowell’s tinnitus-suffering constable in Noise) or have a traumatic, personal connection to the scene of the crime (Eric Bana in The Dry). But Baker transcends stereotype, bringing sleepy-eyed and sorrowful gravitas, with lots of thousand-yard stares and a slow way of speaking, as if Hurley is aware that time moves differently in this part of the world.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningIn reality the central location is Coober Pedy – the bizarre South Australian town where citizens live in underground dugouts to escape the blistering heat. Is it possible to maintain a circadian rhythm down there? Or is time itself stuck in limbo: never really day and never really night?This striking location, captured in Warwick Thornton’s vampire series Firebite, is presented by the multi-hyphenate Sen (also Limbo’s cinematographer, writer, editor and composer) in the aforementioned spartan-looking monochrome, which adds an extra layer of spareness to environments that already have a vast and empty feeling. The film looks better the closer Sen’s cameras get to the ground – birds-eye drone shots, which the director has deployed before, losing their earthy lustre and becoming oddly mechanical-looking in black and white.Sign up to Saved for LaterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsafter newsletter promotionThe monochrome aesthetic is also a bit of a pathos-o-matic, helping the cast hit their plaintive notes. Sometimes characters converse as if there’s vast valleys between them; sometimes they cut right to the bone. When Hurley informs the victim’s brother Charlie (Rob Collins) that he’s revisiting the case with “fresh eyes”, Charlie responds: “We needed fresh eyes 20 fuckin’ years ago.”Part of the film’s lingering sadness comes from the knowledge that Hurley, and the police force he represents, is doing far too little, far too late. We know that authorities would have handled the case very differently had the murdered girl been white.An ageing white man, Joseph (a very scabby-looking Nicholas Hope), might know something about what happened: he certainly seems to have regrets, though here they’re not in short supply. The victim’s sister Emma (Natasha Wanganeen) is a little more welcoming than Charlie, though everybody in this film has a lost, faded look in their eyes. These are people who don’t seem to hope for much, other than perhaps to be left alone. The cast, in weather-beaten and woebegone mode, are uniformly excellent, directed by Sen in beautiful unison, their performances different notes in the same melody.Limbo isn’t, as you might have guessed, the kind of film in which all wrongs are righted and truth and justice restored. The story has an aura of compelling pointlessness, odd as that may sound, stemming from the sheer distance felt between the crucially important events of the past – when Charlotte disappeared and the “real” drama occurred – and the hazy aftermath of the present. Elements of the script share similarities with Stan’s series Black Snow, in which another dozy detective, played by Travis Fimmel, tries to find the truth about a terrible crime many years after the fact.From a structural point of view, Black Snow took the easy option, flashing between past to present. Limbo is all about the gap between then and now, about being dislocated from time, unable to move forwards or backwards and too old to start again; the state of the characters’ lives, in other words.Sen achieves something quite difficult: telling a story not about action or intrigue per se, but turning the dramatic arena into something more like an ellipsis: an ever-unanswerable space, where crucial things are omitted. It takes a calculated, studious sort of audacity to make a film like this, and a deep-thinking humanitarianism to fill it with such pathos.Limbo   premiered at Berlin film festival; it is out in cinemas in Australia from 18 May"
Occupied City review – Steve McQueen’s moving meditation on wartime Amsterdam ,The monumental film which tracks day-to-day life in Amsterdam under Nazi rule asks hard questions of what we think about the gulf between past and present ,5,"Steve McQueen’s monumental film is a vast survey-meditation on the wartime history and psychogeography of his adopted city: Amsterdam, based on his wife Bianca Stigter’s Dutch-language book Atlas of an Occupied City, Amsterdam 1940-1945.With a calm and undemonstrative narrative voiceover from Melanie Hyams, the film tracks day-to-day life in Amsterdam under Nazi rule. It spans the invasion in 1940; the establishment of the NSB, the collaborationist Dutch Nazi party; the increasingly brutal repression and deportation of Jewish populations to the death camps; and then the “hunger winter” of 1944 to 1945 as food and fuel became scarce in the city and the Nazis displayed a gruesome mix of panic and fanaticism as the allies closed in.What McQueen does is effectively represent the maps and figure legends of the book on screen: the camera shows us the modern-day indoor and outdoor scenes on individual streets, canals, squares, buildings and jetties where the barbarity unfolded – but shows them as they are now, with 21st-century people going about their business while Hyams’ narration coolly summarises what happened in each particular spot, sometimes adding that the original building has been “demolished”. A prison yard where Jews were forced to parade around chanting: “I am a Jew, beat me to death, it’s my own fault” is now an open space overlooked by the Hard Rock Cafe. The headquarters of the secret police was on the site of what is now a school.Occupied City lasts a little more than four hours, with an intermission, and the effect is something like an huge cinematic frieze or tapestry, or perhaps an installation. But it is also like an old fashioned “city symphony” movie, and, in its approach, perhaps bears the influence of Claude Lanzmann’s Shoah. It asks hard questions of what we think about the gulf between past and present. When we think about Nazi rule in Amsterdam, we think of … what? Flickering black-and-white newsreel footage, semi-familiar landmarks in monochrome, images of swastikas, an alien display of history, vacuum-sealed in the past. But McQueen shows us the modern world, in 4K resolution and there is a gradual realisation that for those involved in 1940, the Nazi occupation of Amsterdam happened just like this: in living colour in the here-and-now, with modern hairstyles and clothes.Sometimes there is a disconnect between past and present. The site of a bygone horror might in 2023 be a scene of happiness: people ice-skating on a frozen canal and having innocent fun. At some other place we see a commemorative event: the laying of wreaths. At other times, there will be a parallel: in Dam Square the Nazi occupiers erected a bandstand; now we see a stage for outdoor performance. And then there are other, serious engagements with history and politics. We see an official statement of apology for colonialism and slavery; we see a huge and boisterous “climate strike” by young people and an event for the murdered Dutch investigative journalist Peter R de Vries. The effect is to show us that the past and present are not clear, with distinct layers of old/significant and new/insignificant: it is more fluid than that.Occasionally, there is a weird frisson. Some of McQueen’s footage was shot during the Covid lockdown and the juxtaposition of this with Nazi oppression takes us – unintentionally – perhaps a little close to GB News territory. And audiences might be surprised at how little emphasis is placed on Anne Frank: it could well be that McQueen wanted to take us away from well-trodden arguments, and certainly to move away from the modern tourist cliches of coffee shops and sex worker windows. Although on that last point there is another eerie historical echo in the way in which sexual activity between occupier and occupied was variously policed, tolerated and punished.In its scale and seriousness, Occupied City allows its emotional implication to amass over its running time. The effect is mysterious and moving. Occupied City screened at the Cannes film festival and is released on 9 February in UK and Irish cinemas."
Local Hero review – wistful 80s comedy snares your heart with charm and beauty,"Bill Forsyth’s happy-sad tale about a fishing village under threat from US oil money is as wonderful as ever, with standout turns from Burt Lancaster and youthful Peter Capaldi",5,"Bill Forsyth’s wonderfully wistful and charming comedy is rereleased after 40 years, and its happy-sad aroma is still as pungent as ever. It has a claim to be the last movie with the authentic spirit of the Ealing comedies; although with a longer perspective we can also see how it’s also indirectly influenced by producer David Puttnam in its high-minded spirit of Anglo-American amity.The scene is a fictional fishing village in western Scotland, making its modest living from the lobster bound for the fancy restaurants of London and Paris, but which the locals can’t afford to eat. Peter Riegert plays Mac, a junior oil executive from Texas obsessed with work and material values, who has been tasked by his eccentric billionaire boss, Felix Happer, to travel to this village and persuade the entire community to sell up so that Happer can build a refinery there and capitalise on the new gush of North Sea oil. (There is a scene in which Happer appears to get a call from Margaret Thatcher in person.) Happer is played with unique brio and gusto by Burt Lancaster, whose legendary presence in itself confers something magical on the proceedings.Slowly but surely, hard-hearted capitalist Mac is beguiled by the beauty of the place and the gentleness of the locals, including the local hotelier-slash-accountant Gordon Urquhart, played by Denis Lawson; and poor Mac falls unrequitedly in love with his wife, Stella (Jennifer Black). There is also the refinery’s researcher Danny Oldsen, played by a boyish Peter Capaldi; there is nothing here of the brutal political spin doctor he played on TV’s The Thick of It, but in the part’s wit and whimsy, you might see the ghost of Capaldi’s other great role: Doctor Who.Danny has himself formed a tendresse for the company’s marine biologist Marina (played with dry wit by Jenny Seagrove), who swims with mermaid grace around the shore. Perhaps all too late, Mac confronts two dilemmas: he is falling in love with a landscape and a community that he is there to destroy, and he realises that his money-grubbing life in the big city is pretty pointless. In any case, the deal might not even go through: a hermit figure called Ben, who owns the beach, might not sell. He is played with terrific presence by Fulton Mackay – a lovely performance, and very different from his fierce prison warder in TV’s Porridge.In the early 80s, the idea of building an oil refinery didn’t have the frisson of darkness that it might have now, although this movie certainly saw that drilling for oil meant despoiling nature, and also that the oil business had a high-handed attitude to local communities who didn’t speak English. (The script skates over the question of whether Happer would pay the locals as much money for building an observatory as he would for an oil refinery.) But Local Hero snares your heart because it takes on a fantasy element: something to do with Happer’s visionary obsession with the stars. When he arrives in Scotland by helicopter, it’s as if he’s comes down from another planet: America. It’s such a pleasure to see it again. Local Hero is released on 19 May in cinemas."
The week in theatre: August in England; Blue Now; The Vortex – review ,"Bush theatre, London; Theatre Royal Brighton; Chichester Festival theatreIn his powerful debut play, Lenny Henry draws his audience deep into the life – and its shattering – of a Windrush evictee; Derek Jarman’s final film is reverentially revisited; and Lia Williams and son ignite Noël Coward at his darkest",0,"Lenny Henry makes it look like the simplest thing in the world. He saunters on looking as if he will deliver a glorious turn. He ends by being seen as a fragment of dreadful history. It is rare for an actor to arouse the reaction that Henry gets when he comes on stage. It is recognition, expectation and exhilaration.Yet also something else. The audience seem to be saying: you are ours. A star, but one who will take us by the hand. Now he exercises the same power with his first play – a one-hander – in which he involves an audience in the appalling government treatment of the Windrush generation.Henry’s writing is so direct, so chattily circumstantial, that it is sometimes hard to remember that August in England is not autobiography. He speaks as August, a man who came to the UK from Jamaica when he was eight (“So did I,” shouts a woman in the row behind me), and found his father in bed with a woman not his wife. He got over it, formed a band (Black Fist), fell in love with a girl who watched him, paying more attention to his trousers than his face, had three children – whose photos are pinned at the back of the stage – suffered terribly at the death of his life companion, but also behaved badly. Oh, and discovered new love at the dentist.For all Henry begins cockahoop, hip swirling, bum winking, this is the opposite of a showoff show. Directed by Daniel Bailey and Lynette Linton, he takes his spectators deep into relaxed everyday life. Events are so humdrum that when the manila envelopes start arriving, questioning his right to live in England, they seem dotty, almost comical. Anyone would ignore them. Outrage lands eventually – with the demand he leave his home and go to the Jamaica he left more than 40 years earlier. Along with others. In the closing moments, documentary footage of Windrush evictees flashes up – and Henry himself quietly leaves the stage. Never has a history felt less like a case study.Thirty years ago this month, Derek Jarman made his last film. Blue was an urgent report from the frontline, chronicling the days in which Aids was causing the artist to go blind. The visual content was steady, intense: an unchanging screen of Yves Klein blue; the words were drawn from Jarman’s diaries; and Jarman’s own voice is heard, lowered, with interesting QE2 vowels.Blue was an evocation, and an act of bravery: telling the truth – both stark and elaborate, personal and mythical – in the face of fear and homophobia. Now Neil Bartlett has revisited the work with live performers: the result, Blue Now, is faithful to the original but less explosive.The screen is the same; unmoving, though when shades of delphinium, cobalt and cornflower are mentioned, it can seem to spring new depths. The words – apart, I think, from a mention of Kyiv alongside Bosnia – are unchanged. There are glimpses of the Styx, and a medical tally: 30 pills a day, some too big to swallow. Jarman thinks his diseased eye looks like a planet; his oculist suggests it is more like a pizza. Hours of uncertainty are recorded: “Hell is a Waiting Room.”The crunch of shingle and the whirring of the washing machine are familiar, but there is a new silky weave of electronic music composed by Simon Fisher Turner, who provided the original soundscape. Four narrators are also visible in front of the screen: Travis Alabanza, Jay Bernard, Joelle Taylor and Russell Tovey. Their voices are distinctive, but none overperform; each has a strong connection to the words. To the side, Ali Gordon provides another performance element, signing dextrously, hands swaying and diving to conjure music as well as words.It is a valuable recall, scrupulous and heartfelt. Yet no longer delivered by the writer at a time of danger, speaking to a less hostile world, it is not so much defiant as reverent. Not a gauntlet thrown down but homage offered up.Noël Coward is in the theatrical air. At the National, his music is rippling in The Motive and the Cue. At the Donmar, Private Lives is being staged as a drama of domestic thuggery. Now Daniel Raggett directs Coward’s most startling play, Though awkward around the edges, it features a dazzling central duo: Joshua James and Lia Williams (in real life mother and son) play the drug-addled young man and his mother, carrying on with a chap of about his age.At its premiere in 1924, when Coward himself starred, understudied by John Gielgud, The Vortex shocked with addiction, a suggestion of incest and lashings of adultery. It carries a further surprise for those who, overlooking the full-on patriotism of In Which We Serve, think of the playwright as a dandy in a dressing gown: its language is at times so forthright, so apparently un-Cowardly. Though darkness is at first undercover, an hour and a half later the sheath of wit is removed. The play ends in melodrama and moral denunciation.It is a hard arc to make convincing but Joanna Scotcher’s design charts it excitingly. The opening scene is amber and padded and tasselled and peach – and, oh, the pouffes! The closing moments are so bleak and bare that we might be watching Samuel Beckett: the furniture has gone; a strange, smoky delirium (lit by Zoe Spurr) has flitted and passed, and now all is bleached and exposed: mother and son are confronting the facts of their hectic, wretched lives.Raggett’s emphatic production is not quick enough to make the revelations and accusations really surprising. Yet Williams and James set the stage alight. He moves with a lassitude that at first seems nonchalance but becomes more saturnine as despair and addiction take over: sprawled on his back, he looks like an empty suit. Williams does not do the obvious raddled thing. Darting, arms waving like wings, checking her hair before she hugs, she is convincingly youthful. Yet hunched with her back to the audience, in a white dress of many plumy layers, she could be a dying swan.Star ratings (out of five)August in England ★★★★Blue Now ★★★The Vortex ★★★August in England is at the Bush theatre, London, until 10 JuneBlue Now is touring until 27 MayThe Vortex is at the Chichester Festival Theatre until 20 May"
Frederick Ashton: Links in the Chain review – fascinating study of a master choreographer,Available onlineLynne Wake’s film about Ashton is a compelling glimpse into the way his great works are reinterpreted by new generations of dancers,4,"One of the great privileges of writing about dance is that sometimes you find yourself in a rehearsal room when a ballet is being remounted, listening to one generation of dancers passing on to the next what they have been taught by a previous generation.One of the pleasures of Links in the Chain, Lynne Wake’s 2021 documentary about Frederick Ashton, is that it allows you to eavesdrop on similar conversations. Screening at a special event at the Royal Academy of Dance in London on Tuesday, with guest speakers including dancers Vadim Muntagirov and Francesca Hayward, it’s a beautifully edited insight into what Christopher Nourse of the Ashton foundation calls “the DNA of what is a national ballet”.The 40-minute film mixes archive footage and interviews of great Royal Ballet performances of the past with today’s dancers talking about what they have learned about the style created by the company’s founding choreographer. They emphasise the almost sacred nature of the steps. Anthony Dowell remembers that having a role created on you by Ashton was “like the holy grail”; when he teaches the Dance of the Blessed Spirits to Muntagirov, the younger dancer talks about hoarding each word “like a treasure”.Wayne Eagling created the role of Hamlet in Ashton’s Hamlet Prelude in 1977. His part was meant to be danced by Rudolf Nureyev; Ashton worked with Eagling while waiting for his star to turn up. “But then Rudolf did one performance and I did 15,” Eagling remembers. His partner in the work was the 58-year-old Margot Fonteyn. Her part was “a reminiscence of all the roles” that Ashton had made for her.Watching Fonteyn dance in rare film of Symphonic Variations in 1946, you note the freedom, as well as the steely technique. Seeing Hayward and William Bracewell learn the roles, new emphases emerge even as Eagling recalls the intent, essence and shapes of Ashton’s choreography. As Bracewell wisely remarks: “You give a different generation the same steps and they do them differently. That’s the beauty of it. It’s evolving.” Wake wisely and sensitively records it all. It is utterly fascinating.Frederick Ashton: Links in the Chain screening and Q&A is at the Royal Academy of Dance, London SW11, 16 May, 6.30pm. The documentary can also be viewed online via the Frederick Ashton Foundation’s YouTube channel"
"Still: A Michael J Fox Movie review – an intimate, uplifting star portrait","Self-effacing and wryly defiant, the Hollywood actor, diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease at 29, reflects on a life of two halves in Davis Guggenheim’s revealing documentary",4,"“I’m not pathetic,” declares actor turned activist Michael J Fox early on in this intimate, uplifting and frequently very funny documentary about his life. “I’ve got shit going on. I’m a tough son of a bitch.” On the evidence presented here – a dazzling collage of interviews, dramatisations, snappily chosen film and TV clips, family footage and narrated biography – it’s hard to disagree.Having achieved stardom in his early 20s, Fox found himself in his 30s hiding from, and then publicly facing up to, a diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease – a condition that he believed (as many do) only affected older people. As he says with genuine surprise: “I was not someone who was supposed to get this.” Yet as we learn from this wryly defiant portrait by Davis Guggenheim, whose documentary CV includes the Oscar-winning An Inconvenient Truth and the empowering He Named Me Malala: “Some people would view the news of my disease as an ending, but I was starting to sense that it was really a beginning.”As a child, Michael Fox (the “J” was added later as an actorly affectation) was always on the move, constitutionally unable to sit still. It was partly that kinetic quality that landed him teenage roles in TV shows such as Leo and Me in the 1970s, although it wasn’t until he finally bagged the Alex P Keaton character in Family Ties in the early 1980s that his career became anything to write home about (Fox hilariously remembers Robert Redford flossing his teeth throughout his failed audition for the 1980 awards winner Ordinary People).Initially a supporting player, Fox became the star of Family Ties thanks to his electrifying comic timing – a scene-stealing ability to make the softest of gags land with a bang. No wonder producer Steven Spielberg pursued him for Robert Zemeckis’s sci-fi comedy Back to the Future, which they had already started filming with Eric Stoltz, and that Fox wound up reshooting around the edges of Family Ties. A punishing three-and-a-half months of “confusion and exhaustion” followed that left Fox wondering: “How could any of this shit be good?”Looking back on the whirlwind success that followed (Back to the Future and Fox’s “B-grade high school werewolf movie” Teen Wolf held the two top spots at the box office), our self-effacing subject notes: “I was king of the world, [but just] playing a part.” In the reflective present-day interviews, he sports a bruised face after breaking his cheek on the furniture, and explains: “It’s part of the deal that I fall. Gravity is real, even if you only fall from my height.” It’s a great one-liner that harks back to his earliest awards acceptance speeches (“I feel four feet tall!”) and reminds us that Fox’s wit has only got sharper over the years.As anyone familiar with his written memoirs will know, Fox’s self-deprecation extends to connecting the “diminished blinking and reduced spontaneity of facial expression” of Parkinson’s with the appearance of “a growing comfort in front of the camera – less mugging and hamming it up”. It’s a “tough son of bitch” indeed who can conclude they weren’t getting “better”, just “sicker”, and speak with such candour about the acting tics and drug regimes they employed to hide their symptoms. While frenetic illustrative clips show the energetic young Fox running and jumping his way through Back to the Future and Casualties of War, Guggenheim here mines lesser-known films such as 1993’s The Concierge (AKA For Love or Money) and the TV hit Spin City to illustrate how Fox kept his hands occupied to stave off tremors on camera.The real revelations, however, lie in the depiction of Fox’s family life, most notably his marriage to actor Tracy Pollan, who first won his heart by calling him “a complete fucking asshole”, and whose unswerving love leaves him all but speechless when he’s asked what she means to him, save for one word: “Clarity”. Ironically, while the symptoms of Parkinson’s may create the impression that Fox is never at rest, his relationship with Pollan and their children seems to have finally granted him the stillness he never had. As with the singer Edwyn Collins and his wife, Grace Maxwell, in the wonderful 2014 doc The Possibilities Are Endless, we’re left with the feeling that what we are really watching is a great love story. “How’s Tracy?” Guggenheim asks Fox in one unguarded moment. “Married to me,” he replies, before adding with perfect timing: “… still.”In selected cinemas and on Apple TV+"
The Eight Mountains review – gorgeously shot tale of male bonding in the Alps,Childhood friends reunite as adult mountaineers to pay an emotional debt to their shared father figure in this sweeping Italian-language drama,4,"Pietro and Bruno are brothers in everything but blood. Their friendship was forged during one glorious pre-adolescent summer, when Pietro’s parents rented a house in the Aosta valley in the Italian Alps, in a village in which Bruno was the only remaining child. The lifelong bond between them also links both to the rocky, vertebral peaks that were their childhood playground: as adults, both find themselves drawn to mountains. Bruno (Alessandro Borghi), a montanaro or mountain man at heart, stays put in the Aosta region; nomadic Pietro (Luca Marinelli) roams the world but finds a spiritual home in the Himalayan foothills.There’s another link: Pietro’s father, Giovanni (Filippo Timi), whom his son dismissed as a grey-faced Turin wage slave, finds adventure and release scaling the Alpine trails. As a young adult Pietro drifts away from his parents, while Bruno finds a surrogate father figure in Giovanni. It’s only after the latter’s death that Pietro realises he has missed out on knowing his father at his happiest and most fulfilled. In his honour, the two friends rekindle their relationship and fulfil Giovanni’s dream, of building a lodge on a plot of land high on the verdant flank of a mountain.Gorgeously photographed in a boxy academy ratio that emphasises the steep, breathlessly vertiginous angles of the landscape, this Italian-language and regional dialect production is an impressive first directing collaboration between Belgian husband-and-wife team Felix van Groeningen (The Broken Circle Breakdown, Beautiful Boy) and actress and writer Charlotte Vandermeersch. Sweeping and novelistic in scope, the film, adapted from an Italian bestseller by Paolo Cognetti, combines the earthy, rooted grit of Jack London with the vivid emotional landscapes of Elena Ferrante."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 review – a big-hearted emotional rollercoaster,"Putting a cute raccoon centre stage, James Gunn is taking no chances with this slick, mischievous, supposedly final third instalment of the Marvel series",4,"While much of Marvel’s output has rather blurred together of late into a gaudy onslaught of overplotted multiverse-hopping, the Guardians of the Galaxy movies have, for better or worse, always had a distinctive personality. What elevates Vol 3 (supposedly the final film in the GOTG series) is the way it keeps that personality, nodding to the irreverent swagger that is a crucial component of the Guardians USP while delivering a series of devastating emotional sucker punches along the way.To achieve this, director and co-writer James Gunn takes the fail-safe, heartstring-twanging route of placing adorable animals in peril, exploring Rocket the raccoon’s traumatic backstory, and touching on some unexpectedly dark themes – eugenics and vivisection – in the process. There’s a kinship with Bong Joon-ho’s Okja: both pictures celebrate loyalty and friendship while also acknowledging humanity’s capacity for unimaginable cruelty to other species.As a young, impossibly cute kit, Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) fell into the hands of the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji), a mad scientist with a God complex who believes that a perfect society starts in a macabre animal-testing laboratory. Rocket escaped, but in doing so he was separated from his soulmate, Lylla (Linda Cardellini), a pure-hearted otter with prosthetic metal arms. Now the High Evolutionary wants to recapture his most successful experimental subject, and he sends beautiful, gilt-edged dullard Adam Warlock (Will Poulter, great fun) to reclaim the raccoon.Classic rock needle drops and showy, snaking, single-shot action sequences – both GOTG trademarks – abound in a picture that balances a slightly overstuffed storyline with mischief, humour and the biggest of hearts."
Star Wars Jedi: Survivor review – a blockbuster with maverick energy,"Respawn Entertainment/ EA; PlayStation 5 (version tested), Xbox Series X/S, PCThe influence of Hidetaka Miyazaki saturates the rhythms of combat, character acrobatics and sweeping vistas of the finest Star Wars game in years",4,"Whatever you feel toward the game director Hidetaka Miyazaki’s fantasy oeuvre – Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Sekiro and Elden Ring, a constellation of hits often referred to as the “Soulsborne” set – the impact of his studio FromSoftware’s work on the blockbuster video game industry is, with the arrival of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, indisputable. This most mainstream of brand-Disney endeavours has been shaped in ways both obvious and subtle by the gravitational force of Miyazaki’s one-time niche designs.You play as Cal Kestis, a maverick Jedi unconcerned by the traditions of his order (you can dress Cal in any old scrubby T-shirt and cargo pants you collect in a remote treasure chest; no monkish robes here), who wields his lightsaber (also customisable) like a rapier. The rhythm of fights against droids, stormtroopers and 15ft rancors is moderated by participants’ stamina, which drains with each strike, recuperating only in moments of retreat – a quintessential Miyazaki design. Health is restored at glowing meditation spots, places of sanctuary where ability points are spent expanding Cal’s moves, but which also resurrect the local enemies.And soon enough you take over a derelict saloon, where you collect the friends you make on your journey (many of whom use their practical skills to repair and upgrade the cantina). The game’s sweeping vistas are Tatooine filtered through Elden Ring, while Cal’s ability to wall-run and hook-shot his way across the landscape with bungee ropes recalls Sekiro’s ninja acrobatics. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is not the first theme-tribute to FromSoftware’s work, but it’s the most successful yet – a more accessible interpretation, certainly, but one that results in the finest Star Wars game in years, and shows how ideas from the fringes still have the power to reshape a medium."
Streaming: the best winners of Cannes’ Palme d’Or,"Twenty-one films will vie for the top spot at the 76th Cannes film festival, which starts next week, hoping to join the roll call of past classics, from Taxi Driver and M*A*S*H to Parasite",0,"We’re a week away from this year’s Cannes film festival, and I’m among those tensing with excitement. With new works from Martin Scorsese, Jonathan Glazer, Alice Rohrwacher and Todd Haynes, among others, it’s a tasty lineup. Twenty-one films – seven by female directors, a record for the fest – are jostling for the Palme d’Or, with reigning champion Ruben Östlund leading the jury to determine his successor.Arguably the most prestigious prize in world cinema, the Palme d’Or nonetheless has a curious legacy. It is subject first to the biases of a festival selection committee that picks the annual handful of contenders, and second to the whims of nine celebrity jurors, who change every year. Though it has a loftier reputation than the best picture Oscar – with which it has only aligned twice in 75 years – it likewise has a history of eccentric calls: take 1986, for example, when Andrei Tarkovsky’s shattering swansong The Sacrifice was pipped by Roland Joffé’s starchy The Mission. David Lynch’s Palme came for one of his most uneven films, Wild at Heart; David Cronenberg has never won one.Yet by occasional collision of good taste and good fortune, the prize has been bestowed on enough enduringly great films over the years that it retains its lustre. In its best years, it has even planted a flag for the new. 1967’s win for Michelangelo Antonioni’s sculptural, counterculture-influenced anti-mystery Blow-Up has aged very handsomely. Robert Altman’s triumph for the randy, raucous antiwar comedy M*A*S*H a few years later was an early ratification of the New Hollywood movement. Later that decade, Francis Ford Coppola deservedly won twice for the ingeniously paranoid The Conversation (Paramount+) and the epically deranged Apocalypse Now. And when Martin Scorsese’s haunted, post-Vietnam nightmare Taxi Driver took the Palme over the protests of that year’s jury president, Tennessee Williams, the generational handover was confirmed.In 1989, a new wave of American independent cinema was announced when 26-year-old Steven Soderbergh won for his scuzzy, tangled relationship study Sex, Lies, and Videotape. In the mid-90s, Quentin Tarantino’s Pulp Fiction landed the prize for meshing arthouse and hyperviolent B-movie tropes with such abandon that its imitators still abound today.Moving away from American cinema – as Cannes largely has of late, with no US film taking the Palme since Terrence Malick’s glinting spiritual opus The Tree of Life 12 years ago – the prize has had equal success in recognising major international auteurs, from Italian Luchino Visconti’s win for the grandiose sociopolitical swirl in The Leopard to, just three years ago, South Korea’s Bong Joon-ho, with his wicked class-clash thriller Parasite.Kurosawa has one, for the ravishing samurai warfare of Kagemusha; so does Apichatpong Weerasethakul for his woozy reincarnation meditation Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives. Among my favourite Palme winners, Wim Wenders landed his for a wistful outsider’s view of crushed American dreams in Paris, Texas, and Lars von Trier for a more violently expressive variation on that theme in his exhilarating experimental musical Dancer in the Dark (Amazon, Curzon). And while Britain has a healthy track record at Cannes, with Palmes for Ken Loach, Mike Leigh and Richard Lester among others, our finest hour at the festival might just be Lindsay Anderson winning for his volatile, still startling school rebellion drama If…Most of these films have a prominent place in the canon, yet some of the greatest Palme d’Or winners aren’t as widely seen or screened. For years I put off watching Ermanno Olmi’s The Tree of Wooden Clogs (Mubi), a three-hour portrait of a 19th-century peasant community, only to be entranced by its richly inhabited vigour and wit. After not being available online for some time, I was pleased to see that Japanese director Shôhei Imamura’s The Ballad of Narayama can now be streamed on Arrow. About the ritual abandonment of elders to die, it sounds forbidding but has a viscerally poetic payoff. Another happy find is Mikhail Kalatozov’s The Cranes Are Flying, an intensely moving, humane study of a young Russian woman’s emotional turmoil in wartime, available to stream for free on the official YouTube channel of its studio, Mosfilm.Would that all winners were so easy to access: Luis Buñuel’s extraordinary Viridiana and the only winner by an African film-maker, the Algerian war epic Chronicle of the Burning Years, are among those currently missing from the streaming realm. As for the 1966 winner, minor sex farce The Birds, the Bees and the Italians, suffice to say that a Palme d’Or doesn’t assure you a spot in the collective cultural memory.Enys Men (BFI) Speaking of Cannes, Cornish indie film-maker Mark Jenkin’s latest premiered at last year’s festival – and its cult of admirers are still chewing on the metaphysical, time-slipping folk horror puzzle it presents, in which the coastal landscape takes on an intangible aura of threat. Count me among those slightly disappointed, however: after the bracing authenticity of Jenkin’s shoestring debut, Bait, this feels sleeker but less striking.Marcel the Shell With Shoes On (Universal; available 8 May) Nominated for this year’s best animated feature Oscar, this hyper-whimsical stop-motion miniature from director Dean Fleischer Camp and comedian Jenny Slate was the clear hipsters’ choice, with its mixture of arch mockumentary framing and cute underdog comedy about a plucky anthropomorphic seashell seeking his long-lost family. The twee factor is high but the execution is daintily clever.Honk for Jesus. Save Your Soul. (Universal) Perhaps unsurprisingly passed over for a cinema release in the UK, where the satirical target of American megachurches is less likely to resonate with audiences, this is a messy but often jaggedly funny tale of a southern Baptist pastor’s wife attempting to rebuild a congregation in the wake of her husband’s scandalous downfall. Regina Hall’s gutsy, all-in performance holds it together."
Harka review – drama of rage and frustration that sparked the Arab Spring,"Dramatising the tragedy of a Tunisian man inspired by street vendor Mohamed Bouazizi, Lotfy Nathan’s film draws on deep sorrow and anger",4,"Lotfy Nathan has drawn from a deep well of sorrow and rage for this anguished drama, leading the audience to its horrible dénouement like a trail of burning petrol: the title itself means “burning” (and also, ambiguously, escaping by boat). It is inspired by the story of Mohamed Bouazizi, the Tunisian street vendor who in 2011 ignited the Arab Spring (all too literally) by setting himself on fire outside the governor’s office in the central Tunisian city of Sidi Bouzid – making it the uprising’s Ground Zero – in protest against official corruption and the police who had beaten him when he could no longer pay their bribes.Adam Bessa plays Ali, a young guy who sells black-market petrol on a street corner, paying off hatchet-faced cops as he does so while dreaming of escaping across the Mediterranean to Europe for a better life. He is also pressured into doing more dangerous fuel smuggling at the border with Libya; Mahamat-Saleh Haroun’s 2013 film GriGris also touches on Africa’s illegal gasoline trade. We see Ali listening with resentful fascination to some blowhard in a local bar, boasting about how great it’s been for him in Germany.But just as Ali’s migrant dream looks like becoming a reality, his father dies, leaving him to look after his two younger sisters, Alyssa (Salima Maatoug) and school-age teen Sarra (Ikbal Harbi); he also discovers that his brother Skander (Khaled Brahem), who had previously been in charge of these siblings, is now leaving with his wife for a waiter job at a tourist cafe on the coast. And to top it all, Ali discovers that his father had bad debts and they are about to lose the house.Harka shows what triggers Ali most of all is visiting Skander at the resort and sensing the white vacationers’ fear and contempt for him. He broods over the vastness of the sea: for tourists it is a luxury spectacle, for him the barrier to escape. It’s a powerful movie and Bessa’s performance is excellent. Harka is released on 5 May in UK cinemas."
"Isaac Julien: What Freedom Is to Me review – ghosts, dandies and seduction","Tate Britain, LondonLuxurious, dreamlike and made to carry the weight of race, sex and politics, the free-roaming films of Isaac Julien beguile but mystify",3,"Isaac Julien presents 11 films at Tate Britain with a combined running time so voluminous you might want to make a day of it, with respite for lunch. They include a group of early works from the 1980s, screened on monitors and walls outside the exhibition, and seven multiscreen films in darkened theatres within. Copious seating, sumptuous carpets, ideal viewing ratios, barcodes that let you watch again later back home: everything has been arranged for your comfort.Which is worth bearing in mind as you witness the works of this inveterate seducer. Born in 1960, and starting out with experimental documentaries about police brutality, black life and culture in London, Julien found fame early on with Looking for Langston (1989). What he calls a “meditation” on the ambiguously queer identity of the black US poet Langston Hughes set out the elements of his style: fact interspersed with fiction, documentary with drama, drifting dreamscapes with archive footage, montages of dance, song and monologue, the camera hovering on beautiful people and places.Acclaimed as the first art film made about the historical condition of being both black and gay, this cult work glitters on continuous loop at the heart of the show, and if you start here something particular starts to emerge. The film opens with an imaginary vision of Hughes’s funeral, the deceased played by Julien himself, motionless against white drapes in a coffin. This is an art of commemoration.Here is A Marvellous Entanglement (2019), honouring the wild architecture of the Italian modernist Lina Bo Bardi, filmed across seven public buildings she designed for Brazil. Some are still in use, with their cave-mouth doors and windows and their curious cylinders of light. Others are derelict, and haunted by the spirit of the architect herself, played by two different women.They wander through her art museum, where the paintings project from resin bases like gravestones in a cemetery, down spiralling staircases, followed by dancers in descending flurries, through Bo Bardi’s São Paulo theatre with its bare wooden seats. They give utterance to her strong opinions (against upholstery, in favour of mud), in particular her idea that time is not linear but “a marvellous entanglement, where at any moment, points can be chosen and solutions invented, without beginning or end”. Which might stand as the definition of Julien’s own free-flowing films, which so studiously avoid mounting into narrative.There are other wraiths. A Regency dandy dances through the convoluted spaces of Sir John Soane’s Museum, apparently observed only by a black curator (the voiceover is in Creole, as if Julien did not want you to comprehend). A famous performance by one of China’s great silent movie stars, Ruan Lingyu, is reprised by the contemporary actor Zhao Tao in the streets of old Shanghai. The abolitionist and freedom fighter Frederick Douglass, played by Ray Fearon, gives a visionary lecture to an audience of Edinburgh Victorians, two of whom are moved to make their own protest in crinolines, while his second wife sits stitching a blue coat for him and his (abandoned) first wife sits pensively for a daguerreotype: the shadow of her existence caught on camera. That coat is cobalt, like his first wife’s dress. A dancer whirls in flaring scarlet.The Chinese movie turns from monochrome into magenta, cerise, cerulean and lime. Julien’s high interest in colour extends to the aspect of every single thing in every scene. His camera dwells on shimmering makeup, coiffed hair, buttons, stitches and velvet, on honed bodies and chiselled faces, bentwood furniture and the breeze lifting a gauzy blind. It slips in and out of The World of Interiors.Hot colours, languid imagery, the focus on showy details, all of it converges with the smooth movement of each film – gliding gradually through buildings, forests and cities, on trams, trains and slow boats. Occasionally, as in Ten Thousand Waves, partly shot on location in Shanghai Film Studios, it pans back to show the camera crews at work. This acknowledgment of the means of making goes straight to Julien’s modus operandi: glossy, luxurious, swanky aesthetics made to carry a burden of theory.The latest work here is Once Again… (Statues Never Die), from 2022, commissioned and filmed at the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia. André Holland (of Moonlight fame) plays the black philosopher and theorist Alain Locke, who was unmistakably gay, and pursued the young Langston Hughes. Locke appears in dialogue with Albert Barnes (played by Danny Huston), debating the status of the African art Barnes bought for his collection in the 1920s, which “is in danger of becoming a fashion or fad”.Their conversation is intercut with footage from You Hide Me, a 1970 film shot by Ghanaian artist Nii Kwate Owoo in the British Museum stores arguing for the repatriation of the Benin bronzes. There are fragments of a 1953 Chris Marker film, extracts from Looking for Langston and a subplot in which Locke falls in love with the black artist Richmond Barthé. It all streams before you in coruscating black and white on five double-sided screens, themselves reflected in mirrors all around the gallery, and with a spectacular score and arias performed by the black singer Alice Smith. But still it remains a lecture swathed in silver-screen glamour.It is a risk, even in art film, to be so averse to narrative, pace or tension. Form and content sometimes seem so separate and inert in these works as to make you wonder what is even being attempted. Why is there a second actor playing Bo Bardi, when she mainly seems to repeat the first? Why is there such emphasis on the Scottish skies when Douglass pays his Edinburgh visit? Why does Julien suddenly show the Chinese goddess Mazu (Maggie Cheung), fabled for leading fishers to safety, being hauled back and forth in a harness against a green screen? It is the most atrocious bathos.The more so because this film is a requiem, of sorts, for the 23 Chinese cocklepickers who died in Morecambe Bay in 2004. An emergency phone call is played out over footage of terrifying tides. We hear intensely elegiac lines from the poet Wang Ping. But then we’re straight back to cinematic old Shanghai. This is almost as tendentious as the stylised sequences in Julien’s 2007 Western Union: Small Boats, where dancers were actually choreographed to play immigrants drowning during fatal Mediterranean crossings. There comes a point where Julien’s “political lyricism”, to borrow a phrase from Derek Jarman, gets uncomfortably close to slick mannerism.Isaac Julien: What Freedom Is to Me is at Tate Britain, London, until 20 August"
Big George Foreman review – a heavy-handed boxing biopic,George Tillman Jr’s faith-centric drama plods through Foreman’s uplifting journey from troubled child to comeback king,2,"Like its subject, the heavyweight boxer turned preacher turned comeback champion boxer George Foreman (a physically transformed Khris Davis), this by-numbers biopic is hefty and powerful but not exactly light on its feet. The film is an uplifting plodder that takes in the boxer’s formative years, in a desperately poor and fervently devout family in Houston, Texas; his encounter with the inspirational trainer (Forest Whitaker) who helped him channel his anger into sporting excellence; his reconnection with his faith; and his “miraculous” late-life success.It’s solidly and safely directed by George Tillman Jr, but will likely appeal more to the Christian cinema crowd than to the sports movie audience.Big George Foreman is out in cinemas in the UK now and in Australia on 20 July."
Love According to Dalva review – disturbing but delicately handled French tale of parental abuse,"In Emmanuelle Nicot’s assured directorial debut, a young girl struggles to make a new life after being ​rescued from her predatory father",4,"Dalva (Zelda Samson) wears her honey-coloured hair in a soigné updo; her wardrobe consists of little black cocktail dresses and lace. Which would be fine, except for the fact that Dalva is just 12 and has been shaped and brainwashed by her predatory paedophile father. At the very start of the film, in a harrowingly raw scene, the police and social services rescue Dalva from the home she shares with her abuser. Conditioned by her father to believe herself to be one half of a great love affair, Dalva pines and struggles to connect with the other kids in the residential home where she is placed.It’s an uncomfortable watch, but this assured French-language debut from director Emmanuelle Nicot negotiates its disturbing subject matter with delicacy, sensitivity and honesty. In the central role, the magnetic Samson is a revelation."
Polite Society review – Nida Manzoor’s kickass ​celebration of sisterhood,A martial arts-obsessed teenager intervenes in her sibling’s forthcoming nuptials in this pinballing genre mashup from the director of C4’s We Are Lady Parts,3,"Adolescence is a messy place. Particularly so for girls such as Ria (Priya Kansara), who must negotiate the hostile territory of secondary school, grapple with emotions so intense they defy the laws of physics, and attempt to rescue her older sister Lena (Ritu Arya) from an impending marriage.The careering, erratic energy of this genre-hopping action fantasy from TV’s We Are Lady Parts creator Nida Manzoor is designed to capture the fizzing chaos inside the mind of the average teenage girl. It makes a pretty good fist of it too, with aspiring stuntwoman Ria crashing like a wrecking ball through her own life and those of everyone around her. But for all the inventive excess and extravagant martial arts sequences (not for nothing did the film draw comparisons to Everything Everywhere All At Once after its debut at Sundance), there’s a touch of children’s TV special naivety in the execution.Still, the pinballing plot is constantly surprising, and both Kansara and Arya sparkle in this kickass celebration of sisterly bonds."
Berg review – mesmeric documentary evokes terrifying majesty of the natural world,"Long static shots of Slovenian mountains combine with ambient drones in this abstract, contemplative film that contemplates nature’s patterns",3,"Here is a meditative documentary from Dutch film-maker Joke Olthaar that mostly consists of monochrome, long-held static shots, exquisitely filmed by cinematographer André Schreuders, of the mountains in Triglav National Park in Slovenia. It opens and closes with some airy voiceover musings about the abyss, solitude and all that jazz, and there are references to “the three of us” which chime with the three tiny, black, human-shaped blobs seen from time to time.But for the most part, there is no palpable story or shape to the film. Olthaar occasionally mixes in what looks like Super 8 footage of climbers and walkers pictured on a more human scale, and at one point a dead body is dug out of the snow. Yet none of that human activity is given any more weight than the shots of handsome goats hanging out on the crags, or the shifting patterns of sun and shadow flickering across the vast spaces.This is nature-based film-making taken to an almost abstract level, asking the viewer just to sit and contemplate the patterns of black, white and powdery grey that make up the mountainsides, majestic and terrifying all at once. The effect is so lulling and mesmeric that when the silence is suddenly pierced by the sound of a babbling brook of runoff water, it lands like a jump scare in a horror movie. Elsewhere there are sounds of the wind and a droning sort of background music composed by Rutger Zuydervelt that is reminiscent of the hums and crackles you might hear listening to BBC Radio 3’s Night Tracks when you’re falling asleep.This sort of thing is not going to be to everyone’s taste but for lovers of minimalist cinema it will be a treat, especially if viewed in a cinema with proper sound and top-notch projection. Berg is released on 28 April in UK cinemas"
My Everest review – disabled man’s Himalayan trek is the toughest of challenges,"Adventure film follows Max Stainton, who has cerebral palsy, as he battles expectations and great physical pain to reach the Everest base camp",3,"Financial analyst Max Stainton has cerebral palsy and is a wheelchair user – “Give me a maths problem, I’ll be fine. Don’t ask me to put on my shirt,” he quips – and director Carl Woods, in his debut documentary, follows Stainton on a two-week charity trek to Everest base camp on horseback. Horse riding is incredibly demanding physically for Stainton, and this film is not only a fly-on-the-wall adventure doc, but an insight into the frustrations of being disabled and constantly dealing with other people’s stereotypes and assumptions.It begins at home in London where Stainton lives with his partner, Candy. Giggling, they describe meeting when she was hired as his PA, and they fancied each other like mad. (“Inappropriate!”) Stainton explains that, with the trek, what he wants is to challenge society’s perceptions, the pigeonholing of him as that guy in a wheelchair. “TRAIN TRAIN TRAIN” says a sticker on the fridge. So, he does endless crunches with his physiotherapist, and walks up and down the stairs in his block of flats.In the cold and altitude of Nepal, the trek turns out to be far more challenging than Stainton and his team anticipated. Candy, who admits that the Himalayas are not exactly her thing, struggles. For Stainton, the two weeks are physically painful and draining; on the toughest day he’s kicked by the horse four times and ends up walking uphill for six hours.Reaching base camp is an incredible personal achievement but in the interview at home afterwards – which to be honest could have been more probing – Stainton evaluates the cost. The trip has left him more disabled and living with pain. He wonders if he’s been judging his self-worth by other people’s expectations too much. As Candy says, working with macho finance bros doesn’t help. It feels like a bitter finish to the film, but then comes a lovely happy ending – spoiler alert! – of a wedding and a baby. My Everest is released on 28 April in UK cinemas."
The Passion of Remembrance review – absorbing fusion of black radicalism and feminism,Inventive hybrid uses drama and archive video montage to examine the intersections of different liberation struggles,4,"Here is a 1986 film co-directed by radical feminist film-maker Maureen Blackwood with artist-director Isaac Julien. Their sensibilities are a fruitful match here, creating a knotty, complex, self-questioning piece of work: drama, essay movie and video art crossover. Blackwood and Julien were drawing on the black power radicalism of the 60s and the feminism of the 80s in ways that could amount to a British new wave.In a stylised wilderness, a male and female figure confront each other ill-temperedly: the woman accusing the man of not allowing women any agency or space within the liberation movement. In a parallel realist drama, a family deals with racist abuse (often from off-duty police) and their own ideological and generational splits on the subject of injustice and empowerment, and how gay people of colour find themselves marginalised by the community from which they are hoping for support.Most striking in this movie are the extended montage sequences (the framing device being that these are the work of an art student): we see protests, demos and police confrontation which Blackwood and Julien have formed into a hypnotic and brilliant collage, tinting and grading the colour and adding a hip-hop soundtrack including the Aleem brothers. The effect is entirely absorbing; easily the most interesting and creative use of this kind of archive material I have ever seen. The Passion of Remembrance is released on 28 April in cinemas."
Endphase review – searing testimony to one of the last Nazi war crimes ,"Exemplary Austrian documentary chronicles the massacre of more than 200 women, children and older men just days before the end of the second world war",4,"With the far right on the up worldwide, it’s getting late in the day to exhume the lessons of the mid-20th century. There are few surviving Holocaust perpetrators and victims still living, but this exemplary Austrian documentary, an attempt to chronicle the massacre of Hungarian Jews in the Danube river community of Hofamt Priel, does its damnedest to track down and understand both sides before they are gone.Director Hans Hochstöger grew up in Hofamt Priel, a rural farming village about 100km west of Vienna, which was annexed to the larger town of Persenbeug. It was from a construction site on the river here that, on the night of 2 May 1945, the SS marched more than 200 refugees a short way inland and murdered them; an atrocity all the more senseless because the Nazis surrendered days later. Their remains, shoved into a ditch, were moved to a Jewish cemetery in 1964. But the killing was wilfully ignored and never investigated, unlike similar “endphase” incidents nearby, and only half-heartedly acknowledged in the form of a forlorn roadside memorial.Despite his calm narration, Hochstöger is disturbed by the pall the massacre still casts over his home village. Starting with a neighbour – who was present in a house opposite as it unfolded, and evidently still haunted by it – he methodically pulls words out of this silence. Most eloquent, even in their lapses or having to let another complete their testimony, are three survivors: Marton and Zev Vilmos Klein, two brothers who escaped death with their family because they were doing forced labour in a Budapest factory; and Yakov Tibor Schwarz, who as an 11-year-old hid under straw at the construction site as the SS machine-gunned the infirm and child prisoners.Uncovering the killers is more difficult: evidence suggests that Persenbeug’s mayor, a local doctor, a Nazi party member, and others collaborated with the SS. But they are long dead, and family members won’t talk. There is one reckoning: a description of an improbable and shocking reprisal recounted in archive footage by György Roth, another relative of the dead. Given these pitiless trajectories, you can only thank heaven for the counterbalancing goodness also on evidence here, especially the family who hid Schwarz in the forest, and the local police chief who tried unsuccessfully to bring a prosecution. This is an austere, searing act of testimony. Endphase is available on True Story on 28 April."
How to Blow Up a Pipeline review – explosively Tarantino-esque eco thriller,A young crew of protesters come together to destroy a Texas oil pipeline in Daniel Goldhaber’s fiercely watchable film,4,"Here is a fiercely watchable thriller which had me biting my nails down to the wrists. It is inspired partly by Andreas Malm’s radical eco-activist manifesto of the same title, and partly – in fact, almost pedantically – by the heist classic Reservoir Dogs. A young crew of protesters, each individually getting a backstory flashback which sometimes jumps into the drama at a cliffhanger moment, come together for the big job, knowing each other as little as Tarantino’s colour-coded bad guys and having similar issues around gunshot wound injury and possible disloyalty.Director and co-screenwriter Daniel Goldhaber applies a fictional imagination to the first two words in the title of Malm’s book, which argues for direct-action property destruction but is not actually a “how to” bomb-making guide like William Powell’s 1971 gonzo classic The Anarchist Cookbook; it is still in print and still assuredly being studied by climate activists. Goldhaber’s drama shows how this kind of paramilitary adventure might actually happen, month by month, moment by moment, as well as the kind of people who would be sufficiently motivated or reckless to risk decades in federal prison. They are all drawn together by a plan to blow up a west Texas oil pipeline, disrupt the flow and drive its price ruinously up.Interestingly, there is no clear leader, no one whose job is to explain to the gang (and the audience) what is going to happen, in scenes which would involve them standing in front of a whiteboard or a table with toy cars around a cardboard model. In so far as someone is in charge, it appears to be Michael (Forrest Goodluck), a bomb specialist: although the lightbulb moment of having the idea and finding the exact spot where a bomb could be planted are relatively unimportant and almost invisible.Michael is a young Native American who resents the oil rigs destroying his homeland; Xochitl (Ariela Barer) and Theo (Sasha Lane, from Andrea Arnold’s American Honey) are friends affected by big oil’s toxic pollution in their neighbourhood, and Theo’s girlfriend Alisha (Jayme Lawson) agrees to help. Dwayne (Jake Weary) is a Texan good ol’ boy and open-carry gun enthusiast who resents the government requisitioning his land, Shawn (Marcus Scribner) is disillusioned with the virtue-signalling futility of making documentary films about climate change, and Logan (Lukas Gage) and Rowan (Kristine Froseth) are seasoned campaigners.A regular heist movie is driven by cynicism and greed, undercut with a crime-doesn’t-pay anxiety; this film is therefore fundamentally unlike Tarantino’s, but it is also unlike say, Gillo Pontecorvo’s The Battle of Algiers from 1966 which shows the insurgents’ revolutionary motivation sympathetically, but without overtly asking the audience to share it. Another comparison might be Fred Zinnemann’s 1973 adaptation of Frederick Forsyth’s novel The Day of the Jackal, which presented us with the hitman’s thrillingly ice-cold professionalism in the (paid) service of a cause. Here, the pipeline destroyers are the good guys; an interesting genre twist though one which arguably defangs the film, just a little, removing the addictive flavour of cruelty and chaos, yet not making it any the less gripping and ingenious. How to Blow Up a Pipeline is released on 21 April in UK and Irish cinemas."
Pray for Our Sinners review – the Irish campaigners who took on brutal church abuse,Inspirational documentary recovers the stories of those who dared to question the treatment of children in a small Irish town,4,"Irish film-maker and journalist Sinéad O’Shea has a gripping and inspirational story to tell about her home town of Navan in Co Meath, and she tells it terrifically well, talking to the people involved, engaging with the history, delivering the drama and teasing out the poignancies and complexities.O’Shea is speaking to the people who stood up to church abuse in the 60s and 70s, at a time when challenging the Catholic authorities seemed unthinkable. There can hardly be anyone left now who doesn’t know something about Ireland’s coming to terms with the historical abuse sanctioned by the church and its treatment of young pregnant women in the brutal mother-and-baby houses and Magdalene Laundries, the subject of movies such as Stephen Frears’s Philomena and Peter Mullan’s The Magdalene Sisters. These were the workhouses of shame, or perhaps the refineries in which guilt and fear were extracted as fuel for the theocracy. Schools were the same, with their incessant beatings, carried out by unmarried men who had of course been beaten and humiliated themselves in their formative years: a theatre of cruelty where the punishment was the point. (England has nothing to be smug about: we had teachers routinely assaulting children in front of other children for reasons they perhaps couldn’t explain to themselves.)O’Shea returns to the nightmare of the dead infants buried in secret in the mother-and-baby house grounds; she shows that it was the result of callousness and incompetence but also something even more sinister; not all the babies could be adopted, the authorities had no great enthusiasm for maintaining embarrassing hordes of growing infants and they were frankly content for the horror and grief of infant mortality to be part of the young women’s punishment.But in Navan, some stood up against it all. O’Shea talks to Dr Mary Randles, who with her (now late) husband Dr Paddy Randles established in Navan the first family planning clinic in Ireland outside Dublin, and complained directly to the school when a young boy, Norman Murray, was viciously beaten simply for using his left hand to write, after his right arm was broken in a fall. Murray is interviewed here, and his dignity, courage and humility are moving, like all the other interviewees – particularly the women who were forced into these institutions, but whose babies were amazingly returned to them due to the Randles’ fearless intervention.When the authorities contemptuously rejected Randles’ complaint about corporal punishment, she tried taking the story to the Irish newspapers who refused to touch it. Finally the British News of the World ran the story in two parts, followed by America’s NBC News. But no one in Navan saw the TV item and as for the News of the World, the legend is that priests made sure that no copies carrying the second half were carried in Navan newsagents.This was all almost certainly done with the connivance of, or even under instruction from, Navan’s dynamic and much-admired priest, Father Andy Farrell, a man with the charisma of a young John F Kennedy. Farrell was in some ways a progressive figure who talked passionately about Christianity as socialism in action. But he was also a reactionary in sexual politics, colluding with the mother-and-baby racket, although very possibly with a heavy heart. O’Shea’s film concludes with a thoughtful, nuanced assessment of this important figure.Corporal punishment was finally outlawed in 1982, though the laundries continued in dwindling forms for many years afterwards. The nation of Ireland is vastly different now, but O’Shea shows this change was not inevitable, but the effect of courageous dissidents. Pray for Our Sinners is released on 21 April in Irish cinemas, and on Curzon Home Cinema."
A Clever Woman review – engagingly low-key English drama defies expectations,"This story of two sisters, played by Josie Lawrence and Tanya Myers, returning home to sort their dead mother’s belongings avoids predictable genres, narratives and characters",3,"British indie director Jon Sanders creates another of his low-key, thoughtful movies developed through improvisation; it is a static, eccentric chamber piece in some ways, but engaging and pregnant with ideas about mourning and grief. Josie Lawrence and Tanya Myers play Dot and Phoebe, two sisters who have come to the seaside home of their late mother, a singer and entertainer, to confront the daunting task of sorting out all her belongings and theatrical memorabilia.This opens up painful memories and psychic wounds: however much they loved her, their mother was serially unfaithful to their father – once with a boyfriend of Phoebe’s – and now they don’t know how to feel. These themes of sexual transgression are strangely echoed in the present action, as if the women’s mother is haunting the property. Their friend Monica (Anna Mottram) who has come to help them, is attracted to Tom (James Northcote), a young man who has been housesitting the property; she feels guilty about her husband, an excellent cameo from the late Bob Goody.It is difficult to know exactly what to make of A Clever Woman, but this is because Sanders is a very nonconformist film-maker, and his film does not match up to expected genres, expected narratives, expected characters. It doesn’t even resemble the kind of social realism that tends to get public funding, being unfashionably about the just-about-managing British middle classes. With its long takes, its melancholy evocation of theatre and quiet unhappiness, the film is almost Bergmanesque: but really too briskly comic for that comparison to be accurate.In some ways, Sanders is pursuing a kind of hyperlocal cinema, a cinema that follows its nose to various ideas and situations and then away from them. It’s a confident, controlled piece of work which gives us a sliver of Englishness. A Clever Woman is released on 21 April in UK cinemas."
Private Desert review – elegant love story blooms in Brazil’s uneasy backwaters,A macho ex-cop falls for a mysterious stranger in this romance that doubles as a subtle state-of-the-nation drama,4,"Apparently, the new arthouse flex is dropping your opening credits half an hour or more into the film, as in Drive My Car, Long Day’s Journey Into Night – and now Aly Muritiba’s desolate and sophisticated Brazilian romantic quest Private Desert. Here, it’s all the better to accentuate the barren terrain from which it emerges. Brawny police instructor Daniel (Bacurau’s Antonio Saboia) is suspended for attacking a recruit and forced to take on punishing night shifts as a security guard. At home he battles to convince his sister to do her fair share of caring for their dementia-stricken father, also a former policeman. Daniel’s only succour is the WhatsApp-based relationship he has with Sara, a woman somewhere in Brazil’s north. Then she starts ghosting him.Prologue done, Daniel snaps and hits the road in search of his Awol paramour. He flyposts the area near the inland city of Petrolina with shots of Sara. But when they finally cross paths under nightclub lights, she turns out not to be who she says. There is a change of styles from the intro’s sepulchral tableaus to something more loose and fluid, and Muritiba excels at infusing his drama with subtle state-of-the-nation resonance. There seem to be two Brazils, circling but constantly misunderstanding one another. Daniel – making jokes as his father puts his “pistol” away as he washes him – is in hock to sclerotic macho ideals. But are things any less unhappy elsewhere? The people around Sara – like Fernando (Thomas Aquino), the protective friend who screens Daniel – spin out exploitative fantasies but remain dependent on and defined by those whom they feed off.The romantic tussle rests on two astute performances. Saboia allows a kind of bug-eyed unease to dominate Daniel, despite his attempts at dick pic-taking insouciance. And, as his opposite number, Pedro Fasanaro cycles through disaffection, self-infatuation and an earnest search for self which is as urgent as the smitten copper’s. Perhaps there is something a bit too demonstrative about the eventual resolution, wrapped with the bow of the Bonnie Tyler belter Total Eclipse of the Heart. But Private Desert winds up somewhere surprisingly gentle. Private Desert is available on digital platforms on 24 April"
Renfield review – Nicolas Cage channels the spirit of Bela Lugosi,"Despite some fabulous B-movie fireworks between Cage and Nicholas Hoult, indiscriminate slaughter is committed in this anaemic Dracula film",2,"Garlic bulbs at the ready for Chris McKay’s horror-comedy: a cynical side-hustle of a picture, come to drain the extremities of the Bram Stoker estate and install a lowly pretender as king. As embodied by Nicholas Hoult, foppish Renfield wouldn’t look out of place in a genteel period romance. Instead, he’s spent the past century as Dracula’s grotesque familiar, gobbling insects for breakfast and sourcing new meat for his master. “A busload of cheerleaders,” demands the count at one point, as though he’s perusing the menu at his favourite bistro.Every generation, perhaps, gets the monster movie it deserves. This one practically bounces off the analyst’s couch, spouting the language of trauma, recovery and self-empowerment. Attending a support group, Renfield learns that he’s in a “codependent relationship” with a toxic narcissist and duly tries to strike out on his own, fighting big-city crime alongside Awkwafina’s lone honest cop. This, one assumes, is his big redemption arc, although in practice it chiefly involves indiscriminate comic-book slaughter. Limbs are lopped off. Heads explode like bombs. McKay gives us gallons of blood. Not much of it is fresh.The film’s most lively inhabitant, ironically enough, is Dracula himself, Renfield’s outraged boss. He’s played with a knowing gusto by Nicolas Cage, who appears to have reached the point in his career where he is essentially called on to play the role of Nic Cage. Here, he provides some fabulous B-movie fireworks, sporadically channelling the spirit of Bela Lugosi and making the most of his scant screen time. Your standard vampire film would have put Cage centre stage. Renfield, God help it, elects to bury the lede and drive a stake through his heart."
The Last Kingdom: Seven Kings Must Die review – gripping spin-off from Netflix show ,"There’s a ton of plot packed into this standalone movie derived from the TV series, but the deluge of detail gets steadily more absorbing",3,"Here is a standalone feature film and final capstone in Netflix’s British-made TV series The Last Kingdom, an epic in every sense of the word that’s based on novels by Bernard Cornwell and unfolds in the 10th century, just before the Norman invasion. Even if you’ve never seen a single episode from any of the show’s previous five seasons of dramatised yet highly researched British history, you’ll probably quite like to go back and start watching the whole saga from the beginning because it gets more gripping the more you surrender to it. This is largely down to the thoughtful way it tries to present a society composed of pagan Danes and Christian Saxons – and folks who are a bit of both – trying with some difficulty to all get along.The main dude is one such mixed-heritage chap named Uhtred (Alexander Dreymon), who apparently was born a Saxon but raised by Vikings and believes in the Norse gods. A fearsome warrior wielding a sword with a chunk of amber on the hilt, and a mane of tangled hair shaved at the sides so he looks like a new age traveller from the 1990s, Uhtred is the leader of a community in Northumbria, eschewing the title king. His alliance with the royal family of Wessex to the south is tested when newly crowned King Aethelstan (Harry Gilby) comes to power and is persuaded by his closest adviser Ingilmundr (Laurie Davidson) (a fanatical convert to Christianity) to use this moment to seize control of all Britain’s kingdoms, from the Shetland and Orkney islands to Wessex. There are, as the title might imply, eight kings in all, but the wife of a friend of Uhtred’s with a history of making prophecies foretells that seven of them will die.There’s a ton of plot crammed tightly into the running time, but director Edward Bazalgette manages the storytelling efficiently, helped by the display of place names at the beginning of each scene explaining which castle we’re at now, as well as how it was known in 900-something, and the name it goes by now. If you like that kind of nerdy attention to detail, you will love this – the saga must be essential viewing for Larp enthusiasts and battle recreators. But, Bazalgette and the film never wink at us, and try to stay true to the mindset of the times, from self-hating gay men who try to purge the “sins” they fear they’ve committed by waging war for Christianity, to the way Dark Age folks treated women and conquered enemies with about an equal amount of contempt. The battle scenes are not quite on the scale of the Lord of the Rings or Game of Thrones franchises, but they are pretty spicy and well staged for something that clearly has a far smaller budget. The Last Kingdom: Seven Kings Must Die is released on 14 April on Netflix."
Raging Bull review – still packs a punch like no boxing movie before or since,"Scorsese’s brutally nihilist biopic of the self-hating, self-sabotaging middleweight champion remains full of despairing beauty and unforgettable performances",5,"No matter how many times I see it, I know its hardest punch is coming at the very end and I am helplessly leading with my chin. Director Martin Scorsese flashes up a quotation from John 9:24-26, its verses individually illuminated in succession: “So for the second time, the Pharisees summoned the man who had been blind and said: / ‘Speak the truth before God. We know this fellow is a sinner.’ / ‘Whether or not he is a sinner, I do not know,’ the man replied / ‘All I know is this: once I was blind and now I can see.’”But has redemption really finally come for Jake LaMotta – the corrupt, self-hating, self-sabotaging and not especially repentant boxer so unforgettably played by Robert De Niro in Scorsese’s 1980 classic Raging Bull, incandescent with monochrome beauty. LaMotta ends his days without reconciliation with his wife whom he abused, without reconciliation with his longsuffering brother Joey (an equally unforgettable performance from Joe Pesci). The final act comes with his blandly sentimental, self-congratulatory nightclub act in which this bloated, ruined figure is simply pleased to have survived, as uninterested in moral judgment as the blind man who refuses to condemn Jesus.Perhaps that is the mystery of Raging Bull: its equivalent of divine grace. The boxing movie is traditionally about redemption and the comeback of the underdog; just the year before, Stallone’s Rocky II – produced, like Ragjng Bull, by Irwin Winkler – told just this kind of story. But Raging Bull was a more brutally nihilist tale, its subject a brawling, misogynist fighter who took a dive for the short end money (like Brando in On the Waterfront), whose championship win was hopelessly compromised by mob corruption, whose decline was marked by ingratitude and abuse, and who finally becomes a caged monster punching the wall with despair. (Moviegoers at the time sensed an echo with David Lynch’s The Elephant Man.) And all this is shown in a stunning, dreamlike series of episodes in and out of the ring, as LaMotta fanatically squares up to various opponents, has head-butting encounters with Joey, falls in love with his second wife, Vickie, (Cathy Moriarty) – and comes to hate her, driven mad by his own possessive fear and insecurity and brought down by his own toxic machismo.As well as being based on LaMotta’s autobiography, Scorsese’s film took inspiration from Mark Robson’s Champion (1949) with Kirk Douglas, and Jean-Pierre Melville’s Magnet of Doom (1963) with Jean-Paul Belmondo. But the sheer brio and kinetic energy of those nightmarish boxing scenes are utterly unique, like no boxing movie before or since. Maybe the sport itself was outclassed by this film’s despairing beauty.The “dive” scene is at the very centre of the film’s meaning. LaMotta, like so many fighters before him, has to deliberately throw a fight so that the mob grandees, who have bet heavily on his unfancied opponent at long odds, will win big and reward him with a shot at the title. But it is a desperately risky business: the promised title shot may not materialise and his career momentum might stall, ending in the Palookaville of defeat: which is of course Brando’s sad fate in On the Waterfront. De Niro shows how LaMotta’s pride will not let him lose convincingly; he can’t and won’t go down. The crowd jeers at this obvious corruption and in his dressing room LaMotta bursts into tears like a little boy. But that is the point: in the emotional ritual of abuse, LaMotta has to be humiliated, mutilated like a gelding, shown who’s boss, and bend the knee to his mob bosses. This is masculinity’s theatre of cruelty.When I first saw Raging Bull, I came out of the cinema simultaneously exhausted and yet supercharged with energy, as if I could throw buses across the street. It still makes me feel like that. Raging Bull is released on 14 April in UK cinemas, and screening now in select Australian cinemas."
Assassin Club review – trashy hitman runaround is generic multiplex filler,"Our nice-guy killer is entered into a hitpersons’ Champions League, destined to fulfil functional combat scenes and voice the most leaden dialogue ever transmitted in Dolby surround",2,"Some films don’t globetrot so much as globelurch, steered by creatives going wild on Expedia after a heavy night on the Kestrel. Pinging haphazardly and often nonsensically around central and eastern Europe, this trashy runaround sees French action specialist Camille Delamarre (Brick Mansions, The Transporter Refuelled) emerging from sometime mentor Luc Besson’s shadow, for better or worse. Liberated from Besson’s more questionable fetishes but also untethered from a healthy line of credit, the result never rises above generic multiplex filler. Everyone is travelling economy, with a tatty script stuffed way down, out of shame, in their carry-on luggage.After doing for an assailant who attacks him and his schoolmarm girlfriend, nice-guy assassin Morgan (Henry Golding) learns he’s been unknowingly entered in effectively a hitpersons’ Champions League. On the plus side, it provides the perfect opportunity to deploy the improbably wide-ranging personal surveillance network he maintains from his shabby digs. Sam Neill is Morgan’s urbane handler, found tickling the harpsichord at one point; Noomi Rapace occupies a botched dual role, requiring her to alternate between big specs as the head of some security agency and blond frosting as the most vicious of Morgan’s rivals. The casting is simpler elsewhere: grizzled ex-doormen abound.The action is functional enough, even as it abides by combat principles worn out by the later Bourne movies. The obvious limitation is that Delamarre remains baffled by any scene that doesn’t involve guns, cars or fisticuffs; his best guess is to screw in eight gaudy lightbulbs, go handheld and hope his actors can rescue him. They, however, are preoccupied with some of the most leaden dialogue ever transmitted in Dolby surround. No attention whatsoever has been paid to the detail: the fingers severed to confirm kills have all the solidity of Percy Pigs, while one website headline looks like it was knocked out on the Notes app 30 seconds before camera rolled. Appreciation for the artistry of the John Wick series redoubles frame by crummy frame. Assassin Club is released on 14 April in cinemas."
Godland review – beauty and terror in magnificent study of church-building priest,Hlynur Pálmason’s fictional account of a Danish pastor sent to Iceland in the 19th century is superb in its compositions and nuanced depictions of hostility,5,"Harshness is transformed into beauty and then terror by this extraordinary film from Icelandic director Hlynur Pálmason about a 19th-century Danish pastor sent to establish a new church on Iceland’s remote south-eastern coast. I left the cinema dazed and elated by its artistry; it is breathtaking in its epic scale, magnificent in its comprehension of landscape, piercingly uncomfortable in its human intimacy and severity. There is such superb compositional sense in the still life tableau shots and the almost archaeological sense of time, creating something deeply mysterious and unbearably sad. There are echoes of Werner Herzog’s Aguirre, the Wrath of God, Roland Joffé’s The Mission, Lisandro Alonso’s Jauja – and even Howard Hawks’s Red River.Pálmason announces in the opening credits that the story was inspired by the supposed discovery in Iceland of seven glass-plate photographs of people and places taken there at the end of the 19th century. While the claim is a deadpan fiction, his screen has an almost square 1.33:1 aspect ratio, perhaps in honour of the still photograph motif. This smaller-size, in such contradistinction to the movie’s CinemaScope ambition and spectacle, gives a density to the viewing experience.Elliott Crosset Hove plays Lucas, a highly-strung young clergyman instructed by his bishop to travel to a pioneer community in Iceland (then a Danish dependency), superintend the church-building and install himself as parish priest. Lucas makes this arduous journey first by sea and then overland with horses, taking among his luggage a huge and burdensome cross, climbing mountains and fording rivers with it. But Lucas has a secular-ethnographic project to go with the imperial Christian mission: he dreams of taking the first pictures there, capturing the people with new technology. His cumbersome tripod goes on his back, its three spiked feet poking up behind his head, a version of the points of a crucifix. The camera is Lucas’s ordeal as he visits his stations of the cross.Driven to the edge of madness by hardship and physical pain, Lucas has a thwarted friendship – or something more – with his translator (Hilmar Gudjónsson), and finally finds an erotic connection with Anna (Vic Carmen Sonne), the daughter of the local parishioner, who takes him in. But his life is dominated by his cantankerous, contemptuous Icelandic guide Ragnar, a tough, weatherbeaten veteran tremendously played by Ingvar Sigurdsson, the cop from Pálmason’s previous film A White, White Day. Palmasón shows that Lucas is humanised and possibly even redeemed by his encounters at journey’s end, particularly his relationship with his quasi-host, the level-headed widower Carl (a shrewdly judged performance from Jacob Lohmann), who is bemused by Lucas’s self-harming decision to come to Iceland in the most difficult way possible, and then suspicious of his potential designs on his eldest daughter. Anna’s younger sister Ida (Ída Mekkín Hlynsdóttir) has an attractively emollient role and her relationship with Lucas is gentle and sweet and brings out the nearest Lucas has to warmth.The film’s mightiest figure is the implacable Ragnar. Far from helping Lucas across the terrain, Ragnar embodies it; he is the very personification of its hostility. As an Icelander, he hates the high-handed Dane with his book-learning. Lucas comes in turn to hate and fear him. And yet Pálmason shows that Ragnar softens imperceptibly even as he sabotages Lucas; he needs someone to confess his terror of God to while exorcising a lifetime of buried rage. In Godland, these emotions are projected out on to the stunning, daunting landscape to the accompaniment of spine-meltingly beautiful choral music.

Superman review – Christopher Reeve’s superhero origin movie still looks swell,"Richard Donner’s 1978 event movie brought Hollywood grandeur, a great John Williams score and a gentlemanly hero quite unlike any other",5,"When Richard Donner’s Superman was first released in 1978, getting audiences to believe a man could fly didn’t just mean state-of-the-art special effects – and these don’t hold up too badly even now. It meant convincing them that superhero films were worthwhile in the first place; it meant event-movie seriousness, a great John Williams score and opening intergalactic credits that were a little like the recent smash Star Wars; it meant Hollywood grandeur and acting nobility, a film that began looking like a weighty action thriller with substantial comedy moments, a disaster movie, or rather averted-disaster movie, giving us a tremendous shot of the San Andreas fault opening up, and a supernatural time-travel drama.Superman is a very 1970s New York film, with some great, bustling streetscape scenes, and the film is shot and lit in a familiar realist way quite different from the hard, flat, unreal colour and production design of Marvel or DC films now. It was the great origin myth movie, the origin myth for superhero movies themselves, the product that now dominates cinema. And for this film, the “extended universe” was the actual universe, our universe: a standalone drama with Superman at its centre, and bad guys lined up ready to be fought.Mario Puzo claimed he was paid a million dollars simply for drafting a page-long story synopsis; a snowy-haired, Shakespearean-voiced Marlon Brando plays the Man of Steel’s tragic father Jor-El who warns his home planet Krypton of the impending climate crisis, in vain. Susannah York is his all-but silent mother – and no less a figure than Trevor Howard plays one of the Krypton worthies who ignores the warning. Jor-El’s baby is dispatched to our human planet, crashing to Earth in the farm belt in 1938. His teen angst years are given short shrift and after a kind of quasi-timeless existential coming-of-age in the icy Fortress of Solitude, he is somehow given his famous costume and moves to Metropolis in 1978 as mild-mannered reporter Clark Kent.And so begins the most famous example of UST, or Unresolved Sexual Tension, in screenwriting history: endlessly flirting with reporter Lois Lane (Margot Kidder), a smoker of Marlboro cigarettes who after a date-slash-exclusive-interview wonderingly gives him his name: “What a super man … Superman!” So nothing to do with Nietzsche. Gene Hackman is a tremendous Lex Luthor: the wisecracking villain and acting heavyweight that Superman deserved.Christopher Reeve endowed Superman/Clark with a goofy seriousness and reticent, gentlemanly charm, a family movie hero quite different and more mature than the sleeker, cooler, younger figure that pretty much everyone since has tried to portray; Reeve dons a big and unsexy pair of glasses to match those worn by snooker legend Dennis Taylor. The actor’s own catastrophic accident in 1995, which resulted in him becoming a wheelchair user, gave the likable Reeve his own poignantly mythic, extratextual part of the Superman legend.This Superman alludes explicitly to its origins in the Depression-era comics, and Clark has a quaint 30s habit of using the phrase “Swell!” from his boyhood. Maybe now this movie looks quaint in the same way. But there’s still a surge of adventure and fun. Superman is released on 7 April in cinemas."
Ride On review – Jackie Chan and kung fu horse gallop through dustup greatest hits,"Red Hare, a horse that makes the actors look like chicken-legged weaklings, helps pull the emotional strings in this maudlin going over of old ground",3,"Old warhorse Jackie Chan, who still has a heap of movies in development, doesn’t look ready for the knacker’s yard quite yet. But that’s not the impression given by this valedictory-seeming and downright maudlin family action film, with its refrain of “Jumping down is easy, stepping down is hard”. Playing a one-time master Hong Kong stuntman who has been laid low by injury, Chan is seen watching reels of his classic spills – including the iconic Police Story shopping mall plunge – with all the misty-eyed reverence of Cinema Paradiso.Ride On lays it on doubly thick: not only is Master Luo (Chan) partnered with Red Hare, a cute horse who all but talks, he is also rebuilding his relationship with estranged daughter Bao (Liu Haocun). Scraping a living by giving rides in comedy outfits to tourists outside movie studios, Luo and Red Hare are called back to stunt work when video of them tag-teaming some local debt collectors hits social media. Bao, still resentful of her dad for prioritising his career, agrees to become his agent. But the comeback is threatened when a pair of corporate goons turn up to auction off Red Hare, apparently someone else’s property.The 68-year-old Chan slips down off Red Hare like a limber teenager. But horse aside, he largely retreads old ground here, with a handful of shambolic dustups that, apart from the enterprising use of a wicker rocking chair, are pretty standard Jackie. Only one kung fu set piece really stands out: Luo and sidekick triumphantly face off against an axe-wielding horde for the movie cameras. Red Hare batters a thug-filled tram car with titanic kicks that make human performers, Chan included, look like chicken-legged weaklings.Bao’s lawyer boyfriend (Guo Qilin) offers a way out of the bailiff predicament, with the bumbling suitor opening up some old-school social farce, including a callback to Drunken Master’s training sequence. But this plotline and the drawn-out, drippy reconciliation with Bao are non-starters. It’s all there as dressing, along with a late appearance from current Chinese box-office don Wu Jing, for an overlong ceremonial send-off for Chan and the rough’n’tumble Hong Kong tradition. Chan has accrued so much goodwill, though, it’s hard not to be tearjerked into submission – especially with his sentimental proxy Red Hare cranking up the hankie count. When Chan finally does retire, we’ll all need our own emotional support animal. Ride On is released in cinemas on 7 April."
Three Colours: White review – Kieślowski’s expert black comedy of gangster capitalism,The middle film in the Colours trilogy features Julie Delpy as it takes a dagger to both France and Poland’s conception of equality and meritocracy,5,"This is the second movie in Krzystztof Kieślowski’s great Colours trilogy, now on rerelease; here white is the colour of death, the colour of winter, the colour of orgasm (a climactic, screen-filling flash of pleasure) and also the colour of a clean slate and a fresh start about to be muddied and spoiled. Theoretically, it addresses not just the middle colour of the French flag, but the second tenet of the revolution as well – equality – which it does by dramatising some outrageous inequality. It also satirises the specious new equality and meritocracy of gangster capitalism, on the rise in post-Soviet Poland.Working again with composer Zbigniew Preisner, Kieślowski audaciously jolts the tone away from the dreamy, tragic and cosmic loneliness of Blue (whose protagonist, Juliette Binoche, is glimpsed again here) to a vinegary black comedy of marital breakdown, poverty and immigrant anxiety; it also contains one of the biggest, bleakest laugh lines in European cinema. Karol, the poverty-stricken Polish hairdresser in Paris has no money or passport, and finds he can only get back to Poland by stowing away in a trunk belonging to a Polish acquaintance. In Warsaw, this expensive-looking trunk is stolen by crooked baggage handlers who are furious to find only a homeless man inside. After being savagely beaten, Karol looks around at a snowy-white rubbish dump and gasps: “Home at last!” No one could accuse Kieślowski of romanticising his homeland.Zbigniew Zamachowski plays Karol; his marriage to Dominique, acted with glacial hauteur by Julie Delpy, has ended in divorce due to non-consummation, with Karol’s erectile dysfunction mirroring the dysfunction all around him. Apparently exploiting her advantage as a French citizen against the alien Pole, Dominique vengefully freezes their bank account and even torches their hair salon, threatening to blame the arson on him. Hapless Karol is befriended by a lugubrious and melancholy fellow Pole, Mikołaj (Janusz Gajos) who leads him back to Poland and makes him a bizarre financial offer to get him back on his feet.Back in the old country, Karol finds himself working for black market money-changers. He gets wind of western corporations intending to buy up valueless land thereabouts, moves like lightning to buy the land with Mikolaj’s cash and becomes a slick-haired capitalist himself, all the time dreaming of one day proving himself to Dominique with his new financial virility.It’s an almost Jonsonian parable of an upwardly mobile hero with a downwardly mobile view on life: busking in the Paris metro, stowing away in luggage in the hold of a plane and becoming a shark-like entrepreneur wheeling and dealing in the new Polish business environment. Zamachowski’s sad, boyish performance is a droll counterpart to the worldly Mikołaj, a mysterious professional card player, wonderfully played by stage veteran Gajos. As for Dominique, it is a bit of a two-dimensional role (certainly compared to Binoche’s in the previous picture) and a rather male conception of villainous sexiness, but Delpy carries it off with panache.What a strange confection White is – an opera of male agony and outrageously implausible picaresque adventure. Yet it succeeds amazingly on its own melodramatic terms.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotion Three Colours White is released on 7 April in cinemas."
Dungeons & Dragons: Honour Among Thieves review – riotously enjoyable fantasy adventure,"More than just a reboot, this new chapter in the role-playing game franchise is a wonderful piece of world-building",4,"Well, this is refreshing. Dungeons & Dragons: Honour Among Thieves is that vanishingly rare entity – a riotously entertaining family-friendly film that hasn’t been painfully squeezed out of a comic-book franchise like the last, forlorn dregs of toothpaste from a long-dead tube. Admittedly, this isn’t the first film to be based on the enduringly popular fantasy role-playing game – Jeremy Irons starred in a critically reviled version in 2000; a made-for-TV sequel and direct-to-DVD third instalment followed. But Honour Among Thieves is more than a reboot – it’s a fleshed-out, multidimensional piece of world-building, with immediately likable characters, plenty of face-crunching, axe-based fight choreography and a running joke about potatoes.Kudos to John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein, who co-wrote and co-directed the picture. As a creative partnership, they have experience in reboots – they co-wrote Spider-Man: Homecoming – and board games, having co-directed the comedy thriller Game Night. With this picture, they strike a satisfying balance between character and action, and ensure that the digital effects are in service of the story, rather than the other way around.It also helps that the film is exceptionally well cast. Chris Pine’s charm has never been more slippery as incorrigible thief Edgin and Michelle Rodriguez brings formidable action chops to Edgin’s partner in crime Holga. Bridgerton’s Regé-Jean Page bags the best lines and much of the action as Xenk. And then there’s Hugh Grant, whose roguish conman Forge bears more than a passing resemblance to his Phoenix Buchanan in Paddington 2. But when the film is this much fun, who cares if Grant recycles some of the greatest hits from his gag repertoire?"
Seaside Special review – a heartfelt time capsule of Brexit-divided Britain,"Jens Meurer’s film, beautifully shot in the summer of 2019 in Cromer on the Norfolk coast, is refreshingly free of cynicism",4,"German filmmaker Jens Meurer has had a huge success in his native land with this vivid and richly affectionate anglophile documentary. I think I can see why, and it could even turn into a German national TV tradition – like Dinner for One, the English-language drawing room comedy sketch that the Germans love watching at Christmas. Could it be that a German documentary about an English seaside town will show us all the way ahead, and heal the psychic wounds of Brexit?Seaside Special is all about Cromer on the north Norfolk coast in the distant summer of 2019 – and mostly about all the local people preparing to take part in the annual end-of-the-pier show, the last of its kind in the UK, or for that matter the world. This theatrical event itself looks like a terrifically enjoyable variety gang show: with naughty gags, brassy musical numbers, Hollywood homages and pop songs. It is a bit like the BBC’s 70s programme Seaside Special (does Meurer really know about that?) or the old kids’ TV show Crackerjack.Cromer, as Meurer’s film is quick to tell us, was overwhelmingly for Brexit but, interestingly, the tone of his film isn’t condescending or derogatory – perhaps because, to Germans, the leavers and the remainers both look like wacky Pythonesque British eccentrics. Meurer interviews leavers includer a fisher who we see bobbing thoughtfully about in his boat, just next to the pier, explaining why he’s against the EU. Then we talk to some of the showbusiness folk who are broadly in favour of staying. But they have no ill-will towards neighbours who feel differently. People talk animatedly about feeling European and also feeling British, and it doesn’t occur to anyone to start a fight about it.There is always a kind of rackety glamour and melancholy in the end-of-the-pier idea, and at times this reminds me, just a bit, of Ken Russell’s The Boy Friend. I suspect, though, a British feature film or documentary on the same subject would have opted for miserablism and found an end-of-the-pier show that was just about to close down for ever. Meurer has instead found a show that is a big success, in rude commercial health and doing its bit to keep Brexit Britain together.Seaside Special is a time capsule for that almost forgotten era: after the Brexit vote, but before Covid, when the nation was convulsed by daily headlines about hard Brexit, soft Brexit, leaving with a deal, leaving without a deal, and whether or not Theresa May was a more impressive politician than Boris Johnson. The show goes on and the politicians’ incompetence is resolutely ignored. There are some Johnson fans here, of course, and the show itself is a little like Boris, only without the cynicism and mendacity.There is a strange and heartbreakingly sad footnote: standup comic Paul Eastwood, a cruise-ship veteran and Cromer show regular who was hugely loved by the audiences here, and sometimes shown in sad-clown mode pensively smoking, died in an accident just after this film was made.When the cast perform their heartfelt rendition of We’re Off to See the Wizard from The Wizard of Oz followed by Daft Punk’s Get Lucky, it is unironically brilliant. The Cromer end-of-the-pier show should run all year: maybe they can do a residency in Hamburg.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotion Seaside Special screened on 16 April at Riverside, Woodbridge and on 17 May at the Flatpack festival, Birmingham; it is released on 10 November in UK and Irish cinemas."
Murder Mystery 2 review – Netflix sequel needs more murder and mystery,Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston lift a lazy follow-up to their action-heavy Netflix comedy with genuine movie star charm,3,"The curious wrestle between pratfalls and pathos that’s made Adam Sandler’s career so increasingly fascinating has erred toward a win for the latter with age. The aggressive forgettability of his early Netflix deal output slowly faded into something more worthwhile with last year’s surprisingly textured basketball drama Hustle and simultaneously, we’ve seen the Safdies squeeze out his best work in Uncut Gems (the trio will collaborate again with a new film set in the world of sports memorabilia) and later this year he’ll star alongside Carey Mulligan in the offbeat sci-fi drama Spaceman. While a total ban on fart jokes is unlikely (he’s also set to star in a new Netflix comedy from the director of The Wrong Missy), his 10 for them, one for me ethos is definitely shifting.Murder Mystery, his most watched Netflix film to date was one that didn’t exactly straddle these two halves but made for a more acceptable use of his sillier side, thanks greatly to the appearance of Jennifer Aniston. It was a breezy action comedy about a wannabe detective couple trying to solve a murder while on vacation, a low-stakes Friday night watch with medium rewards. The same could be said about the totally adequate follow-up out this week, so similar in every way that it feels as if we’ve just clicked “play next episode”.In a post-Poker Face world (a throwback hour-long mystery-of-the-week show I have slight issues with but skillfully leaps through whodunnit beats with speed), this often feels like it would be better suited to a TV format as well, a simple script inelegantly stretched. The credits roll here before we’ve even reached the 80-minute mark but even that starts to feel padded, car chases and explosions serving to distract us from a murder mystery that’s criminally short on both.This time, the couple is headed to an extravagant destination wedding (the film does, at the very least, boast multiple, non-green-screened locations, a genuine treat in the streaming era) to celebrate their friend Vikram (a returning Adeel Akhtar) and his marriage to a Parisian shopgirl-done-good (the ever-charming Mélanie Laurent). But, to their slight relief, chaos cuts things short with a murder and a kidnap, forcing them both on a brief adventure.In the first outing, Sandler’s cop and Aniston’s hairdresser were desperate to be detectives and in the second, they’ve progressed somewhat to become unlicensed ones, flubbing their way through fourth-rate jobs involving potential cheating spouses. There’s something interestingly amoral about their opportunistic glee over a violent murder happening in front of them and how it might improve their careers and marriage but it’s also interestingly unexplored, returning screenwriter James Vanderbilt not wanting to make them anything other than extremely easy-to-like. The mystery they become entangled with isn’t really tangled enough, with a short suspect list (including Jodie Turner-Smith’s bitchy countess and Mark Strong’s super-detective) and a tired ransom plot that relies more on passable action set pieces than any real twists or suspense (the finale in particular is all flash and very little else).It’s made just-about-watchable by Sandler and Aniston again, whose combined movie star charm proves magnetic enough to carry us through the flatter moments, both nailing some effectively chaotic physical comedy and maintaining a warm, relaxed chemistry. It might not give Sandler the sort of latter-day challenge we now know he can handle so well but it’s an easy win for the pair and for Netflix, the film sure to be another much-watched and endlessly followed-up sequel. I just wish the script had made things a little harder for them and for us, a murder mystery to be solved with eyes closed and watched with eyes elsewhere.Murder Mystery 2 is now available on Netflix"
Lewis Capaldi: How I’m Feeling Now review – self-aware star struggling with weight of expectation,"While some of this documentary following the making of the Scottish songwriter’s second album falls into cliched soul-baring territory, Capaldi’s wit and talent shine through",3,"‘A global pandemic is only in the top three weird things that have happened to me in the last three years,” Lewis Capaldi notes at the start of this generically made but nonetheless startling Netflix documentary about his rise. After years strumming in Scottish pubs and clubs, his raw piano ballad Bruises went viral and lift-off was vertical: his debut album became the biggest seller in the UK in both 2019 and 2020, and its single Someone You Loved, a seven-week chart topper in the UK, made him the first Scottish solo artist to reach US No 1 since Sheena Easton in 1981. An endearing goofball on social media, Capaldi won even more fans by puncturing influencer culture with his blithely unglamorous image, but his japes disguised a man suffering from terrible anxiety, panic attacks and a shoulder twitch that would later be diagnosed as a Tourette’s symptom.These highs and lows are documented by Joe Pearlman, using the same televised-therapy approach he used to great effect for his film Bros: After the Screaming Stops. He follows Capaldi, now massively famous, to a studio in his Whitburn family home where he starts work on his second album. There’s a flash of typical Capaldi wit as he’s recognised by a woman sat in an optician’s far across the street: “You’re cured!”Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Billie Eilish and George Ezra are among the singers who have by now made this kind of soul-baring shaky-cam documentary into a cliche; in a social media age, pop stars must broadcast their trauma to stay relatable rather than keep it to themselves, and so they might as well do it on their own terms. Capaldi is alive to how constructed everything is, telling Pearlman he can finish a scene of him packing for an LA trip with a shot of a plane flying overhead – which Pearlman then does.It’s an amusing moment, but Pearlman isn’t always self-aware. At one of Capaldi’s lowest ebbs, his shoulder twitches violently and he puts his head in his hands as he talks desperately about his hopes for the new album. Pearlman follows up with jump-scare edits of screaming fans soundtracked with screeching ambient noise, a tacky and emotionally manipulative choice for a moment that should be calm, and dignifying Capaldi.Nevertheless, Pearlman clearly does put Capaldi, his family and his sizeable supporting cast of pals and industry bods at ease, resulting in some astonishingly frank scenes. It may be that his manager Ryan Walter is generally a supportive colleague and astute businessman, but not on the basis of a horrible exchange here, as Capaldi plays him a new song. Walter’s first question: “Is it a hit single?” Musical director Aiden Halliday looks at him like he’s defecated on his car bonnet. Capaldi worries the new one is bit similar to Someone You Loved. “And what? That’s a good thing ... people love stuff that sounds the same as it,” Walter says consolingly, the risk-averse, creatively-redundant major label mindset defined. But it gets worse still, as Walter warns Capaldi: “I’ve definitely put all my eggs in one basket ... and [if you] fuck it up ...” As a whole retinue of people realise how much money they can make, Pearlman shows the atmosphere of expectation that forms a dark cloud over Capaldi.Thankfully, even when Capaldi is surrounded and cowed by bronzed executives, you know he has the talent and emotional acuity of an artist, qualities these industry functionaries can’t really grasp. His overlords have sent him to LA to write with two very capable songwriters in Dan Nigro and Amy Allen, but this is shit-at-a-wall creativity and Capaldi, who wrote Someone You Loved on his own in his parents’ house, knows it: “It just doesn’t work like that … Do I even know what I like, now?”That second album is coming out in May and the six-man co-write of lead single Forget Me suggests Capaldi didn’t exactly go back to first principles. But towards the end of the film he is shown launching the single – soon another No 1 – in high spirits, in between working out and eating microwaveable plastic containers of green veg. Pearlman shows that Capaldi has become even more of a celebrity cliche, the star who’s been on a journey and come out the other side – but you imagine Capaldi, with his indefatigable wryness, is all too aware of that. Lewis Capaldi: How I’m Feeling Now is released on 5 April on Netflix."
Drømmeland review – hermit and his smartphone in the Norwegian wilderness,This voyeuristic account of an eccentric who broadcasts himself hunting naked never meaningfully addresses his paradoxical existence,2,"Having resolved to extricate himself from the chains of civilisation, Nils Leidal has taken solitary refuge among the mountains of Norway. While his basically furnished shed and daily rituals of scavenging and ice baths hark back to a simpler way of life, the sixtysomething is also glued to his internet-connected smartphone. The paradox is beguiling: how does one maintain a philosophy of self-sufficiency while simultaneously broadcasting his existence online?Unfocused in its structure, Joost van der Wiel’s muddled documentary grapples with these fascinating contradictions on a superficial level. Apart from Nils’ vague distrust of the government, as evidenced in a video in which he burns his passport, the film offers little information about his background or the reasons behind his self-imposed exile. Punctuated by nondescript drone shots of the beautiful landscape, Drømmeland is mostly preoccupied with Nils’ more eccentric behaviour, like his rueful moaning to a lover on the phone, or his habit of hunting in the nude. Haphazardly edited with little consideration for his state of mind, these sequences come off as voyeuristic or plain strange.In stark contrast to Lizzie MacKenzie’s affecting The Hermit of Treig, which portrayed the life of a recluse with vivid intimacy, Drømmeland gawks at its subject instead of meaningfully connecting with his unusual reality. The most dynamic confrontation occurs when police officers knock on Nils’ door to inquire about the death of his beloved horse, a reminder of the far-reaching power of state surveillance. These moments of interest, however, are few and far between; Drømmeland just doesn’t cohere into a perceptive look at the dilemmas that come with retreating from modern society. Drømmeland is available from 31 March on True Story."
The Cow Who Sang a Song Into the Future review – heady Chilean eco fantasy,River pollution is the spur for debut director Francisca Alegría’s atmospheric Spanish-language fable with nature at its heart,3,"Blending science fiction and magical realism, environmental catastrophe and family secrets, Francisca Alegría’s heady mystery is an ambitious and murkily atmospheric debut. Set in Chile, this Spanish-language picture takes a real-life event – the pollution of a river by a paper mill – as a jumping-off point. The disaster kills fish and wildlife, but it reanimates Magdalena (Mía Maestro), who drowned in the river many years before. Mute, Magdalena now communicates through digital technology. The tech-fantasy crossover has a kinship with the recent Neptune Frost, but most of all this film about motherhood and natural balance has unexpected parallels with Andrea Arnold’s Cow."
1976 review – compelling drama of privilege and dissent in Pinochet’s Chile,Aline Küppenheim excels as a bourgeois housewife whose eyes are opened to the true cost of life in a military dictatorship,4,"The impressive feature debut from actor turned director Manuela Martelli, 1976 is an elegantly circumspect Spanish-language drama set against the backdrop of Pinochet-era Chile. Carmen (Aline Küppenheim) is a chic older woman whose marriage to a doctor has afforded her an enviably sheltered lifestyle. Her primary concern when we meet her is choosing exactly the right paint colour for the renovations on her summer home. But then the local priest persuades her to care for a wounded radical, Elías (Nicolás Sepúlveda), and Carmen starts to realise just how dangerous her country is for those who dare to disagree with its leaders.Küppenheim is terrific, her precision and restraint in the role drawing us into the story. Mariá Portugal’s analogue electronic score is eerily atmospheric. And a recurring motif of shoes reminds us of the importance of toeing the Pinochet line."
John Wick: Chapter 4 review – enjoyably pulpy slaughterfest,"If the plot of the latest John Wick outing offers no surprises, the stunts are mind-boggling, and Donnie Yen and Scott Adkins are fun new faces",4,"You expect that the stunts and fight choreography of a John Wick film will be top tier. The director, former kickboxer Chad Stahelski, got his start in the movie industry as a stuntman after all, serving as Keanu Reeves’s stunt double in The Matrix. Extravagantly showy stunt work is a given, and it’s the main reason to watch these enjoyably pulpy slaughterfests – certainly more so than the plot, which reprises the basic structure of past films, with Wick (Keanu Reeves) slicing his way through the countless henchmen of his former employers, the High Table. But even by the standards of the past Wick outings, this is remarkable. Human bodies are hurled into moving vehicles; Reeves’s double tumbles down the entire length of the Sacré-Coeur stairs. And, just to remind us that we are in the hands of an action master, Stahelski delivers one extended, mind-bogglingly complicated fight sequence in what appears to be a single shot, the camera floating overhead.Stahelski reteams with key crew, including production designer Kevin Kavanaugh, who retains his fondness for neon tube structures and colour coding. But there’s fresh blood in the cast, most notably a deliciously insouciant Donnie Yen, as blind assassin Caine, and Scott Adkins, who is enormous fun as Killa, a murderous plus-sized German equipped with metal teeth, all the better for chewing the scenery."
Antidote review – ayahuasca tourism film lauds hallucinogenic tea’s healing powers,Is the vogue for the Amazonian drink a beneficial driver of tourism – or a form of capitalist exploitation? This film lacks the rigour to find out,2,"Often mocked by standup comedians and sitcom writers – a sure sign of its ubiquity – ayahuasca, the hallucinogenic tea, has brought an influx of western travellers going on healing retreats to the forests of Peru. Focusing on its medicinal properties, Marc Silver’s documentary aims to dispel certain misconceptions about the psychedelic brew.Among Indigenous people, rituals involving ayahuasca have been practised for millennia. Made from vines and other plant extracts, the concoction relieves patients of physical and mental traumas. The cure also carries a ceremonial aspect; the taking of the medicine is at times accompanied by songs and chants.Once deemed satanic by Catholic missionaries during colonial times, ayahuasca ironically now finds new converts among foreigners, whose vivid testimonials of their powerful hallucinations are recounted in detail. Nevertheless, this film seems either unwilling or ill-equipped to tackle the thornier aspects of the ayahuasca tourism boom. For example, what is the material relationship between the local community and the organisers of these wellness residencies? As well as assuming the role of a guiding force during ayahuasca ceremonies, Indigenous people also provide the meals and accommodation. Is this labour fairly compensated?Furthermore, the film touches on the environmental threat of oil companies encroaching on Indigenous land yet neglects to examine the sustainability of ayahuasca tourism. Could it in fact be another form of capitalist exploitation and extraction of natural resources masquerading as wellness?Though commendable in its attempt to understand ayahuasca as a legitimate and effective form of alternative medicine, Antidote suffers from a lack of intellectual rigour that leaves the final product seeming like a glossy travel brochure. Antidote is released on 24 March in cinemas"
Dreaming an Island review – an eerie tour of planet Earth’s depopulated future,"This documentary about a small Japanese island, a once thriving mining outpost that now has only 100 residents, lightens its existential concerns with a focus on human connection",3,"In his second full-length documentary, Swiss director Andrea Pellerani gives us a guided tour of what a post-industrial, post-growth, or even an eerily post-human future might look like. We are on the south-western Japanese island of Ikeshima. Once a thriving mining outpost that was home to 8,000 people, since the facility’s closure in 2001 it has been reduced to just 100 mostly elderly holdouts. As the residents fish the grey sea off abandoned wharves, inspect pregnant cats and loiter around derelict lots, there is a sense they inhabit the set of a long-shuttered stage play, and are awaiting new lines.Though it begins with long tracking shots of greenery choking empty apartment blocks, Dreaming an Island isn’t exactly ruin porn. Pellerani is more interested in the vestiges of human activity, and milks a distinct absurdity from the stalwart locals. One collects “fun” beach flotsam, there are guides waiting rather optimistically for an upswing in coal-mining tourism, while Ikeshima’s sole restaurateur hopes for a customer. “Is there anything interesting to see?” asks one who finally turns up. “In what sense interesting?” she replies.The existential quotient spikes in the sections at the island’s school, where 11 teachers cater to just two pupils. A tutor has one of them running sprint drills out on the training field, preparing for some hypothetical athletics meet.No doubt because it’s inherent to the subject matter, Ikeshima’s stasis makes it tricky for Pellerani to find dramatic through-lines; filling even 76 minutes feels like a struggle. Ikeshima is a canary in the coalmine for Japan, which, with its plummeting birth rate and stagnant economy, is often itself talked up as a canary for the rest of the developed world. But if this wan afterlife really is our future, then Pellerani also emphasises a dutiful bravery in affirming old ways and believing they can be renewed. In a peppy coda, children and teachers arrive at an old people’s home to present them with artwork, play darts and sing old-time ditties. Mines can be exhausted but human connection endures in this fond not-quite-swansong. Dreaming an Island is available on True Story from 24 March"
Allelujah review – starry but jarring film of Alan Bennett’s hospital play,"Judi Dench, Jennifer Saunders, Derek Jacobi star in this faithful yet uneven adaptation",2,"Adapted by Call the Midwife creator Heidi Thomas from the 2018 play by Alan Bennett, set in a geriatric hospital unit in Yorkshire populated by lovable eccentrics and starring a formidable selection of seasoned British acting talent (Judi Dench, Jennifer Saunders, David Bradley and Derek Jacobi star), Allelujah should be a slam dunk of a crowd-pleaser. Unfortunately, Richard Eyre’s film is jarringly uneven: such a collision of tones and conflicting messages that it undermines its own earnest coda in support of the NHS.The hospital is threatened by penny-pinching government officials. The medical staff struggle on, undaunted. But what seems to be a stirring tale of a community standing up against the powers that be takes a darker turn as the story swerves unexpectedly – and rather clumsily – into thriller territory."
Their Algeria review – sixtysomethings separate in meditation on immigrant family life,French Algerian documentary-maker Lina Soualem interviews her grandparents about their marriage and the 1950s immigrant experience in this touching film,3,"A tender tribute to her Algerian grandparents, who emigrated to the French medieval town of Thiers in the 1950s, Lina Soualem’s touching documentary shows how the act of filming can awaken memories that have long laid dormant. Aïcha, the bubbly matriarch, looks youthful beyond her years, and can’t help but lapse into fits of shy giggles when prodded with questions about love and marriage. Husband Mabrouk is starkly withdrawn in contrast to her infectious warmth. As the couple decide to separate after 62 years of marriage, home videos of family celebrations become even more bittersweet in their fragile vibrancy.A familiar face in French cinema, Soualem’s father, Zinedine Soualem, says with a matter-of-fact sadness that Mabrouk never complimented him on the success of his career. Consequently the documentary feels like Lina Soualem’s attempt to break a cycle of generational miscommunication and repression. Unfolding with the gentle casualness of everyday conversation, her interviews with her grandparents not only draw her closer to their personal history but also paint a vivid picture of the hardships endured by Algerian immigrants in 1950s France. Mabrouk, for example, was among countless Algerian young men employed on low wages by a cutlery factory in Thiers. The loud noises resulting from the production of shiny knives and forks would later render many of these workers deaf.Throughout her film, Lina Soualem only appears in a tiny square on Zoom calls or as a little girl in old family home movies. Yet her presence is felt in her voice, floating in and out of conversations, and in the way she lovingly photographs her grandparents, down to Mabrouk’s white panama hat. Their Algeria not only travels to the past, it is also Soualem’s journey to discover her own Algeria. Their Algeria is released on 17 March on True Story"
Little English review – warm-hearted British-Asian family tale is easy to fall for,Pravesh Kumar’s clumsy but affectionate comedy about a Punjabi family living in Slough has the makings of a decent sitcom,3,"Theatre director Pravesh Kumar has written and directed an affectionate comedy about a dysfunctional British south Asian family. It’s a film very much in the tradition of sitcom-ish Brit movies: the comedy painted in broad strokes, warm-hearted but with an unmistakable air of naffness. It just about gets by on sheer likability and warmth for its Punjabi family living in a Slough semi.We meet them just as eldest son Raj (Simon Rivers) does a runner after his wedding to Simmy (Rameet Rauli); she’s newly arrived from India, barely speaking a word of English. The marriage has been arranged by Raj’s overbearing mum Gurbaksh (Seema Bowri). To keep up appearances with their nosy neighbours, she confiscates Simmy’s passport and keeps her new daughter-in-law locked up in the house. I did wonder if the film is a bit lighthearted in its treatment of domestic abuse.At first Simmy feels a gravitational pull of loyalty to her new family – and patiently waits for her awol husband to return. But soon she begins to find her feet: step one, learning English from the telly. Then the family’s youngest son Harry (Viraj Juneja) shows up, freshly released from prison – much to his mother’s shame. And you know exactly where the story is headed when Simmy accidentally trips into Harry’s arms the moment she first claps eyes on him.Clearly, Little English is made for a family audience. Even so, there are quite a few clumsily broad moments of comedy here. Some genuinely funny scenes too: an aunty armed with a taser gun brings down a thief. One afternoon Harry takes Simmy out by the river. “I never knew Slough could be so beautiful,” she says in wonder. Little English probably does have the makings of a decent sitcom; the process would develop the characters and perhaps get something sharper from the script, which feels like an early draft in places. Little English is released on 17 March in UK cinemas."
Condor’s Nest review – Tarantino-esque Nazi-hunt thriller heads for the pampas,"Director Phil Blattenberger wears his love for the genre on his sleeve, but this allows him to outrun the film’s uneven execution and loose plot",3,"American director Phil Blattenberger gets props here for stretching his budget clingfilm-thin to mount a respectable revival of a bygone genre: the you’ve-only-gone-and-blown-the-bloody-doors-off wartime 1960/70s action-adventure. Well, to be precise, the post-wartime action-adventure, with some sweeping pampas vistas and strategically deployed name casting – including a fleeting glimpse of old warhorse Michael Ironside – pepping up a South American Nazi hunt.“They say the man who seeks revenge should dig two graves,” is the advice proffered to one-time allied sniper Will Spalding (Jacob Keohane). He is in Argentina to atone for failing to protect his B17 crewmates when they are downed near enemy lines. Torturing and assassinating his way down a list of German expats, he is hunting for Colonel Martin Bach (The Mummy’s Arnold Vosloo), who executed his comrades in cold blood. A chance encounter in a bar with atomic physicist Albert Vogel (Al Pagano) points to where Bach is lying low, but the Mossad operative Leyna Rahn (Corinne Britti) is itching to liquidate the scientist before he can assist Spalding.With Bach acting as security chief to a certain A-list goosestepper imagined here to have survived the war, Blattenberger decides to ride the Tarantinoesque alt-history high road. Sometimes this inspiration becomes too apparent, especially in Jackson Rathbone’s genially menacing Nazi barfly – reminiscent of Christoph Waltz’s Hans Landa – and a digression on eugenics that echoes the skull scene in Django Unchained. But despite this, as well as a loose hand on the plotting rudder and often-shaky direction, Blattenberger’s energetic screenplay, with its obvious love for the genre, allows him to outrun these problems.Keohane is unremittingly dour in the lead and – until presented with a last-minute devil’s bargain that weighs up the meaning of heroism – not really called on to leaven it with introspection. But Pagano lives it up with an urbane playfulness as the scientist of uncertain allegiances, and Vosloo has an imposing dark integrity as the unapologetic party man. Despite the uneven execution, Condor’s Nest has just enough bite. Condor’s Nest is available on digital platforms on 20 March."
Words of Negroes review – sorcery trial documentary raises ghosts of slavery,"Workers at a sugar factory in Guadeloupe read the records of a trial that followed the death of a slave in 1842, with uncomfortably strong modern-day echoes",3,"The past returns in all its ugliness and torment in Sylvaine Dampierre’s rigorous documentary which challenges the preconceived notion that the march of time automatically parallels the march of progress. In 1842 in the Guadeloupe archipelago, an enslaved man named Sébastien was accused of sorcery by his master, and left to die in his cell. Centuries later, workers at a sugar factory in Marie-Galante, the island where Sébastien died, read out transcipts from the trial surrounding his death.In opening a portal to the cruelty suffered by Sébastien at the hands of his masters, who were acquitted, the film draws a link to labour exploitation endured by the factory workers in modern-day Marie-Galante. Their jobs are precarious and expendable. As employment opportunities on the island are scarce, the workers have little choice but to be subjected to gruelling conditions for inadequate wages. Scenes where the men harvest sugar cane under the burning sun eerily mirror passages from the historical court documents, which describe the physical toil of field work in harrowing detail. Slavery is long abolished, yet the current system of exploitation continues to leave little agency to the workers.Wrapped in a cacophony of hissing sounds and grinding metals, sequences shot inside the factory have a disquieting beauty, as they simultaneously evoke the rhythm of the workers’ daily rituals and reveal the bosses’ neglect for their wellbeing. Technologically outdated, and perhaps even dangerous to operate, some machines seem as old as the factory itself, which opened in 1996. In raising awareness of the hazardous environment experienced by the workers, Dampierre’s film powerfully traces how the hierarchies of the past continue to foster social inequalities in the present. Words of Negroes is available from 10 March on True Story."
The Middle Man review – Nordic black comedy set in small-town America,Norwegian director Bent Hamer’s drama about a luckless US town feels too oddly Scandinavian,3,"Karmack is a US town so unlucky that someone is employed specifically to deliver the daily batches of bad news. The latest “middle man” is Frank (Pål Sverre Hagen), who, it turns out, suffers from his own share of the town’s misfortunes. This English-language feature from Norwegian director Bent Hamer (Kitchen Stories) is infused with a very Nordic tragicomic sensibility. And this, together with a predominantly Scandinavian cast, means that the film feels oddly rootless, never quite persuading as a piece of small-town Americana. Still, it is ruefully entertaining and looks terrific, with a colour palette of sullen blues and ill-natured yellows."
Mary Cassatt: Painting the Modern Woman review – fine portrait of a neglected artist,A study of a female painter who exhibited with the first impressionists in 19th-century Paris but saw little of their renown is fascinating and moving,3,"Here is an interesting and, towards the end, actually quite moving study of American émigré painter Mary Cassatt, one of three female artists who took part in the celebrated impressionist exhibitions in late 19th-century Paris, and whose biographers here do an excellent job of reclaiming from relative obscurity. In fact, they do considerably more: Cassatt is built up to be a pioneering feminist voice in an art world that at the time was largely hostile to female painters.Unlike most of films in the Exhibition on Screen series, this is not related to a blockbuster exhibition, or even a specific collection: it’s instead a general overview of Cassatt’s life and work, starting with her privileged upbringing in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, before her near-permanent shift to Europe after the American civil war, and the consequent headway she made with the then radical impressionist movement (including her strong friendship and collaboration with Edgar Degas.)There’s certainly a corrective element to this film, highlighting a female artist in a series that has hitherto concentrated (understandably enough) on the likes of Monet, Vermeer and Raphael; this is an interesting and educative act of expanding the canon. Cassatt’s later paintings of women and children come in for a good deal of attention: finely painted and – as one of the expert voices says – quietly symbolic of Cassatt’s political commitment to female suffrage.Strictly as a documentary, this doesn’t depart from Exhibition on Screen’s standard template: leisurely closeups of the work, informed comment from knowledgable curators, the odd bit of voiceover and staged re-enactment. It does, however, draw Cassatt out as a tough and independent character, pursuing her own artistic path and very much worthy of the respect she has been largely denied by history.Mary Cassatt: Painting the Modern Woman is released on 8 March in cinemas."
The Curse of Rosalie review – horror moppet presides over thrift shop of evil,No scare prop is left out in a clunky tale of magical daggers and spooky furnishings as a family find their daughter is up to her eyes in hellishness,2,"Cluttered as it is with magical, mystical MacGuffins, ghosts, curses and ominous knick-knacks, this cheap but seldom cheerful horror feature is the cinematic equivalent of a thrift store of evil. The plot revolves around the Snyder family: insurance salesman dad Daniel (Will Klipstine, also the film’s writer-director), fervent Catholic mum Theresa (Amanda MacDonald), and young daughter and conduit of evil Rosalie (Madeleine McGraw). The poor kid used to be a happy, unexceptional moppet who, judging by the many saccharine sun-filled flashbacks we’re shown, enjoyed playing football and making cupcakes with her parents. But something happened along the way and now she ominously announces at funerals that the deceased is burning in hell at that very moment, and that a servant of the devil called the Harbinger has arrived (does that make her the Harbinger’s harbinger?).Either way, the Snyders move to what seems like an unremarkable midwestern suburb where the neighbours are super-creepy with their excessive hospitality and talk of neighbourhood watch. On the outskirts of town there’s a Native American seer called Floating Hawk (Irene Bedard) who conveniently dispenses exposition about what’s really going on which, honest-to-God, involves sacred burial grounds, giant keys and evil-dispersing daggers. If a monkey’s paw and a cursed amulet had been thrown in the mix, I wouldn’t have been surprised.It’s hard to call which is clunkier, Klipstine’s herky-jerky direction or his shouty acting. But at least you can give him some credit for casting McGraw, who can deliver her absurd dialogue with the kind of deadpan straight face that Buster Keaton would admire. Veteran supporting player Steve Monroe (Crazy Ex-Girlfriend) is also a hoot as a jocular neighbour who obviously isn’t the buffoon he seems to be. The Curse of Rosalie is on the Icon channel from 13 March and in UK cinemas from 14 April."
The Wife and Her House Husband review – divorce drama gets under the skin of marriage,The dynamics of a long relationship are under the microscope in Marcus Markou’s examination of a couple whose marriage is breaking down,3,"Ten years after directing and self-distributing his feature debut Papadopoulos & Sons, Marcus Markou is back with another impressively-put-together low-budget movie. This time around he’s made a serious and slightly self-conscious divorce drama with a pair of deeply-felt performances by Laura Bayston and Laurence Spellman. They play Cassie and Matthew, a couple from London, separating in their 40s.To the outside world, Cassie and Matthew’s divorce looks like the model of amicability: they’ve managed to agree on everything without going to court. But it gets messy at their final mediation session, as years of hurt and resentment boil over. Cassie has been the breadwinner, and she can’t help bringing up the fact that she’s “giving” Matthew the house. Furious, he yells that he gave up a career in teaching to raise the kids. It’s a shaky start to the film, a bit shouty with some awkwardly clumsy comedy inserted by their hopeless mediator.But the film gets into its stride as Cassie and Matthew carry out a series of tasks laid out in a letter they wrote together as newlyweds, addressed to their future selves in the event of divorce. The tasks (like going on their first date again) are clearly intended to rekindle their love. But after a couple of decades together it’s more complicated than that. Their marriage is like a vase smashed into a dozen pieces; the damage is done. But at times Cassie and Matthew seem to convince themselves it can be glued back together again.This is an interesting, worthwhile movie that genuinely gets under the skin of a long marriage – though at times the drama feels a bit contrived and overworked, especially scenes involving Cassie’s extramarital relationships. And what’s with that title? It feels years out of date to define a woman unironically as a “wife”, or call a man who works in the home a “house husband”.It is being shown in cinemas alongside Markou’s 12 minute film Two Strangers Who Meet Five Times (clearly he has a thing for lengthy and literal titles). The short, a sentimental tale about a damaged homeless man and a rich start-up entrepreneur, has racked up three million views on YouTube. The Wife and Her House Husband is released on 10 March in cinemas."
Adopting Audrey review – Jena Malone shines in kooky adult adoption tale,Her nuanced portrayal of a directionless thirtysomething seeking new parents redeems the annoyingly implausible tale unfolding around her,3,"Here’s another cutesy-sentimental American indie about a character struggling to grow up, and drifting with no real sense of what to do in life. Adopting Audrey takes it one further, turning the quirky dial up to 11 with its story about a woman who puts herself up for adoption in her 30s. (Adult adoption is legal in the US, though not in the UK)Audrey is played by Jena Malone with warmth and thoughtfulness; her performance the most distinctive thing about this otherwise forgettable movie. Audrey is single and often unable to pay the rent, flitting from job to job. You sense depression or loneliness creeping in, spending her evenings watching cute animal videos. One night YouTube’s algorithm pings her from puppy adoption videos to ones about human adult adoption; Audrey decides to give it a go.After a string of failed first dates with potential parents, she meets a retired couple who might just be her forever family. This is Sunny (Emily Kuroda) and Otto (Robert Hunger-Bühler), both widowed when they met a few years ago. Otto is a cranky retired Nasa engineer, who has a terrible relationship with his own adult children. But with Audrey he opens up a little and begins to reflect on his overbearing parenting style.What I found irritating about the film is how the characters behave in ways that bear no resemblance to the real world. Take Otto’s kids, who are mildly irked by Audrey’s arrival, but not remotely alarmed. Surely they would be straight on the phone to a lawyer t0 find out their inheritance rights? Or at the very least grilling Audrey about her intentions?Still, there’s something so winning about Malone. Her Audrey is nice and eager-to-please as she puts up with cantankerous Otto. But Malone suggests a kind of passive-aggressive side to her gentle manner, showing us that Audrey’s style is to take the crap for so long, then walk away. Her engrossing, authentic-feeling performance is the reason to watch. Adopting Audrey is released on 13 March on digital platforms."
Bandit review – shallow crime caper is saucer-eyed over real-life 1980s bank robber,"Josh Duhamel charms as ‘flying bandit’ Gilbert Galvan, who pulled off nearly 60 robberies across Canada, but this light-hearted retelling lacks any insight",2,"Bandit is one of those true-crime films where you come away with the impression that the film-makers have spent a bit too long hanging out with their subject, sitting in smoky bars listening to tall tales about the good ol’ bad days. It’s sincere enough but tells an utterly hokey and indulgent story about armed robber Gilbert Galvan, who went on a stick-up spree across Canada in the 1980s, pulling off nearly 60 robberies in three years targeting banks and jewellers. Newspapers called him “the flying bandit”.The film paints Galvan’s crimes as more or less victimless – repeatedly showing what a polite and cordial bank robber he is, never firing a gun. It’s a glossy old-fashioned movie, mixing a bit of action with tongue-in-cheek comedy. Josh Duhamel gives a performance that’s all charm and no depth as Galvan, a career criminal we first meet escaping from a Michigan prison and hightailing it north of the border. In Ottawa, he changes his name to Robert Whiteman and gets into the armed robbery business, bankrolled by a local criminal hardman (Mel Gibson, about as menacing as a fairy cake).Galvan’s first fumbling stick-up is played for laughs. “How did I do?” he asks the cashier at the end. And there’s a lot of focus here on his silly wigs and comedy disguises – what a nice-guy bank robber he is. (You can picture the director’s instructions to the actors playing the bank cashiers: “Look scared, but not that scared”.) The film is on pretty thin ice too with its shaky justifications for Galvin’s life of crime. He had a tough childhood, we learn, and when he meets trainee social worker Andrea (Elisha Cuthbert), he keeps on with the robberies to provide for his family. Duhamel is always an easy, likable watch, and this is a reasonably entertaining film – but not exactly abundant with insight. Bandit is available now on Prime Video."
"Subject review – exploitation, trauma and the ethics of documentary-making","The subjects of The Staircase, Hoop Dreams, Capturing the Friedmans and others contribute to this thoughtful film about the duty of care film-makers owe those whose stories they tell",4,"If you’ve seen the sensational true crime documentary series The Staircase, you’ll know the story. In 2001, after Kathleen Peterson was found dead at the bottom of the stairs at her home in North Carolina, police suspicion turned to her novelist husband Michael Peterson. When he allowed a documentary team to film what happened next, Peterson said it was because he was worried about getting a fair trial. His adopted daughter, Margaret Ratliff, 20 at the time, grief-stricken and terrified that her dad could be facing the death penalty, agreed to be part of the film. The loss of her privacy in the years since has been devastating, she admits now. “I can’t tell you how painful it is, reliving my mum’s death over and over again.”This super-thoughtful and sensitive documentary also interviews the “stars” of other well-known documentaries. Arthur Agee was a 14-year-old basketball prodigy from a tough neighbourhood in Chicago when film-makers arrived to shoot Hoop Dreams. Jesse Friedman spent 13 years in jail after he and his father Arnold pleaded guilty in 1998 to sexually abusing children – a conviction put into doubt by the 2003 film Capturing the Friedmans. Mukunda Angulo was raised in a New York apartment isolated from the world by his controlling dad, as detailed in The Wolfpack.Ratliff never received a penny for her involvement in The Staircase, and in Subject, industry experts argue for and against paying participants. I found myself agreeing that it’s unfair for a subject to be the only one not making money from their own story. A producer of Hoop Dreams explains that when the film became a surprise box office hit, they went back to Chicago and gave everyone with a speaking role a cut of the profits. For Arthur Agee, that money has been life-changing – around $500,000 to date.The question of who gets to tell stories is discussed (spoiler: mostly white men, until recently), and for a 97-minute film, Subject squeezes in a lot of ethical biggies. What duty of care do you owe a person if you sweep them up into a movie? Does a film-maker need to consider the mental health of a subject? One expert argues that if film contracts can include intimacy coordinators, why not also counsellors? Ratliff is only too aware of the toll that being in a hit documentary can take: “It messed up me and my sister so bad.”Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotion Subject is released on 3 March in UK cinemas."
Bad City review – retro homage to 80s Japanese thrillers is elegantly pulpy,A taskforce of honest cops is assembled to tackle the gangsters menacing Kaiko City. Many punches are thrown in choreographed style,3,"Director Kensuke Sonomura started off as a stunt performer and coordinator, so it’s no surprise that his second directorial effort contains lashings of hand-to-hand combat. Indeed, just as the climactic cops v gangsters showdown is about to kick off, elderly lawman Torada (Hitoshi Ozawa) urges everyone not to use silly, unsporting guns, and miraculously both sides agree and go to it with fists and knives. It’s just as well because, hitherto, almost every time someone has fired a gun in anger in this film they have missed the target. Does that mean all those movies where folks hit their target with one bullet are lying? Or is this one, where everyone is pants at shooting, the misrepresentation? Either way, it’s almost enough to make you question your core beliefs in the efficacy of cinematic firearms.Anyway, if you like watching actors and stunt folk battle it out, this is great stuff but the connecting plot strung between fights is more of a chore. In fictional Japanese metropolis Kaiko City, corruption is rife and it all seems to stem from Wataru Gojo (Lily Franky) who has designs on redeveloping a poor part of the city. As Gojo is announcing his bid to become Kaiko’s mayor, we see a bathhouse of lushly tattooed yakuza get wiped out by a single long-haired squinting assassin (Tak Sakaguchi). Is he working for Madam (Rino Katase), queenpin of the Korean mafia in Kaiko, who rather entertainingly dresses like someone trying to shoplift all the stock from a Versace boutique at the same time. The chief prosecutor and his assistant put together a taskforce of honest cops from the Violent Crimes unit, and place Torada in charge, even though up until now he’s been in jail on charges that connect him to Madam.Now in his 60s, Ozawa was a major player back in the days of Japan’s V-Cinema, straight-to-video films that were cult viewing in the 1980s and 90s; consequently Bad City represents a retro homage to the pulpy values of that subgenre. Some viewers may find it a little too pulpy, reliant as it is on boilerplate dialogue, and it is not exactly rich in subtlety. All the nuance is in the grace of the fight scenes, as lovingly choreographed as a production of Swan Lake. Bad City is released on 6 March on digital platforms."
I’m Fine (Thanks for Asking) review – lyrical study of pandemic LA homelessness ,Drama about a mother and daughter’s struggle to stay afloat in the pandemic holds on to a warm optimism,4,"This pandemic-set drama exudes frustration and exasperation, but always remains in touch with an essential openness and optimism. It’s anchored in a smart performance from co-director Kalley Kali who, as bereaved gig-economy hustler Danny, seems in a permanent state of sadness and mild distraction – though possibly the latter is something to do with the fact she performs most of the time on rollerblades.Danny is living in a tent in the scrub somewhere on the edge of Los Angeles (presumably Pacoima, where this was filmed) with her eight-year-old daughter, Wes (Wesley Moss). She tells her kid that it’s just for fun, trying to shield her from the harsh truth: they’ve become homeless following the death of her partner and Wes’s father. After dropping Wes off at daycare, Danny straps on her leopard-print blades and, moonlighting between hair-braiding and food delivery, attempts to squeeze out the $200 she needs before day’s end to make a deposit on a flat.After a couple of disappointing hair appointments, Danny runs into cocksure old friend Brooklynn (BK Marie) at the launderette; she’s about to move her family in with her new fella, despite having only been with him for two weeks. In this scene, in a pawnshop where Danny agonises about selling her partner’s ring to a flirty player, and in a disturbing encounter with a friend, Kali and co-director Dominique Molina push a wry but pointed focus on women resorting to sexual currency in tough times – or refusing to do so.As Danny is hauled about town at a delivery app’s behest, I’m Fine (Thanks for Asking)’s plotting occasionally feels a bit baldly linear – but it increasingly flexes a lyrical muscle, beginning with a surrealist plunge into stoned anxiety, building up to a stunning LA reverie that releases all Danny’s maternal relief in one go. Kali and Molina’s sun-kissed naturalism and light touch make them a promising new voice in American cinema. I’m Fine (Thanks for Asking) is released on 3 March in UK cinemas."
Broker review – Kore-eda gets the tone all wrong in sudsy Korean baby adoption tale,The director of Shoplifters shows naivety in trying to turn two baby kidnappers into lovable rogues. Even Parasite’s Song Kang-ho can’t make it stick,2,"Hirokazu Kore-eda can claim to be the greatest living Japanese film director, whose family dramas have marked him out as the heir to Ozu (although in an interview with me he said he preferred to be compared with Mikio Naruse). His work, including the Palme-winning Shoplifters (2018) is rightly revered. But he has always had a sweet tooth for whimsy and sentimentality, which I thought was on display in his much admired baby-swap drama Like Father Like Son (2013).Now he has given us a sudsy road-movie heartwarmer set in Korea and inspired by the Korean phenomenon of “baby boxes” put out by churches for unwanted newborns. But the movie is fundamentally silly, with tiringly shallow characterisation and broad streaks of crime-drama intrigue, which only underline the fact that not a single word of it is really believable.Korean actor Song Kang-ho (famed for starring in Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite) plays Sang-hyeon, a volunteer at a local church that has a “baby box”. But he is running a “broker” scam: occasionally he steals a newborn for himself – erasing the church’s CCTV footage that prove a baby was left there – and offers it for sale on the adoption black market, with potential couples lined up by his partner Dong-soo (Gang Dong-won), a former orphanage inhabitant with access to information about potential adopters who want newborns rather than institutionalised toddlers. But their lives are made more complicated when young mother So-young (Lee Ji-eun), whose unwanted baby is taken and offered up for sale by these two tricksters, confronts them and instead of telling the police, insists on coming with them on their zany road-trip to interview potential parents. On their trail are a couple of cops, played by Bae Doona and Lee Joo-young.Of course, in the real world, the people running such a nauseating scam would be creepy and loathsome individuals. And let’s say they were claiming – as these two fictional characters are – that they were doing the world a service by sidestepping bureaucracy and dreary orphanage care by getting the babies quickly to adoptive parents and moreover handing over most of the fee to the mother, then this, too, would be highly suspect and naive. What sort of people might want to pay top dollar for a baby?But the film presents the two as just lovable, flawed guys who are romantics at heart: tough cookie So-young even tells goofy young Dong-so that he needs to be more hard-hearted because sweet guys like him get eaten alive. The criminality of the proceedings is assigned to the mother, who turns out to have a shadier background than we at first assume. Of course, if anyone can sell such a dodgy premise it is that wonderful actor, Song Kang-ho, but his air of hangdog everyman decency can’t solve the problems of naivety, implausibility and the sugary taste. It’s a rare miss for Kore-eda. Broker screened at the Cannes film festival, and is released in UK cinemas on 24 February."
"Derek Jarman’s Jubilee reviewed – archive, 1978",23 February 1978: Britain’s first film to reflect the punk era possesses a fevered and restless imagination – and the images and music to go with it,0,"Jubilee (X, of course) arrives this week at the Gate Two. Which, in case you don’t recognise the cinema, is the former International Bloomsbury, now leased and, one hopes, given a new lease of life by David and Barbara Stone of the Gate, Notting Hill.Jubilee, directed and part-written with James Whaley, by Derek Jarman who made the successful Sebastiane, is not exactly a punk movie. But it does contain music from Adam and the Ants, Siouxsie and the Banshees and Electric Chairs, and characters with such names as Crabs, Amyl Nitrate, Mad and Chaos. The scent of anarchy is near at hand and the current fad for believing that there is nothing left to believe in is everywhere apparent (“Love snuffed it with the hippies. Sex is for geriatrics,” says someone. Myra Hindley is described as a childhood heroine).Jarman’s story looks promising enough. Queen Elizabeth (Jenny Runacre), that historic precursor of modern capitalism, arrives back in a future London (courtesy of John Dee, alchemist, and the Angel Ariel) to find her perfumed garden in total rout. Law and order no longer exist, the old and cherished institutions have finally crumbled and extremists of both left and right are out on the blitz. Royalty is now best represented by Borgia Ginz (Orlando, of the Lindsay Kemp Troupe), a giggling media mogul who gives the people what they want and thus controls them. He uses Buck Palace as a giant recording studio.The past and future meet on a waste tip in Deptford where Bod (Ms Runacre again) crowns herself Queen as the leader of a band of harpies that include a pop singer, a pyromaniac and a nymphomaniac. Amyl Nitrate (Jordan) has been chosen by Borgia to represent England in the Eurovision with a bump-and-grind version of Rule Britannia! But first an ageing punk star has to be eliminated, and meanwhile Crabs (Little Nell) falls for the Kid (Adam Ant) who gets snuffed by the special branch. And the gang seeks bloody revenge.Thus, or so the synopsis informs us, the film progresses from black comedy into real terror. Actually it tends to go from somewhere to nowhere very much. This has a lot to do with the thinness of the political and social comment, the disjointed nature of the narrative and some overbearing and/or underskilled playing. Shock tactics alone won’t suffice in the cinema, though they may well pay dividends in box office returns.But one thing the film does possess is a fevered and restless imagination, and the images and music to go with it. Brian Eno’s score is first-class, and the general feel of a world hideously out of joint (vide the Godardian burning pram sequence) is well maintained. Jubilee may not be a very good film. But the fact that it exists at all is a kind of justification in the present circumstances. Besides, I’m inclined to think that the humour behind its pretension (“Piss, I’ve broke me Winston Churchill mug”) might just be the saving of it. That and Mr Jarman’s genuine talent for confounding expectations."
Afire review – useless-author comedy-drama in saga of angst and lust ,A gloomy writer and his friend are trapped with strangers in a Baltic holiday home in Christian Petzold’s tonally wayward tale,2,"Christian Petzold has for years been a titan of German cinema – and the Berlin film festival itself – and his new movie is an odd, quibbling tragicomedy with perhaps a little of Bergman’s Smiles of a Summer Night, avowedly intended as the second part of a trilogy about creativity and love (the first being Undine).Afire is an approachable and digestible movie in some ways, and I liked the morose, hangdog look conjured by actor Thomas Schubert playing the miserable young writer Leon, who correctly suspects that his new novel, a zeitgeisty relationship comedy called Club Sandwich, is terrible. But in the end I felt that the film fully achieves neither the ostensible comedy of the opening, nor the supposed sadness of its denouement.Leon and his art student friend Felix(Langston Uibel) have come to a holiday home belonging to Felix’s mum on the Baltic coast, to relax and do some work: Leon will revise his manuscript, and Felix will take some photographs for his portfolio. But their car breaks down on the way and after they turn up, exhausted and on foot, they find that Felix’s mum has let the house to another couple with whom they have to share: Nadja (Paula Beer) and her hunky lifeguard boyfriend Devid (Enno Trebs).Poor Leon soon conceives a hopeless crush on Nadja and gets no sleep listening to her having athletic sex with Devid in the adjacent bedroom; moreover, Felix seems also to have a man crush on the alpha male lifeguard. Leon’s publisher Helmut (Matthias Brandt) is also about to visit, with what promises to be some damaging notes on his book, while the forest fires, turning the night sky red, convey a strange sense of unease.In fact, despite the title (the film’s original German title actually translates as “Red Sky”), there isn’t much of a flame in this film. There are some laughs in Leon’s grumpy, maladroit failure to be agreeable with anyone, as well as his knack of saying the wrong thing with Nadja, for which he berates himself afterwards in private like a young Hugh Grant in a Richard Curtis comedy. And there are some nice scenes as they all have dinner together, or hang out at the beach.The appearance of Helmut signals a supposed new serious shift, and Nadja’s background is revealed. A poem by Heinrich Heine is invoked: Der Asra, about a slave falling in love with a princess. But the tonal change is not really convincing, and I wished that the movie’s potential for lighter comedy had been developed more. Even so, it’s a strong performance from Schubert. Afire screened at the Berlin film festival and is released on 25 August in UK cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema."
"20,000 Species of Bees review – trans kid struggles to find a place in family eco-system","A child’s gender identity crisis is mirrored by her mother’s crisis of identity as an artist in this warm, generously performed film",3,"There’s gentleness and delicacy in this heartfelt family drama, a fiction feature debut from Basque film-maker Estibaliz Urresola Solaguren. It shows that the crises experienced by children, and by the adults coming to terms with those crises, are part of a larger ecosystem of emotional difficulty in the extended family.Ane (Patricia López Arnaiz) is a sculptor living in south-west France. She has money worries and problems in her marriage to Gorka (Martxelo Rubio). They have three children, of whom the most troubled is Cocó (Sofía Otero). Eight-year-old Cocó’s worries and self-questioning emerge when Ane has to take the kids away for a summer break over the border in the Basque Country of Spain, staying with her widowed mother Lourdes (Ane Gaberain), who is now devoted to her beekeeping hobby but whose main occupation was once managing financial accounts for her husband, an artist, like Ane.Cocó’s given name was in fact originally the boy’s name Aitor, but switched to the indeterminate nickname Cocó – though even this now feels wrong and Cocó asks Ane to use the name “Lucía”. And it turns out that Lucía only really feels calm and happy in the company of her grandmother and her bees, of which there are, significantly, many different sorts. But there are troubles ahead when a family christening looms at which Lucía and the other children are expected to wear special formal clothes and Lucía will want to wear a dress. Heartsinkingly, Lucía even asks if she can die and be born again as a girl.Ane does not wish to deny Lucía’s gender identity, although it is never exactly phrased in these terms, but she has concerns, and her husband worries that it is too early to be thinking like this in the first place. But Ane has identity issues of her own: her identity as an artist. Over the summer she wants to work on sculpture projects in the workshop that her late father used, and it is clear that this is a subject of some pain to her mother, because Ane’s father became notorious in the locality for taking naked photographic studies of young girls. And her grandmother, calmly content to use Lucía’s female pronouns, tells Ane not to “turn a blind eye” to Lucía’s wishes in the same way that she turned a blind eye to what was happening with her husband.There is food for thought in that analogy. And the confrontation between Ane and her mother over the value of Ane’s vocation as an artist has, in its way, a sharply human dramatic point that the rest of the movie perhaps does not. But it is a warm and generously performed film. 20,000 Species of Bees screened at the Berlin film festival and is released on 27 October in UK cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema."
Charm Circle review – Grey Gardens-ish portrait of director’s dysfunctional family,Nira Burstein’s documentary focuses on the acutely troubled lives of her closest relations – and it’s not a happy picture,3,"Like so many young artists, film-maker Nira Burstein has taken the advice to write – or in this case, film – what she knows, so for her first feature she’s turned the camera on her own family, a troubled brood from the outer suburbs of New York City. Although Nira holds the camera herself for much of the time, she edits in home movie footage from many years ago which shows how dramatically time and stress have worn the family down.The Burstein patriarch Uri is definitely a character, either the film’s villain, comic relief or hero depending on where you stand. A former realtor and part-time guitarist, he wears a yarmulke most of the time and invokes his Jewish religious beliefs as an excuse when he doesn’t want to attend the wedding of his daughter Adina, Nira’s sister, to two non-binary people with whom she’s decided to form a lasting throuple. Uri’s wife Raya, a former musician herself, earned a master’s from Columbia and once practised as an occupational therapist. But around the time that eldest daughter Judy, variously diagnosed with Tourette syndrome and obsessive compulsive disorder, became “sick” with unspecified problems, Raya also had a breakdown and checked into a psychiatric facility. Professionals, according to Raya and Uri, have labelled her bipolar or schizophrenic, but Uri at least is less interested in clinical diagnoses than with how to cope with Raya and Judy’s behaviours and complains about them constantly. (He notes that even celebrity physician/neurologist Oliver Sacks examined Judy and couldn’t tell what exactly was wrong with her.)Whatever the clinical backstory, this is one very dysfunctional family. Long-held resentments are never more than a millimetre under the surface and a general lack of routine or ability to cope means Uri and Raya live in squalor, with dirty dishes, clutter and cat poo in every room. Mira’s non-judgmental, affectionate view of them has tenderness and an eye for their absurdities; it’s impossible not to see parallels with Grey Gardens, another film about an eccentric family living with cats in the greater New York metropolitan conurbation. That said, Burstein doesn’t yet have the same film-making instincts as the Maysles brothers, and this family seems a lot more unhappy than the daffy Beales of Grey Gardens which makes for depressing viewing. Charm Circle is released on 24 February in cinemas."
The Lion Has Seven Heads review – a fierce revolutionary leftist bad dream from 1970 ,"With its white-robed preacher striding through Congo-Brazzaville, this denunciation of imperialism from Brazilian director Glauber Rocha is very much of its time",4,"This 1970 film from Brazilian director Glauber Rocha is an avant-gardist adventurethat offers us a theatre of absurdity and a theatre of cruelty of an obviously Godardian sort, and Rocha arguably had quite as much sense of composition and camera movement as Godard. (Rocha actually has a cameo in a film Godard worked on, Wind From the East, in which a woman with a movie camera approaches him and says: “Excuse me for interrupting your class struggle, but could you please point me the way towards political cinema?”)The Lion Has Seven Heads is a denunciation of imperialism and an essay in revolutionary thinking that is very much of its time. Opinions may divide now about exactly how well this film has aged; certainly, there is bit of posturing, and the casual use of “Marlene” (Rada Rassimov) – a naked blond woman writhing around and being variously pawed, harangued and imprisoned – as a symbol of colonial desire shows how very male leftist political cinema could be.The title refers to the seven-headed beast of the Book of Revelation, symbolising perhaps the earthly oppressive forms of power deployed by the antichrist: kings, consuls, dictators, magistrates, tribunes, emperors and potentates (although of course any amount of exegesis is possible). Jean-Pierre Léaud plays a white-robed preacher striding and declaiming with surreal strangeness across the landscape of Congo-Brazzaville. A weirdly detached, choric figure, he meets a Congolese revolutionary with whom he appears to make common cause, a guerrilla fighter and a bourgeois local politician who is being controlled by outside forces, including the CIA.The film proceeds in a series of bizarre and startling tableaux, often composed in such a way that everyone is addressing the camera head-on. Nonprofessional Congolese dancers and people are used, performing in the background to stylised and contrived situations in front of the camera. The use of the local people in this film is something else that jars a little now in its not-so-subtle condescension, particularly the rather crass mock execution scene. In fact the film itself is a kind of outsider incursion.But The Lion Has Seven Heads has its own fierce, mad conviction, a bad dream being reconstructed by actors after the event – and the film itself has historical value. This was a time when revolution and the purported inevitability of revolutionary violence was a live issue on the left, and this film engaged with these troubling ideas. The Lion Has Seven Heads is available on 27 February on Mubi."
Stop-Zemlia review – tender Ukraine teen drama is unbearably poignant ,"Director Kateryna Gornostai’s documentary-like film, originally released in 2021, has assumed a heartbreaking new significance since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine ",4,"This gentle, authentic-feeling coming-of-age drama from Ukrainian film-maker Kateryna Gornostai premiered at the Berlin festival in 2021. Released in the UK almost a year to the day since the Russian invasion, her film has become unbearably poignant. It follows a class of 16-year-olds over the course of a single winter: nothing major happens; they hang out, drink a fair bit, party a little, grapple with sexuality and mental health. Actually, the loveliest thing about the film is how it keeps them all safe. They are nice kids; we leave them with everything to live for.At times it feels like we’re watching a documentary. The actors seem so relaxed and intimate – like actual classmates who’ve grown up together over the years, and who know each other inside out. The main focus is Masha (Maria Fedorchenko), a hunch-shouldered shy girl with huge eyes and cropped Mia Farrow hair. Masha is a bit of an outsider in class, but she’s confident with her friends Yana (Yana Isaienko) and Senia (Arsenii Markov), an absolute sweetheart. Everyone thinks Senia is gay; he’s OK with that.The film is so light on its feet, and feels so effortless. Adding to the fly-on-wall texture, there’s some talking-head-style interviews – shot as if a film-maker has come into school to speak to the kids about life’s biggies: love, friendship, hopes and dreams. This is at the end of the school year in summer, as swifts shriek in the background (a reminder, perhaps, of how fleetingly special this moment of adolescence is).Watching the film now, a scene in the school’s basement is incredibly sad. The class troops in for “pre-conscription training” – a solider teaches them how to load and shoot a rifle. They’re mostly giggling, no clue of what’s to come. In real life, two of the cast and crew have been killed by war: the production designer and one of the adult actors. Most of the teenagers are now living abroad. Director Kateryna Gornostai has been volunteering in a community kitchen in Kyiv. I really hope she gets the chance to make another film. Stop-Zemlia is available on 23 February on Klassiki."
Kiss the Future review – Bono and U2 keep hope alive in Sarajevo,"Nenad Cicin-Sain’s documentary tells the story of a maverick film-maker who, with extraordinary persistence, induced the Irish rockers to keep the spotlight firmly on the Bosnian war ",4,"Thirty years on, the Bosnian war still has the power to horrify, with its genocidal massacres and concentration camps in the heart of Europe even as international leaders solemnly avowed their determination never to repeat the nightmare of the second world war. Even now, cultural commentators call the 1990s the “Seinfeld decade” where nothing happened, disregarding the carnage in former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.Nenad Cicin-Sain’s music documentary gives us an unofficial, unlicensed look at the nightmare of Sarajevo and the way that rock music kept humanity and hope alive: the rough-and-ready gigs and discos happening in Sarajevo’s battered garages and bomb shelters, while war raged above. It also tells the story of a maverick American journalist and film-maker called Bill Carter, a member of the ragtag expat group of aid workers, musicians and artists in Sarajevo, who was electrified by the sight of U2’s Bono on MTV talking about the Bosnian war. With extraordinary persistence, Carter got an interview with Bono for Bosnian TV, induced the band to do live TV linkup interviews on stage with Bosnian people during their colossal Zoo TV Tour and finally inspired the band to mount a giant concert in Sarajevo in 1997 supported by local bands and a Muslim women’s choir, after the Dayton Accords peace agreement. People interviewed here believe that the Bosnian war only properly ended when Bono took to the stage and yelled: “Fuck the past, kiss the future!”Of course, it isn’t that simple. The globalist grandiloquence of U2 is always in danger of looking naive. But the documentary is an interesting reminder that it is precisely that naive, ahistorical, ungrownup quality of rock music, its youth, its (arguable) callowness, its idealism, which is what made it so potent and so inclusive. And Bono himself, a man who has – in the Scots phrase – no small opinion of himself, was the guy to make it happen: he had the audacity and the imagination. There were limits to what he could do during the war itself, and the Sarajevo people themselves began to suspect that their pain was being used as set-dressing for U2’s tour; it caused a temporary rift in the love affair between the band and the Bosnians. But U2 became an important part of keeping the world focused on the Bosnian war when plenty of influential people on the left and right were in favour of forgetting all about them. And music reminded Sarajevans that they were human and they had a way of defying the carnage.Perhaps there was no place in this documentary to say it, but it’s important to realise just how much the word “Sarajevo” scared the geopolitical classes: the thought that intervention would risk replaying August 1914. As it turned out, one reason why western military activity was thinkable was that Russia was too demoralised by the collapse of communism to respond in the interest of its traditional ally: the Serbs.Which brings us to what that future was which everyone kissed in that huge and euphoric U2 concert in Sarajevo. The grim answer is obvious before the film explicitly raises it in a final TV news montage. Serbia’s president Slobodan Milošević provided a model of belligerent ethnic fascism and land-grabbing tyranny that is now written large by Vladimir Putin. One interviewee says that a Bono/Sarajevo concert is needed again, but the thought that it can only be staged after the war is over must give us pause. This movie is a time-capsule of Europe’s recent tragic past. Kiss the Future screened at the Berlin film festival."
Attachment review – queer horror romcom is a rare Valentine’s Day treat,Director Gabriel Bier Gislason deftly combines dry Jewish humour with horror to create a surprisingly compelling and emotionally complex date-night thriller ,3,"For a horror film about the terror of demonic possession, Gabriel Bier Gislason’s feature-film debut is unexpectedly charming. Having fallen in love after an adorable meet-cute, Danish has-been performer Maja (Josephine Park) impulsively moves in with Jewish academic Leah (Ellie Kendrick), who suffers from a mysterious injury. Their romance is watched over by Leah’s ultra-Orthodox mother, Chana (The Killing’s Sofie Gråbøl), who fusses over Leah’s every need with an insistence that borders on possessiveness.The awkward interactions that spring out of this clash between an overbearing parent and a gentile outsider are portrayed with that entertaining dry humour of classic Jewish comedy, yet there are also darker forces at play. As Maja bumbles through a series of cultural faux-pas – imagine frying bacon for your Jewish hookup! – she also comes across strange clues, like small piles of salt strategically sprinkled around Leah’s flat. Is Chana actually nursing Leah back to health or is she manipulating her daughter through black magic?The deftness with which Gislason balances the conventions of the comedy of manners with the paranoia of navigating a closed community makes Attachment especially compelling. There’s an emotionally complex performance from Gråbøl, and David Dencik is also hugely charismatic as Leah’s uncle Lev, as hilariously deadpan as he is enigmatic.Compared to the engaging script, which is steeped in Jewish folklore and superstitions surrounding malicious spirits called dybbuks, the visuals are flatter and generic: some indoor sequences have such low lighting that it’s difficult to make out what’s happening. Still, the refreshing – and rare – blend of Jewish humour and horror makes Attachment a fun Valentine’s Day watch for those who like their queer romance with a sprinkle of spooky chill. Attachment is available on Shudder."
Make Me Famous review – dirt-dishing study of the glory days of the Lower East Side,This touching documentary revisits the grimy Manhattan of the 70s and 80s in search of long-lost painter Edward Brezinski,3,"If All the Beauty and the Bloodshed, the recent documentary featuring photographer Nan Goldin, has whetted your appetite for the scuzzy glory days of Manhattan’s Lower East Side in the 1970s and 80s, then this documentary about Edward Brezinski, another artist kicking around the Bowery at the time, will quench that thirst. Interestingly, Goldin is never mentioned in this film, but a few art-world figures such as actor-critic Cookie Mueller and artist David Wojnarowicz overlap both films. No doubt there must have gallery openings or parties where Brezinski and Goldin were in the same room or even met one another, and this work clearly demonstrates that the NYC art scene was a small, almost incestuous circle where nearly everyone slept with everyone, especially before Aids arrived, and they all bitched about each other constantly.There is indeed a lot of bitching in the early part of Make Me Famous from those who remember Brezinski, a talented, ambitious painter from Michigan who rocked up to the East Village in the late 70s, yet never achieved the fame of contemporaries such as Jean-Michel Basquiat or Keith Haring. Not for lack of trying, it seems. One interviewee here cattily recalls how Brezinski, who ran a tiny gallery out of his own apartment on the sixth floor of a dilapidated building on East 3rd Street opposite a homeless shelter for men, would hand out cards advertising his shows at other people’s openings – a grave violation of the codes of cool.A few are fonder of him, including artist David McDermott who was Brezinski’s lover. They recollect him as quite charming but a perfectionist, who would get models to sit all day for him while he painted, and then rub out the result if he wasn’t happy with it. For most of his life Brezinski was dirt poor and when he did get money he immediately spent it on oil paint. His work, so much in the tradition of German expressionism that he was later included in a posthumous show at MOMA about American expressionists, is indeed striking but admittedly not outstandingly so. It’s therefore understandable that, when he died in 2007, his obituaries mostly mentioned his great acts of notoriety: eating a doughnut covered in resin that was part of an art work by Robert Gober, and throwing a glass of wine at art dealer Annina Nosei at a party.Director Brian Vincent and his producer Heather Spore appear on camera as they go in search of Brezinski’s past, accompanied towards the end by charming ageing scenesters Marguerite Van Cook and James Romberger who travel with the film-makers to Cannes to see where Edward died, or indeed find out if he’s definitely dead. As a narrative, it gets a bit repetitive by the time we get to France, but the abundance of home video footage from back in the day, and campy dirt-dishing from the interviewees, makes for a touching look at halcyon period in New York history, before the last shabby corners of Manhattan were gentrified beyond all recognition. Make Me Famous is released on 17 February in UK cinemas."
Daughter review – kidnap horror keeps it in the creepy family,"Corey Deshon’s debut feature has echoes of horrific cases of basement imprisonment, but doesn’t quite coalesce into a clear vision",3,"There are echoes of the Turpin case and Josef Fritzl’s basement in this tense arthouse horror shot in grainy 16mm with auteurish confidence by first-time film-maker Corey Deshon. It opens with a claim to be “more based on fact than fiction”, but actually tells an entirely fictional story about the kidnapping of a young woman (Vivien Ngô) who wakes up shackled to the floor in a garage. In front of her stands a man known only as Father (Casper Van Dien). You can tell instantly from his plaid checked shirt, beige slacks and straight-backed posture that he’s the type of Christian you don’t mess with in a horror movie: wholesome looking, but unhinged.“We’re not violent people,” Father tells the chained-up woman, sounding almost reasonable. It’s not true. In a disturbing, disorientating scene over the opening credits we’ve just watched him in a gas mask chase down another young woman and bludgeon her to death. This new woman is her replacement, kidnapped by Father to be a big sister to his son, Brother (Ian Alexander), a frail boy of about 11. Brother has been raised in isolation, taught that air in the outside world is toxic. Rounding off the creepy family is Mother played with brilliant slyness by Elyse Dinh: is she a quietly submissive wife, or just giving a good performance?At points I wondered if this is a film that tells us anything about anything. Some of its ideas feel a bit thrown together. There are no firm clues as to Father’s motives: he comes across as a man who’d like to have been an authoritarian cult leader if only he had the necessary charisma. But other characters feel a bit under-written – particularly Brother, who we sense is eager to please his dad, and possibly his successor. Daughter is released on 20 February on digital platforms."
Next Exit review – road trip romcom with death as the final destination,"Mali Elfman’s curious debut feature starts out as a high-concept dystopian sci-fi discussing what lies beyond, but ends up in familiar romantic territory",3,"In Jean-Paul Sartre’s No Exit, three dead strangers find themselves locked in a room for eternity, famously giving us that line about hell being other people. Riffing on the idea, Mali Elfman’s debut feature follows two strangers trapped in a car, alive but with death not far off on the horizon.Elfman’s film kicks off with an intriguing premise: science has conclusively proven the existence of an afterlife; death is not the end. The brilliant scientist-entrepreneur behind the discovery is Dr Stevenson, played by Karen Gillan channelling Elizabeth Holmes energy, with a surprisingly deep voice and a slash of bright red lipstick. Disappointingly we only see her in a handful of clips: a few slick media appearances and recorded messages for her institute, Life Beyond.The main focus here is the two people thrown together for the hell of a five-day road trip with a stranger, from New York to the Life Beyond in San Francisco. Both have signed up as volunteers for euthanasia in the name of research. Rose (Katie Parker) is a woman with her finger constantly hovering above the self-destruct button; exhausted, done with self-hatred and shame. English actor Rahul Kohli gives a super likable performance as Teddy, her travelling companion, who loftily explains that he wants to contribute to science with his death, to leave his mark on the world. The truth is that he’s filled with middle-age dread and failure. Rose and Teddy can’t stand each other – so obviously, it’s love.The movie begins well as a high-concept indie. This new evidence of an afterlife has a destabilising effect on society: suicides and homicides are skyrocketing; violent robberies are down (since people are no longer scared of dying). But then a romance plotline gets muddled into this what-if dystopian sci-fi tale. After that it cops out, becoming a fairly average road-trip movie about redemption with love as the answer to life’s meaninglessness. Next Exit is released on 20 February on digital platforms."
Nelly and Nadine review – tender tale of lesbian concentration camp survivors ,Magnus Gertten’s film follows an ambassador’s daughter and an opera singer who fell in love while being held by the Nazis,3,"This documentary opens with newsreel footage of concentration camp survivors arriving by boat in Sweden in 1945 – they are mostly women, smiling and waving at the camera. Director Magnus Gertten explains that he’s spent years trying to put names to the faces. One is a Dutch socialist and feminist who returned to Amsterdam after the war to her women’s health clinic; another a 16-year-old Jewish girl from Poland with a beautiful smile who does not yet know that she is the only survivor in her family. Finally, the face of a Chinese woman, not smiling, but fixing the camera with an intense stare.This last is Nadine Hwang, born into privilege in Madrid, the daughter of China’s ambassador to Spain and a Belgian mother. The reason behind Nadine’s intense expression is that she does not yet know the fate of the woman she fell in love with at the Ravensbrück concentration camp: a French opera singer called Q. They were separated when Nelly was transferred to the Mauthausen camp.With his tender, gentle-going film Gertten tells their love story. It unfolds from the perspective of Nelly’s granddaughter Sylvie Bianchi as she excavates the boxes of photos and diaries left by her grandmother, piecing it all together. Luckily, Nelly did survive the camps – but only just, after contracting dysentery. She’d been a spy for the French resistance and was arrested by the SS while on a singing tour in 1944. Nadine, who had moved from Beijing to Paris in the 1930s, was imprisoned for helping people flee the Nazis across the Pyrenees to Spain. After the war, the two women were reunited and emigrated to Venezuela with Nelly’s daughter. They spent the rest of their lives together.The film gives us a precious glimpse into LGBTQ+ life in the postwar period. Nadine was a wonderful photographer; her snaps and Super 8 films capture the couple’s glamorous, intimate parties at home in Caracas with their gay friends – “the boys” – drinking champagne and looking fabulous. In one they lightly caress each other’s fingers, Nadine in a beautifully tailored men’s suit, Nelly as gorgeous as a movie star.From their time in the camp, Nelly’s diaries, miraculously, survive; they are written in pencil, the prose harrowing and haunting. Later, Nelly and Nadine edited and typed up the diaries for publication. A little naively, Nelly’s granddaughter wonders why this lesbian love story was rejected for publication in the postwar years. Surely now a publisher will snap it up pronto.Nelly and Nadine is released on 10 February at Bertha DocHouse, London."
Jane review – high stakes and high anxiety in teen frenemy thriller,"Director Sabrina Jaglom follows in the tradition of Heathers and Election by tapping into a particular species of female neurosis turned toxic, but in a refreshingly authentic way",3,"Olivia (Madelaine Petsch, a regular from streaming series Riverdale) is a senior at an exclusive all-girls high school in an unidentified but posh-looking US suburb. Clearly hothoused from a young age by her bougie parents, Olivia’s one burning, all-consuming ambition is to get into Stanford University. To that end, she has turned herself into hard-working, top-stream student, captain of the debating society and all that jazz. She has even bought sweatshirts with the name Stanford emblazoned across the chest. But she has checked the numbers and knows that the admissions board will probably only take two or three students from her school, so there is a lot of unspoken tension between her and other students who want to attend this vastly expensive west coast university.That produces horrible pressure for these young minds, and as the film starts, one of Olivia’s best friends, Jane (Chloe Yu), has killed herself for reasons never quite made clear. When a new girl at school (Nina Bloomgarden) threatens Olivia’s supremacy of the debating society, Olivia vents about it to her old friend Izzy (singer Chlöe Bailey), also once a friend of Jane’s. Olivia and Izzy discover they have access via an old laptop to Jane’s account on a (fictional) social media platform, so they start using this ghost account to throw shade on Olivia’s rival, humiliate a teacher they don’t like, and so on. But it starts to feel as if the account is being controlled by some supernatural force, and Olivia imagines she can see Jane everywhere.Director Sabrina Jaglom, who co-wrote the screenplay with Rishi Rajani, taps into an interesting species of female neurosis turned toxic, as if she is making a mashup of Heathers, Election and Roman Polanski’s Repulsion. She ambitiously opts to keep it ambiguous throughout as to whether Olivia is losing her sanity, legitimately haunted or the instigator of a problem that she can’t control. The ending doesn’t resolve anything neatly or even satisfyingly, but there is a palpable, platonic chemistry between Petsch and Bailey as best friends turned frenemies that is authentically compelling. And it is refreshing to see a film focus so much on the complex intricacies of female relationships but that has nothing to do with sex, either between the young women themselves or with men, who barely feature here. Jane is released on 13 February on digital platforms."
Town of Strangers review – world travellers tell valuable stories in Irish town,Gort in Galway has the highest percentage of migrants in Ireland. This documentary simply lets people talk to camera – to wonderful effect,4,"Irish film-maker Treasa O’Brien has created a valuable and empathic documentary essay project about history, memory and community; it is executive produced by The Act of Killing’s Josh Oppenheimer, whose influence is detectable in one verbatim-cinema-type “dream re-enactment” scene (although I must say that this is the one creative avenue that doesn’t really go anywhere).Town of Strangers is set in the town of Gort in County Galway, perhaps best known for being the site of Coole House, the home of Lady Gregory and the Irish literary revival of Yeats, Synge, O’Casey and Shaw. None of that is mentioned, however: O’Brien focuses on its 21st-century distinction of having Ireland’s highest percentage of migrants. O’Brien auditions for people to come and be involved in her documentary, and these “audition” scenes evolve into being the central part of the film itself: where people simply talk about their lives, where they’ve come from and what they expect of Gort. We hear from Brazilian people, Syrian people, Afghan people, Irish Travellers and English hippies.This film is an invigorating, refreshing experience because of its clear-sighted compassion and lack of parochialism, its interest in other people from other cultures, without these impulses being problematised in any way. I have to say that I liked this movie almost in spite of the way it supposedly shapeshifts and genre-straddles between fiction and documentary as the marketing suggests; in fact, I don’t think it does. Despite some shots of the director doing local radio interviews about the way her film is going, it isn’t as meta as all that: its force lies in the simple candour of her interviewees. As films have so often in the past, Town of Strangers proves that there is great cinematic impact in the simple spectacle of people talking about themselves. Town of Strangers is released on 10 February in cinemas."
Blue Mountains review – brilliant Georgian shaggy-dog satire on the Soviet mindset,A welcome revival of a 1980s comedy prophesying the collapse of the Soviet Union,4,"Here is a revival of a 1983 film from the Georgian director Eldar Shengelaia (still alive at 90) and it is revealed as an intriguing, and perhaps even remarkable creation: a dapper, droll satire on Soviet bureaucracy, a shaggy dog story of absurd humour that creeps up on you, culminating in a truly bizarre apocalypse. The satire was arguably lenient enough to get the film made and lenient enough to win it the USSR State prize, but we can see from our 2023 vantage point that it is a deadpan prophecy of the Soviet Union’s imminent collapse. If we could go back in time to this film’s first release and tell Shengelaia that just six years later the Berlin Wall would come down and with it the entire Soviet system, would he have been surprised? Perhaps only about the fact that it was going to take so long.The scene is a state publishing company that also supervises printing and takes delivery of noisome chemicals in its basement courtyard. A would-be writer called Soso (Ramaz Giorgobiani) is scurrying about the building, desperately trying to interest its harassed or indolent functionaries in his novel, entitled Tian Shan, or The Blue Mountains – and therefore, we must assume, literally or metaphorically about the central Asian mountain ranges, although no one ever asks him about it or discusses literary matters in any way. No one definitively rejects him or accepts him. He is always referred to someone else.A sad, lonely man called Markscheider (Ivane Sakvarelidze), wearing a belted mac and hat like Peter Cook’s EL Wisty, is also hanging about, trying to interest people in his allegorical fables. Markscheider manages to fix the office’s broken lift – it is only when they are stranded in the frequently immobile lift that executives read manuscripts – and someone comes close to offering him a job through sheer gratitude. But not to publishing him. Another grumpy official rages at the fact that a painting of Greenland’s frozen landscape, insecurely tacked up over his desk, may come crashing down at any moment and kill him, but he cannot get the bureaucratic authority to remove it.This painting is, in fact, all he cares about; he certainly doesn’t care about literature, but then no one else does either. Another apparatchik is obsessed with the games of motorbike polo happening outside the building, and many employees spend their time gazing poignantly out of the window at the city in all its purposeful busy-ness, so different from their own near-coma of inactivity. And all the time the cracks in the walls are getting worse. It leads to an uproarious climax, delivered in the same elegantly inscrutable style as the rest of the comedy. What an intriguing and brilliant insight into the late Soviet mindset. Blue Mountains is available on 9 February on Klassiki."
I Get Knocked Down review – enjoyable blast of pop history from Chumbawamba frontman,"With a streak of humility utterly foreign to most music documentaries, Dunstan Bruce recounts the band’s successes – and failures – as pop stars and political activists",4,"As a Dr Martens-wearing teenager in the 90s, I loathed the anarchist indie band Chumbawamba and their chart-topping anthem Tubthumping. (What a bunch of jokers, I thought.) Well, I take it all back after watching this funny and surprisingly sweet documentary co-directed by frontman Dunstan Bruce and Sophie Robinson. It begins with Bruce, now in his late 50s, overwhelmed by feelings of powerlessness as he thinks about the future of the planet, wondering what he can do (“I’m a washed up, rinsed out retired radical”). As a film-maker he indulges in a bit of wallowing here: taking the negative voice in his head and bringing it to life, played by an actor wearing a papier-mache head, who sarkily takes the piss out of him.But from here the film settles nicely into an enjoyable blast of pop history. Chumbawamba started out as an anarchist collective in Leeds in 1982: living together in a squat, they went vegan (“I’m from Burnley! I didn’t like vegetables”), shared money equally and took it in turns to do the cooking. They’d been going for years when Tubthumping topped the charts. With a worldwide smash hit on their hands, the band decided that here was an opportunity to do something positive – to be a political band inside the belly of popular culture. They gave a lot of the money they made away, and in 1998 at the Brit awards, singer Danbert Nobacon poured a bucket of cold water over deputy prime minister John Prescott, furious at the Labour government’s treatment of Liverpool dockers.Chumbawamba were massive in America, and did the talkshow circuit. (“If you can’t afford our music, steal it,” said bandmate Alice Nutter on late night TV.) In the present day, Bruce interviews their big time American record label boss from that period, who says none of it changed a thing. No one was listening to the political message. “It went largely over everyone’s head.” That’s what’s so unusual about I Get Knocked Down: it has a streak of humility utterly foreign to most music documentaries. Bruce puts in the bits every other band on the planet would leave out. That includes a montage from the 90s of music critics slagging off Chumbawamba. (“They’re not very good pop stars and they’re not very good political activists either,” is the damning verdict of a young Caitlin Moran.)Chumbawamba split up in 2012. They’re still mates and come across here as extremely likable, not taking themselves at all too seriously. Scenes of them nattering together, having a giggle now, are lovely. So too are the end credits featuring clips from YouTube of ordinary people singing Tubthumping – everyone finding power and defiance in the song, from Christian choirs to heavy metal bands and small kids. I Get Knocked Down is released on 4 February in UK cinemas."
Casa Susanna review – this portrait of queer life in an era of illegality is incredibly moving,"This beautiful documentary tells the tale of a 1960s resort that offered total freedom to ‘cross-dressing men’ to be themselves. It’s a poignant, celebratory, sad story",4,"In 2004 a collection of photographs was discovered at a flea market in Manhattan. They depicted what we now know to be life at Casa Susanna (BBC Four), a bungalow camp in upstate New York that served as a resort for cross-dressing men, often accompanied by their wives. In the years since those pictures turned up, there has been a Casa Susanna book, an exhibition, a play – and now this feature-length documentary, which goes deeper into the stories of a handful of those who were there.This is a charming film with a big, open heart. Casa Susanna was established by Tito Valenti, a court translator who went by Susanna when dressed as a woman, and his wife, Maria, who owned a wig shop in Manhattan. When Maria is described by her grandson Gregory, she sounds utterly wonderful. The resort offered its patrons “total freedom” to dress as they wished. For many, it was the first time they had met anyone like them.Two now-elderly women, Katherine and Diana, spent time there in the 1960s; they return to the site and recall what it meant to them, as well as describing their lives before and after they visited. At the time they identified as transvestites or cross-dressers, though both have since transitioned. The language used around sexuality, sex and gender here may sound old-fashioned to a modern ear, but the film is guided by its interviewees’ descriptions of themselves and their friends, and has a robust complexity that gives it an honest and occasionally painful sheen. For example, we learn that this was a place for “cross-dressing men who were exclusively heterosexual”, hence the wives being there. They wanted to distinguish themselves from gay people, as they couldn’t accept what they saw as being two marks against their names.This is a very personal history for Katherine and Diana, who are generous with their life stories; a broad cultural history of gender-nonconformity; and a portrait of a specific time and place. It is a world of classified ads in specialist magazines, placed and answered in the hope of meeting like-minded souls. Diana describes being a small boy and going to sleep wishing she would wake up a girl. There was nobody to talk to about this, or no point of reference to make her feel as if she were less alone. “What could be going on with me?” she recalls thinking, bewildered and ashamed. At Casa Susanna the guests played card games and talked about themselves as they had never been able to do before.As with many portraits of queer life in an era of illegality, there is some discussion of shame. Families are tested and strained, and shame sometimes leads to cruelty and broken relationships. The documentary doesn’t flinch away from that, nor does it dwell. It does a matter-of-fact job of exploring the complicated corners, and balances the sadness with joy and celebration. This seems fitting. Pictures of the “transvestite scene” in the 1960s are understandably rare because people were afraid they might be exposed, arrested or blackmailed if they were discovered. Casa Susanna is brought to life, vibrantly, in those unearthed photographs, and it makes them all the more valuable.Diana looks through old snapshots wondering if they are really her (a couple of them, it turns out, are not). In one of the most moving and sincere moments of this very moving and sincere film, she talks about going to Mexico for what she calls “the surgery”. On the way home, a friend takes her to visit her parents for the first time as a woman. What follows is a beautiful story about love and, in the end, its limits. This heartwarming anecdote speaks to the goodness and decency of people though, as elsewhere, it does not avoid the rough edges.The film is filled with big characters. A woman named Betsy reads from a book written by her father about his time at Casa Susanna, called A Year Among the Girls; she delves into their relationship and his life with admirable frankness. Gregory serves as a de facto narrator, giving historical context to cross-dressing and transgender women, and fantastic accounts of a childhood that sounds unusual by the standards of society at the time. The end of the film brings them all together in a beautiful, poignant moment of remembering and commemoration.Sign up to What's OnGet the best TV reviews, news and exclusive features in your inbox every Mondayafter newsletter promotionThe Storyville strand is on a roll at the moment.

Still: A Michael J Fox Movie review – affecting portrait of film star’s courage,"The Back to the Future actor, whose career was ended by Parkinson’s, is movingly upbeat about his condition – but the cutesy depiction of his early life sells him short",3,"This sensitive but flawed documentary retells the inspirational story of Michael J Fox, the babyfaced Hollywood star of 80s hits including Back to the Future and TV’s Family Ties, who stunned the showbusiness world in 1998 by announcing his Parkinson’s diagnosis. It was a condition he had kept secret for seven years, having controlled it with medication and cleverly masked it on screen with his hyperactive high-energy tics, tricks and mannerisms, until the condition had deteriorated too far.The film takes us through some of his moments from the TV comedy Spin City – his final TV gig prior to going public with the diagnosis – and, heartwrenchingly, you can see how the symptoms were beginning to show. It’s an arresting watch, although in addition to dramatic reconstructions of his childhood, film-maker Davis Guggenheim has a cutesy-ironic habit of using clips from Fox’s movies themselves to dramatise key moments in Fox’s life: an unnecessary, distracting and slightly naive approach, eliding the public and private personae.Guggenheim interviews Fox and shows his daily life with his family and his personal trainer-therapist; his tremors are far more obvious when he is walking the streets than when he is sitting down talking. We also see Fox’s activism, persuading the political establishment to invest more in Parkinson’s research. In tune with the actor’s natural magnanimity, the movie does not mention the way blowhard commentator Rush Limbaugh had to apologise in 2006 for accusing Fox of exaggerating his symptoms or deliberately going off his meds for a pro-Democrat TV spot. And unlike his autobiography Lucky Man, the film does no more than hint at the sexual success that Fox enjoyed as a young star before meeting his wife, Tracy Pollan. (He memorably wrote that women who once wouldn’t give him the time of day now invited him to read it off their bedside clocks.)Fox is a thoroughly likable man, utterly without self-pity, but perhaps also without reflection: sometimes Guggenheim has to press him on how he never says he’s in pain. It could be that his natural upbeat style is his survival mechanism.What emerges from this film is how funny Fox is: the movies themselves don’t tell you that as clearly as his work on TV comedy in front of a studio audience. There is also something glorious about his rags-to-riches life story when young Fox, living in poverty in LA as a wannabe actor, first breaks up the room with his audition for the sitcom Family Ties. (He was also reliably funny doing talkshows or accepting awards.)Perhaps Fox and the film itself don’t quite put us inside his anguish at first getting the diagnosis and then his decision to go public, but his courage is the more moving for being understated. And there is a piercingly bleak moment when he says that his illness felt real to him in a way that success didn’t. I wish that his early life could have been told more simply without those ironised faux-biog clips, but this is a highly watchable and affecting film.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotion Still: A Michael J Fox Movie screened at the Sundance film festival, and is released on 12 May in cinemas and on Apple TV+."
Rewilding review – British folk horror that’s almost endearingly bad,"Taking the fashionable genre as a starting point, Ric Rawlings’ film tries to elevate amateurism in three creepy rural stories but it just looks inept",2,"Those interested in the concept of rewilding, a form of environmental conservation that seeks to restore land to a more natural state as popularised by the book by Isabella Tree, should be well advised that this film has nothing to do with that. Rather, it is an almost endearingly amateurish package, written and directed by Ric Rawlins, that is an exercise in something that’s almost as fashionable these days: folk horror. There’s lashings of folk horror about these days, some of it, like Enys Men, very good. Rewilding, however, is not very good, if we are being honest. But it’s as folky as you get, telling three disconnected stories set in the West Country and Wales revolving around such folky elements as spooky coastal caves, trees that might once have been men, and Wicker Man-esque rituals in tiny villages. Plus, there’s ersatz folk music on its soundtrack (some of it written by Rawlins himself), folk acting (as in really, really poor acting by non-professionals), and even folk editing and folk cinematography, which elevate inexperience and poor craftsmanship into an aesthetic in itself. The whole thing is very outsider cinema.Rewilding could be fun if it were either a little more inept or a little more competent, but instead it’s a bit of a chore. The first story, Stone Mothers, finds an unlucky archaeologist (John Matthews) investigating reports of the devil inside a sea cave accessible only at low tide. It gets bonus points for well-researched locations, but you have to take those back for having a protagonist so dim he never thinks to make a note of the tides, or even just install a handy app. The Family Tree finds a writer (Natasha Neckles) booking an Airbnb in a village so she can write about local trees, and finding one that bleeds and has human eyes looking through bore holes – at least, in her dreams.The final chapter, The Writers Enquiry, lacks correct punctuation in its title and any sense of logic in its ending, but at least lead Richard Chivers is a semi-competent performer, howling with energetic, almost-believable terror in the last minutes. His character is supposed to be a local reporter trying to gather ghost stories in a picturesque village for a paper that’s about to go bust. Really, hasn’t local journalism suffered enough already? Rewilding is available on now on Prime Video."
You People review – charmless Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner update,"Jonah Hill, Eddie Murphy and Julia Louis-Dreyfus star in an unfunny Netflix comedy about an interracial relationship",2,"It’s only been a couple of months since Jonah Hill won over audiences with Stutz, his sharp and surprisingly stirring documentary about his therapist, Phil Stutz. The actor is back with another contribution to the Netflix canon, this one an unfortunate monument to the unexamined life.Hill stars in, co-produced and co-wrote You People with Black-ish creator Kenya Barris. Strong as its streetwear and soundtrack game may be, the project lacks the discipline or specificity that makes a romantic comedy pop. Instead we have an updated yet out-of-date revisit of Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner by way of Meet The Parents. A nice Jewish boy and a nice Black girl like each other. A lot. And there’s the premise for the screenplay, a smorgasbord of time-killing and wannabe edgy jokes that dives headstrong into stereotypes. The whole enterprise strains to milk a relatively NBD situation for all the WTF it can.Here’s the concept, if you can call it that: Ezra (Hill) and Amira (Lauren London), meet when Ezra mistakes a woman in an idling car for his Uber driver. Amira is an underemployed costume designer on her way to a job interview, and she calls racism. The two spar, then manage to crack each other up. The two share a passion for sneakers and hip-hop – and soon, each other. Goodbye, loneliness! Hello, matching streetwear outfits! It’s sheer bliss. And then … their parents enter the picture.Ezra’s folks, Arnold and Shelley, are a pair of meddling Jews (David Duchovny and Julia Louis-Dreyfus, two of the many heavyweights in this star-studded, and star-crossed cast). They are elated when they meet their son’s new girlfriend, who is beautiful and patient and … it’s hard to say what else. Shelley is a virtue-signaling, challah-serving Jewish mom with a flair for putting her foot in her mouth, unable to stop herself from making comments about Black hair and Louis Farrakhan. “Our family is growing in such a cool and hip and funky way!” she exclaims. “We’re a family of color.”Amira’s parents, Akbar and Fatima (Eddie Murphy and Nia Long), are Black Muslims who also happen to live in the area, all the better to ratchet up the tension. They do not like the cut of Ezra’s jib, which means Shelley’s cloying embrace has a match in Akbar’s incessant razzing of Ezra. He takes the kid who wants to marry his daughter to the Black barber shop, and the basketball court, if only to watch him squirm and renounce his intentions. For her part, Shelley brings Amira to a fancy predominantly white spa.The microaggressions fly, but look past the Holocaust jokes and it’s all too evident that not much is happening beneath the surface. The overarching effect of sitting through You People is not unlike watching a Twitter timeline, staring down a smorgasbord of hot-button issues that come without the satisfaction of a through line. There are gags about vaccines, police brutality, Black Lives Matter and Yom Kippur. There is an elderly orthodontist who offers to examine Ezra’s penis. (To be fair, I cannot say I anticipated that last one.)With high-octane friends like these, you’d think the production could skate by without setting off cringe alarms. Alas, Louis-Dreyfus is unrecognizably one-note, her spunk blotted out, perhaps, by the indignity of playing a central-casting Karen. Duchovny grumbles his way along – and should be commended for taking a bite of food during a dinner scene where nobody else bothers to pretend to be eating. Mercifully, Murphy adds a dose of sharpness to the project, wrapping his lines in a delivery so sleek and spirited you’d almost think they were funny. And as for the central couple? The one that just wants to get married, culture clash be damned? They’re nice. So nice. Too nice.Their moods are determined by their parents, and it’s both disheartening and not at all surprising that their parents are the ones who engineer the couple’s inevitable late-second-act rupture and third-act redemption. Strong as their shared fondness for tie-dye athleisure may be, the two members of the couple lack agency, and, more unfortunately, an actual connection. It calls back to a moment in Stutz where Hill tells his therapist that he has a disease: “I have to avoid emotion by making jokes.”For all its insistence that it’s a daring piece of social commentary, You People is, above all, a romance without a beating heart.You People is now available on Netflix"
"Pamela, A Love Story review – Pamela Anderson looks back in all innocence","The Baywatch star comes across as a very likable personality in this elusive documentary that casts its eyes over her past life, sex tape and all",3,"Gentle, friendly, faintly bleary – and sans makeup – Pamela Anderson is an authentically likable screen presence in this intimate, if somehow elusive, documentary portrait from Ryan White; it is about her life and times and the super-strength misogyny she has faced from liberals and satirists in the long endgame of her celebrity career. (This, incidentally, is yet another documentary which shows how very badly talkshow monologues can date.)Anderson is interviewed at her lakeside property in Canada, musing wryly and shrewdly about the media, often hanging out on camera with her two grownup sons who are fiercely fond and protective. The movie uses her sweetly innocent diaries and her home videos with badass ex-husband Tommy Lee, from which the notorious sex tape was pirated and sold, helping to fuel the world wide web in its early dial-up era.We are taken through her backstory: her explosively tempered, proto-Tommy dad who was always fighting with her mom, her abuse and rape as a child, her sensational “discovery” in the crowd by the jumbotron camera at a football game, her Norma Jeane/Marilyn transformation into a blonde icon eerily unlike her former un-star self, her Playboy covers, her ascent to global celebrity on TV’s Baywatch, her marriage on the beach to Mötley Crüe drummer Lee after just four days’ acquaintance. And then the still unsolved theft of the honeymoon sex tape, which made them a global laughing stock, and which many male commentators took as their green light to convert the lechery into hate (but perhaps it was always hate).This documentary shows that she had to contend with obnoxious abuse (including physical abuse) throughout her life. TV comics and pundits thought they were punching up, including the reliably boorish and objectionable Larry King. Anderson is candid about the string of failed marriages and relationships she endured – although we don’t hear about the one with Jon Peters – and says they were all a desperate attempt to recapture the rocket-fuelled excitement of that first, gloriously romantic and outrageous wedding to Lee.And as for that sex tape, Pamela angrily says she never made a dime out of it and rejects the theory that she somehow was behind the leaking. I believe her, but I’d like to see some closer questioning of Lee on this point. As for the rest of it, such as her friendship with Julian Assange … well she hasn’t much to say about that, or if they are still in touch. Her campaign work for Peta? Audacious and admirable, but it isn’t clear if she’s still involved.Anderson finally gets cast in Chicago on Broadway as Roxie Hart and does very well. She’s a really good dancer, and there’s redemption there, of a sort. Will she carry on in musical theatre? That would be a great move: she deserves happiness, and perhaps this would bring it to her. Pamela, A Love Story is released on 31 January on Netflix."
Pathaan review – daft Shah Rukh Khan spy caper is more fun than Bond,The Bollywood megastar plays an unfeasibly ripped agent brought out of retirement to foil the fiendish terror plots of Outfit X,3,"This enjoyable high-octane action spy movie from India is possibly the most fun you can currently have at the cinema – for the first two hours of its running time at least. At the packed London cinema where I watched it on opening night, the crowd erupted with whoops the moment Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan appeared on screen – face battered to a pulp, gazing up through a bloody swollen half-shut eye.The film is the latest instalment in the YRF Spy Universe: Khan is Pathaan, a James Bond-ish spy brought out of retirement to take down an international terror organisation known as Outfit X. Its leader is another former Indian spy, Jim (John Abraham), who’s gone rogue, committing atrocities for the likes of Boko Haram and Islamic State in return for cash. Now Jim has got his hands on a biological weapon of mass destruction.The increasingly daft plot pings around the globe like a Bond or Mission: Impossible. Khan delivers a performance with perfect levels of fun, and light on Bond-ish psychological flaws, playing it instead with a wink here, a joke there. (There’s a very funny line about him going to the hairdressers to get a blow dry.) Saying that, Khan clearly takes his training seriously; he’s impossibly ripped, and his personal trainer probably deserves to share his credits and a chunk of his fee here.The film sags a little towards the end, with a few too many implausible action sequences: characters jumping out of helicopters and fighting on top of speeding SUVs, the choreography glossing over the basics of gravity and physics. Still, the cheers kept coming: the loudest whoop of all when Salman Khan made an entrance as Tiger, a hero from an earlier movie in the series. Pathaan is out now in UK cinemas."
Infinity Pool review – a holiday turns hellish in full-on thriller,Sundance film festival: Brandon Cronenberg continues following in his father David’s footsteps with a violent eye-opener about extreme hedonism,3,"During the darkest days of the pandemic, there was a universal hankering for escape, from the grimness of the unendingly awful news and also from our homes, another country suddenly seeming more like another world. When stringent protocols had a financial and logistical impact on production, stories that took place in relatively remote locations with relatively small casts started to propagate. But what’s interesting about so many of them, from The Menu to Glass Onion to Triangle of Sadness to Fall to The White Lotus and now to Infinity Pool, is that the majority end up warping our desire to get away, cautionary tales of death and danger imploring us to stay home in order to survive.Brandon Cronenberg’s thriller of lurid, and at times laughable, extremities takes us to a swish resort in the fictional state of Li Tolqa, an isolated idyll that lures writer James (Alexander Skarsgård) with his wife Em (Cleopatra Coleman). His last book was six years ago and he’s hoping to be inspired by the new surroundings. Instead inspiration comes from flirtatious actor Gabi (Mia Goth) and her architect husband Alban (Jalil Lespert) who take James under their wing.You don’t have to be familiar with Goth’s recent fascination with high-pitch horror to know that this is not a couple to be trusted but James is seduced by their freewheeling nature and her wandering hand (an early scene of her masturbating him after he urinates is a shockingly graphic sign of things to come). But questions over fidelity are tabled when a drunk-driving accident sends James and Em to a local jail where an unlikely proposition is suggested. The punishment for the crime is execution but if James can afford it, a clone can be created, with all of his memories as well as his physicality, and he can be killed instead.While Em is traumatised by the sight of her husband’s clone getting enthusiastically stabbed to death (again, shockingly graphic), James is weirdly compelled and finds himself part of a small group of tourists who have also gone through the same experience as him. Their time in Li Tolqa is dominated by hedonistic indulgence, pushing each other to wild levels of depravity and James must figure out how far he’s willing to go.As with his last film, the Andrea Riseborough-starring Possessor, Cronenberg has fostered his father David’s interest in boundary-pushing body horror, pummeling his characters and us with gore and gristle. It’s effectively eye-opening and confidently choreographed but always at a remove, Skarsgård allured a little too quickly into indulging in terrible things. It is interesting to see him continue to trade in his conventional leading man looks for another bizarro role, this one pushing him further than we’ve seen him pushed before, from fighting himself while naked to getting breastfed by Goth, an actor who is again admirably committed, another capitalised go-for-broke performance. It’s not always successful but it’s hard to keep your eyes off her as she slinks her way into chaos.There’s some initial unease over how the locals are portrayed – as mystical and uncivilised – but the script soon reveals that it’s the tourists who are the true barbarians, treating their surroundings with callous contempt, the film another addition to the recent string of one-percenter skewering satires. For a film filled with provocative and punishing imagery, it’s remarkable how little of it actually sticks in one’s mind once the credits roll. The “more is more” approach (hallucinations, orgies, pissing, stabbing, shooting, splitting, piercing etc) is attention-securing in the moment but oddly forgettable after, like waking up from a nightmare you can’t remember. Infinity Pool is too hectic to truly haunt.Infinity Pool premiered at the Sundance film festival and will be released in US cinemas on 27 January and in the UK on 24 March"
Shadow Master review – martial arts meet dark arts in ultraviolent horror sci-fi,"Someone or something is abducting children from an asylum. Step forward the new nightwatchman, a martial arts star battling demonic voices ordering him to kill. Cue mayhem",2,"This pulpy, ultraviolent horror-sci-fi-action whatnot of a film seems to unfold in a post-apocalyptic end-time – or maybe just a very rough suburb of Los Angeles. It’s hard to tell, nor does it much matter. Whatever the context, this is a world where it’s always night, where colours are so desaturated that everything’s a kind of slushy orangey brown, everybody has unkempt hair or dreads, and the borders between the spirit world and that of the living are somewhat porous.A young man named Voaen (played by martial arts champ DY Sao) arrives to take a night watchman job at a crusty squat which is in fact some sort of asylum for families with sick family members. After introductions to the many and varied residents, Voaen makes doe eyes with Janett (Luciana Faulhaber), a pretty mother with a young wheelchair-using son – but it’s hard to fathom the depths of their feelings for one another under all that hair. Someone or something is abducting children, so everybody is a bit jumpy. The multi-ethnic cast mention all kinds of deities and theological beliefs, from Hanuman the monkey god to four apocalyptic horseman to someone named Mephisto. The costumes and makeup are similarly elaborate and eclectic, a mixture of armour, nail extensions, decorated beekeeping hats and (the meme of the moment these days) medieval plague doctor masks.Voaen has a near-death experience and discovers that some kind of god/demonic force is trying to use him as an instrument of its nefarious aims. At the same time, the residents of the asylum are hoping that he can call on his past history of violence (shown in a flurry of fighting flashbacks) to protect the weak. As Voaen tries to perform his rounds at the facility he keeps hearing the subsonic grumble of the demon’s voice which (as far as I can make out in the super-muddy sound mix) are mostly commands to kill – though maybe it’s a grocery list. Judging by the soundtrack, the shouting and hysteria escalate, but it’s hard to tell what’s going on in all that murk. Shadowy it is indeed, but mastery is more questionable. Shadow Master is released on 30 January on digital platforms."
Theater Camp review – lackluster musical theater comedy falls flat,Sundance film festival: mockumentary set at an upstate musical theater camp feels like an extended inside joke,2,"For all the grand gestures of musical theater, there’s an odd flatness to Theater Camp, a half-hearted and lackluster comedy from a group of Hollywood friends set at a summer performing arts community. There’s the inherited, well-worn genre of the mockumentary, as well as the familiar satirical targets of overzealous and/or pretentious theater types. But the real remove comes from a script that must’ve seemed much funnier on paper than in practice.The 94-minute film “literally came out of us just wanting to make something with our friends”, said Molly Gordon, co-director along with her boyfriend Nick Lieberman, after the film’s overhyped Sundance standing ovation. That’s pretty accurate to how it feels to watch Theater Camp – secondhand comedy, as if sitting in on a friend group’s exchange of inside jokes you’re not privy to, with unoriginal bits that probably kill among their audience but fizzle on screen.Theater Camp, written by Gordon, Lieberman and their friends/former Evan Hansens/engaged couple Ben Platt and Noah Galvin, expands upon the group’s 2020 short of the same name. Like the original, it stars Platt and Gordon as daffily over-serious theater camp instructors captured by an unseen documentary crew, this time brought to a bespoke upstate musical arts camp called AdirondACTS. The lakeside community is in turmoil after its cash-strapped matriarch Joan (Amy Sedaris) slips into a strobe-light induced coma at a middle school production of Bye Bye Birdie; her vlogger son Troy (YouTube star Jimmy Tatro), an overdrawn caricature of a social media hypeman, steps in to “en-troy-preneur” the place with zero knowledge of musical theater. (One of the film’s better bits is the camp’s consistent invocation of Joan as a beloved departed spirit when she’s still alive.)The plot loosely orbits around co-dependent best friends Amos (Platt) and Rebecca-Diane’s (Gordon) splintering relationship as they compose an original musical about Joan’s legacy (the film’s best decision, by far, is to show us several minutes of the completed Joan, Still) and Troy’s airheaded attempts to keep the place afloat. There’s a brief side plot involving the ruthless, deadpan board member of the neighboring camp (played by the always funny Patti Harrison) who sees an opportunity for expansion, and the general extra-ness of the camp’s many personalities, including dance instructor Clive (Nathan Lee Graham) and biting costume designer Gigi (Owen Thiele). Galvin is the standout of the adult cast, imbuing a spotlight-yearning “third-generation stage manager” with anxious heart that has rewarding payoff in the film’s genuinely enjoyable, sentimental musical finale. (Ayo Edebiri, playing to awkward type, also steals the spotlight in a handful of scenes as a completely underqualified local hired to cut costs.)The film-makers appear to have a skewed sense of what would make their film – a promising premise always ripe for parody – enjoyable. The most glaring example is the format; the genre of the mockumentary is already overdone, and Theater Camp halfway commits to it in the least helpful way – the camera is shaky, the edit distractingly jittery and the shots unnecessarily finagled through blinds or door cracks. There’s no fourth-wall breaking or talking heads, which usually provide the zings for this type of set-up. The visual language is generally chaotic and at times incoherent, but not in a way that underscores the playful cacophony of a summer camp. The mismatched aesthetic is further muddled by the film’s desaturated color palette for a grainy, muted texture – a choice that undermines rather than amplifies the excess of the characters and the general heightened intensity of a musical theater camp for very enthusiastic kids. (For a mockumentary that does elevate the campiness of youth theater and is actually funny, see: High School Musical: The Musical: The Series.)And despite all the star power, I wished the film would focus not on the typically self-obsessed adults – I enjoy Gordon as a performer, but there’s nothing new in her parody of a seance-y, “energy-healing” white woman – but on the numerous talented youth actors seemingly thrilled to be there and all fun to watch. Theater Camp does, at least, reward us at the end with the kids’ performance of Joan, Still, which has all the warm, earnest charm the previous 80 minutes lacked. Easily the best punchline of Theater Camp is that the much-beleaguered, obviously tasteless production of Joan, Still is actually good, in the ridiculous, bad but deeply committed way. It’s not enough to make up for the film around it, but a good reminder of the intense belonging theater camp can evoke, and what a self-aware film about it could’ve been.Theater Camp premiered at the Sundance film festival and is seeking distribution"
January review – Pinteresque winter’s tale in wolf-filled Bulgarian badlands,Andrey Paounov’s opaque but arresting feature turns on mysterious disappearances and wolfish arrivals in a deep dark forest,3,"Here’s a bitter, odd, quirky shaggy-dog ghost story with a wintry chill. Award-winning Bulgarian documentary film-maker Andrey Paounov makes his fiction feature debut with this adaption, along with British co-writer Alex Barrett, from a stage play by Bulgarian author Yordan Radichkov. Two middle-aged men are shivering in a remote snowy hut just on the border of a dark forest full of wolves. They are the Porter (Samuel Finzi) and the Old Man (Iossif Surchadzhiev), and they are … what? Forest rangers? Officials at a science research station? A third resident, Petar, has gone into town earlier, taking with him the horse-and-sled and his rifle.While Petar is away, a sinisterly threatening man (Zachary Baharov) shows up with another man whose face is obscured by scarves, demanding help with his damaged snow plough. An aggressive priest (Leonid Yovchev) also arrives, demanding to know where Petar is. But then Petar’s horse returns, without Petar, and with a frozen wolf in the back of the sled. One by one, the visitors insist on taking the horse-and-sled through the forest into town, and each time, the horse comes placidly clip-clopping back, with no human there – just another frozen wolf in the back.This weird little parable looks a bit like a middle-European Pinter, or a sketch of the eastern European mind paralysed by the ghost of Soviet communism. But then it takes a bizarre left-turn, switching from black-and-white to colour, pastiching Kubrick’s The Shining. Why? I don’t know. It’s not a particularly successful idea, and in fact undermines the distinctive identity of the rest of the film. But Paounov maintains the movie’s intense fixity of mood, and the effect is arresting. January is released on 27 January in cinemas and on digital platforms."
Renegades review – veteran musclemen team up for ‘geri-action’ caper,"Nick Moran and Lee ‘Six Million Dollar Man’ Majors are the star names in this UK thriller, but they are let down by inept action sequences and stilted banter",2,"Cheap as undercooked chips, this British thriller about elderly ex-soldiers avenging a friend’s death belatedly cashes in on the 2010s trend for “geri-action” films, to borrow a term coined by Vulture’s Matt Patches. Though less slick, it resembles those American fisticuff- and gunfire-packed thrillers (the Red and Expendables franchises, for example) built around former big-name actors supplementing their pension schemes.Directed by Daniel Zirilli, the film features Nick Moran (still best known for Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels) as the low-profile protagonist, Burton, a former SAS man suffering from PTSD. He gets scooped up on the street by an old acquaintance, American veteran Carver (former Six Million Dollar Man Lee Majors), who has a beef with some gangsters in his London neighbourhood who are trafficking women, selling drugs and, given the age of everyone here, possibly dealing in black market ration cards.When Carver fails to subdue the ruffians, Burton and a cohort of buddies (Ian Ogilvy, Billy Murray and Paul Barber) band together to take out the trash, with assists from nice gangster Sanchez (Danny Trejo), Carver’s politician daughter Judy (Patsy Kensit) and a few cops.At the very least, viewers would expect a little witty banter to pad out the time between action sequences, the latter being typically inept and low-energy. Unfortunately, the dialogue sounds as if it was written by one of those newfangled AI chatbots, or maybe an actual human being who aspires to write as well as an AI chatbot but is not there yet. Renegades is released on 30 January on digital platforms."
Transfusion review – paint-by-numbers drama could be written by AI,"Decent acting from Sam Worthington and Phoebe Tonkin can’t save this moody action flick from a lacklustre script, which contains no surprises",2,"Sam Worthington spends lots of time looking intensely glum in Transfusion, matching the tone of the writer/director Matt Nable’s quietly moody action-drama. You can’t blame the guy: not long ago Worthington was swimming in shimmering oceans on a picturesque planet populated by lanky smurfs. Now, in this sombre Stan original film, Worthington plays Ryan Logan, a former sniper for the Australian Army who is struggling to adjust to normal society. He starts selling wine he knows nothing about before getting in over his head, entangled in a narrative reminiscent of a Liam Neeson B-thriller.The film’s first scene establishes Ryan’s backstory: a mission in Iraq injured him both physically and psychologically. The second provides some father-son camaraderie: Ryan has a very macho bonding scene with eight-year-old Billy (Gilbert Bradman), as the pair hunt for deer. The third reveals Ryan’s softer side, as he hangs out with his pregnant wife Justine (Phoebe Tonkin) and responds to questions from Billy such as: “Can I be brave like you one day?” To be fair, that line reads cheesier than it sounds: this interaction – the entire film, in fact – is decently acted, despite some lacklustre scripting.Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningThe key issue with these introductory scenes isn’t the acting, or the direction, but the machine-tooled nature of the writing. You know it’s all a setup to show us what’s important to Ryan before Nable pulls the rug out from under him. When Justine is killed in a car crash early on, the moment feels so rote, so mechanical, that it is robbed of any genuine emotion. Did we just watch a person die, or a page in the script marked “end of prologue”?The narrative jumps ahead: Billy is now 16 (Edward Carmody) and a teenage delinquent. A judge lets him off with a warning, instructing him to keep on the straight and narrow or he’ll be removed from Ryan’s care.Again the setup is obvious: you know the boy is going to get in trouble. And when a former SAS colleague, Johnny (Nable, also acting), comes along offering some easy, albeit illegal, work, you know the opposite is true: working for Johnny is going to be difficult and precarious, and we know Ryan will end up putting everything on the line for himself and his son.In an era of rapidly advancing artificial intelligence, such as the game-changing AI ChatGPT, it’s only a matter of time until we could truly suspect these sorts of paint-by-numbers scripts were spat out by computer – or that the computer might do a better job.An inevitable mishap involving Billy sends Ryan scurrying into a life of crime in order to get money – because formula, because algorithm, because he’s going to get In Over His Head. Even the film’s most surreal flourish is deeply templated: the posthumous presence of Justine, who as a ghost (or a vision in Ryan’s head), encourages him to make better decisions; the old “angel on his shoulder” chestnut.Sign up to Saved for LaterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsafter newsletter promotionThese moments, again, to the credit of the actors and Nable’s direction, aren’t very compelling but they don’t feel clumsy, even suiting the film’s downcast atmosphere. And downcast it surely is: there’s lots of stern looks in Transfusion, along with a lot of bad decisions and tough-talking men. The film is supposed to be dramatically engaging rather than pleasurable – but it’s only occasionally the former.Transfusion is available to stream on Stan now, and is released on 23 January in the UK on digital platforms"
Babylon review – Brad Pitt suaves through a grand hymn to golden age Hollywood,"Pitt and Margot Robbie, and many razzle dazzle setpieces, help lift a story in no hurry to engage with the true-life nastiness of its era",3,"With this turbo-charged and heavy handed epic, Damien Chazelle returns to that tinsel town movie world where he made his breakthrough with 2016’s Oscar-winning La La Land. This one is all about the chaos and excess of 1920s silent era Hollywood, a topic it approaches by being stridently chaotic and excessive.It’s a love letter to the movies, inevitably – though I remember Chazelle’s previous films being love letters to actual human beings. Chazelle is concerned to restore some of the minorities who have been erased in Hollywood’s heterosexual history, but he really fudges the new #MeToo conversation about the Hollywood golden age. All the raunchy sex here is very much consensual. And those outrageous party scenes, with the mandatory overhead shots showing the ecstatically unclothed women crowd-surfing face-up … they’re so much like Baz Luhrmann he should be getting a royalty cheque.Various stock characters swirl around in the movie madness: Brad Pitt plays Jack Conrad, a handsome much-married leading man of a certain age in the John Gilbert mould, whose career is on the slide, concealing his boozy ennui with a veneer of genial suavity. Li Jun Li is stylish and charismatic in the role of Lady Fay Zhu, a gay club singer perhaps inspired by Anna May Wong. Jovan Adepo is Sidney Palmer, a brilliant African American jazz trumpeter who is finally given some onscreen time in the talkies, at the expense of racist “blackface” humiliation in the wake of Al Jolson’s success with The Jazz Singer.But most importantly there is Margot Robbie playing Nellie LaRoy, an obsessive wannabe It girl in the style of Evelyn Nesbit or Clara Bow. She impresses everyone with her ability to cry on cue, but needs some elocution lessons from Hedda-and-Louella-type gossip hack Elinor St John (Jean Smart), a haughty Brit working a Henry Higgins side-hustle. Relative newcomer Diego Calva plays Manny Torres, the moviestruck Mexican kid who gets a job on Jack’s location shoot, rises up the studio food chain, pretends to be from Spain to avoid anti-Mexican bigotry and is secretly in love with Nellie.There are plenty of great scenes here: particularly an outrageous set-piece in which Nellie fights a rattlesnake in the desert after one of the many orgiastic parties, a contest which leads to a very erotic encounter with Lady Fay Zhu. Most staggeringly, we have Manny wrangling an elephant to be delivered to a colossally decadent party, where there is to be a Roscoe Arbuckle-style crisis. One plutocrat, doing drugs and pervy activity with a young woman in a private room, panics when she loses consciousness and he and his hard-faced minders use the elephant as a diversionary tactic. The question of rape (which fuelled the actual Arbuckle case, of which he was eventually exonerated), does not feature, although the movie slightly swerves the question of whether this fictional woman recovers or not. It has to be said that the traumatised secret suffered by all It girls from real-life Hollywood tended to be not that they had a quaintly imagined gambling habit (as Nellie has) but that they had been sexually abused by their employers.Babylon is a film that’s thinking big, aiming big, acting big – but feeling small, and finally ordering us to care about the celluloid magic, a secondary emotional response that should be happening without any explicit instruction. Yet it’s always a pleasure to be in the presence of such blackbelt movie stars as Pitt and Robbie and there is something funny in Babylon’s absurd event-movie gigantism.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotion Babylon is released on 23 December in the US, and on 20 January in the UK."
Missing review – Searching sequel offers more laptop-based thrills,"Euphoria’s Storm Reid makes for a compelling detective in an inventive, if increasingly far-fetched and overly sentimental, follow-up to the 2018 mystery",3,"It seemed, for a brief moment, that film-makers had crafted an entirely new way of watching a thriller back in the mid-2010s. After the found footage boom had started to lose audiences and all sense of logic (if you didn’t scream “why the hell are you still filming?” at a screen in that era then you really didn’t live), an even cheaper-to-produce subgenre emerged, replacing a shaky cam with one that never even moves at all. Films such as Unfriended, Open Windows and The Den took place entirely on someone’s laptop screen, a cyber-horror update that was supposed to resonate with an audience whose lives also did the same.But it wasn’t until a few years later, in 2018, when Aneesh Chaganty’s nifty debut Searching truly maximised the new medium, focusing less on demons and more on detectives. His film saw a single dad, played by John Cho, desperately search for help online to track down his missing daughter. A mystery was solved in ways that we often solve lesser mysteries ourselves, with internet assistance. It was a deserved hit but five years later, when we’re even further from what ended up being less a big new trend and more a tiny blip, a spin-off/sequel lands in cinemas, audience interest to be determined.Missing tells a similar story – a strained parent-daughter relationship, a baffling disappearance, all unfolding on a MacBook – but, as is often the case with sequels, ups the ante considerably with newer tech, bigger twists and wider world-building. The characters are unrelated to those in the original but there are ties (the lead watches a Netflix series based on what happened) and other Easter eggs for those invested enough to look for them.The dynamic has also flipped this time around with daughter (Euphoria’s Storm Reid) looking for parent (Nia Long, having a welcome moment with this and The Best Man series on Peacock), who heads on vacation with her boyfriend (Industry’s Ken Leung) and doesn’t come back. The shift in perspective means that jokes at the expense of a father’s tech shortcomings are replaced with mostly hyper-competence, a teen flexing her digital muscles as she marches her way into an online rabbit hole, fully armed. Searching’s editors turned Missing’s writer-directors Nick Johnson and Will Merrick are keenly aware that five years is more like 50 in tech so there’s less reliance on Skype and more appearances of TikTok.Like the first, it’s propulsive and involving and, at times, genuinely innovative but in upgrading our lead to someone who is that much more skilled behind a keyboard, the film relies on scenes of extreme intelligence often directly followed by scenes of staggering stupidity in order to keep certain developments under wraps. Reid is a compelling and commanding protagonist and the makers understandably want us to see more of her but that often means that she just happens to keep leaving on her webcam or her FaceTime just so we, the audience, can see her react. Moments of far-fetched, sigh-at-the-screen incredulity are also met by an overdose of sentimentality, something that felt less gloopy in the original, which was more elegant in its estranged parent-daughter drama. Brevity is always a welcome quality for a B-movie such as this and at almost two hours, the flaws of Missing are given too much space to distract.But sighs at incongruously dumb behaviour and groans at the family soap are eventually drowned out by audible gasps at some of the wild twists, the kind that might not make much sense on reflection but do deliver cattle-prod shocks along the way. Missing might not make a strong enough case for the subgenre at large to return (talk of Unfriended 3 has been mercifully muted) but it’s entertaining enough to show that this particular series does have more battery life.Missing is out 20 January in US cinemas, 26 January in Australia, and on 21 April in UK cinemas."
"Alice, Darling review – Anna Kendrick excels in abusive relationship thriller","Kendrick impresses as a woman being deprived of emotional oxygen by a toxic boyfriend, though Mary Nighy’s film gets distracted by a subplot",3,"Anna Kendrick gives a vehement, self-aware lead performance in this Gaslight-style suspense drama about a young woman trapped in a coercive, abusive relationship from screenwriter Alanna Francis and debut feature director Mary Nighy. There are some edge-of-the-seat moments and interestingly subtle tonal inflexions, though the story spends time on a contrived subplot about a missing girl, time that might have been better devoted to developing the central thriller storyline.Alice (Kendrick) is in a toxic relationship with Simon (Charlie Carrick), an arrogant, controlling man with an uncertain career as an artist, in constant need of reassurance and always tracking Alice’s movements. When Alice is allowed out for a rare evening at a bar with her two best friends Tess (Kaniehtiio Horn) and Sophie (Wunmi Mosaku), we can see how glassy-eyed Alice’s smile is, how tensely distracted, how she flinches at each ping from her phone. She is no longer the vivacious friend Tess and Sophie once knew and loved; she appears to have issues with food and her hair is thin.Francis’s script allows us to notice that her friend Tess is also an artist (but less successful than obnoxious, strutting Simon), and we can see the queasy irony in Alice having possibly met Simon in Tess’s circle, and how he is coldly taking her away from them. Tensely aware that Simon won’t like it, Alice accepts an invitation to go away on a vacation with Tess and Sophie but tells him it’s a work trip she can’t get out of. How long will Simon be fooled by that?Kendrick is capable of creating an arrhythmic heartbeat of tension and fear in her screen presence: this is someone who is gradually being deprived of emotional oxygen. But sometimes the tendons in the script go slack – and there is also something here which doesn’t quite allow the relationship between Alice and her friends, and relationship of Tess and Sophie with each other, to become fully three-dimensional. Well, it’s a very strong performance from Kendrick, who disturbingly conveys the tiny and not so tiny symptoms of emotional abuse. Alice, Darling is released on 20 January in cinemas in the US and UK with an Australian release date to be confirmed.

M3gan review – top-of-the-range murderous teen robot,This enjoyable horror-lite romp follows in the killer doll footsteps of Chucky and Annabelle ,4,"M3gan is the ultimate prestige toy: a precision-engineered prototype cyborg doll with limpid blue eyes and the capacity to learn from and empathise with her “primary user”. She comes with a price tag that would buy you a midsized family car, a full gamut of judgmental tweenager eye rolls and a taste for casual slaughter. And right now, she’s a lifeline for her creator, robotics engineer Gemma (Allison Williams). Following the deaths of her sister and brother-in-law, Gemma finds herself caring for her traumatised eight-year-old niece, Cady (Violet McGraw). It’s a job that Gemma is only too happy to outsource to Frankenstein’s 4ft devil Barbie, a decision that comes back to bite her (and to attack her with a hammer).The latest addition to the killer doll genre, M3gan is an enjoyable horror-lite romp: knowing, amusing, but not particularly scary. But while the psychotically perky robot might not have the chaotic energy of Chucky from the Child’s Play franchise or the porcelain malevolence of Annabelle, she does bring a pleasing TikTok-friendly pizazz to her killing rampages. I suspect we’ll be seeing a lot more of the murder toy of the moment."
Enys Men review – Mark Jenkin’s Cornish psychodrama will sweep you away,A lone wildlife volunteer on an island off the coast of Cornwall is haunted by the past and the landscape in the writer-director’s spellbinding follow-up to Bait,5,"Film-maker Mark Jenkin originally intended to brand his superbly haunting follow-up to Bait (2019) as “a lost Cornish folk horror” film. He was persuaded to drop most of those descriptions: Enys Men isn’t lost (although it does feel like a recently unearthed magical relic from another era); it isn’t really horror (despite that ultra-creepy trailer); and the word “folk” is oddly misleading. That left “a Cornish film” – a simple phrase that perfectly encapsulates the myriad mysteries soaked into the dreamy, tactile landscape of this handmade gem. I could tell you that Enys Men (which means Stone Island) is Shirley Jackson’s The Haunting of Hill House as reimagined by the ghost of Nic Roeg; that it’s the cult 70s TV frightener The Stone Tape reconfigured through the inspirational prism of playwright and environmental activist Nick Darke; or that it owes more to the Japanese chiller Onibaba than to the “unholy trinity” of British folk-horror (Witchfinder General, The Blood on Satan’s Claw and The Wicker Man). But the more I think about it, the more “a Cornish film” says it all.It’s easier to describe Enys Men in terms of colour (red and yellow are primal elements) than plot, since its distinct brand of clockwork-cranked, luxuriously saturated cinematic poetry is supremely resistant to precis. Suffice to say that it plays out on an island off the Cornish coast in the days before May Day, 1973. Mary Woodvine is quietly mesmerising as the unnamed volunteer stationed alone on the island, although as she says: “I’m not on my own.” Her life is ritual: walking the rugged cliffs, taking temperature readings around an outcrop of rare flowers; listening to a stone drop down a mineshaft; writing the day’s findings (“no change”) in her botanical diary. Back at the cottage, she fires up the growling generator (fuel supplies are low), makes the tea (also running out), and takes to bed with a copy of A Blueprint for Survival, an environmentalist text whose cover is emblazoned with the promise that after reading it “nothing quite seems the same any more”. The same could be said of this film.The volunteer’s primary connection with the mainland is via radio, a mysterious medium (whether VHF transmitter or Dansette transistor) that conjures voices like spirits in a seance: fragmented conversations with a distant presence (“are you there?”); a distress signal (“Mayday! Mayday!”) from a wreck foretold; the heart-piercing voice of Brenda Wootton singing The Bristol Christ (from a poem by Cornish bard Charles Causley).Meanwhile, the island seems to breathe the history of Cornwall – from the miners still haunting the darkened shafts below, to the Bal Maidens stomping the ground above, and the children who sing outside the volunteer’s cottage. Presiding over this time-slipping strangeness is a giant standing stone with a profound living-rock connection to the volunteer. No wonder the lichen that appears on those rare flowers also colonises her body, linking us back to an earlier trauma, played out in tantalising form by the enigmatic Flo Crowe.In his current BFI season The Cinematic DNA of Enys Men, Jenkin juxtaposes the Cornish-set Children’s Film Foundation production Haunters of the Deep with the Australian eco-chiller Long Weekend (“their crime was against nature!”) and José Ramón Larraz’s atmospheric British psychodrama Symptoms. But it’s Lawrence Gordon Clark’s Stigma, made in 1977 as part of the BBC’s A Ghost Story for Christmas series, that offers the most intriguing touchstone, sharing with Enys Men an atmosphere of uncanny weirdness, closely aligned with the writings of MR James, or John Wyndham.Some will be left confused – even frustrated – by a narrative that slips dextrously between dreams and reality (Lost Highway is also in that BFI season). Indeed, in one scene the volunteer burns her hand on a stove to bring herself back to the “now”, to the “real”. Such endeavours are self-defeating; better simply to let Enys Men drown you in its intensely sensory spell; to feel it rather than watch it.What Enys Men “means” will differ for each viewer. For me, it is (like Bait) a richly authentic portrait of Cornwall, far removed from any tourist-friendly vision – a land defined by rugged industry (those miners are still down below), locked in an elemental struggle with the sea (a force that can both give and take life) and driven by a palpable sense of the past underpinning the future. I’ve seen the film three times so far, and I can’t wait to dive into it and be swept away again. Bravo!"
Tár review – Cate Blanchett dazzles as monstrous maestro,"Todd Field’s masterly film echoes the slippery genius of its protagonist, a brilliant conductor-composer who toys with her admirers",5,"The genius of Todd Field’s superb Tár comes from the way the film-making echoes the treacherously seductive and mercurial nature of its central character. Lydia Tár (an electrifying Cate Blanchett) is a dazzling talent: a world-class conductor and composer with a towering ego to match her formidable professional reputation. She describes herself, in a rare, entirely insincere moment of self-deprecation, as “a U-haul lesbian”, but in fact she is one half of a Berlin Philharmonic power couple: her partner is the lead violinist, Sharon Goodnow (Nina Hoss).Tár is magnificent. At the same time she’s a monster, a capricious narcissist who charms a series of young women, all rising stars in classical music, who subsequently find their careers stymied when they fly too close to the blistering heat of her self-regard.Field (Oscar nominated for his two previous films, Little Children and In the Bedroom) brings a slippery complexity to proceedings. Is Tár the slow-motion car crash of a cancellation? The crash and burn of hubristic ambition? A supernatural thriller? A Shakespearean tragedy about a powerful individual driven to the brink of madness by the niggling attrition of guilt? There’s also a mean-spirited crackle of humour here and there.It’s a phenomenal picture, supported by top-tier crew, from Bina Daigeler’s costumes (Tár’s tailored suits are a kind of intellectual armour) to Florian Hoffmeister’s lithe camerawork, which captures symphonies of discomfort in the musicians, starting in the string section with a stricken, shamed Sharon, and answered by a flutter of uncertainty that spreads through the orchestra like a scurrilous rumour."
Plane review – Gerard Butler’s rickety thriller never takes off,The actor plays a pilot tasked with an emergency landing and then an island full of criminals in a B-movie that needs some more thrills,2,"One of the many reasons schlock horror M3gan become such a surprise critical darling last week was down to Universal’s crafty release strategy, sashaying into the otherwise dead zone of January, easily leaping over an extremely low bar. This week reminds us of what the month usually offers US cinema-goers – an unwanted comedy remake, a horror film for Christians and a Gerard Butler action thriller – junk that’s easy for the studios to dump and even easier for audiences to forget.Already the subject of social media jabs because of its ridiculous title, the Butler of it all, a film about a plane called Plane, is a January movie through and through, filling empty screens just because they need filling, doing the least but at an aggressively loud volume. There have certainly been worse B-movies released in this most cursed of months (last year’s kidnapped mermaid saga The King’s Daughter and 2020’s staggeringly, almost satirically, incompetent Blake Lively thriller The Rhythm Section spring to mind) but there have also recently been far better (slay M3gan slay etc) and as such, Plane doesn’t exactly rise above that low bar but sort of meets it head-on.For a film called Plane, there’s really not as much plane as one would hope here, disappointing given how ideal that setting can be for a B-thriller that might be in need of a lift, exemplified by Rachel MacAdams in Red Eye, Jodie Foster in Flight Plan, Liam Neeson in Non-Stop and, hopefully, Taron Egerton in the upcoming Carry On. Everything you need to know about Plane can more easily be summed up by Butler’s absurd character name – Brodie Torrance, something one would expect to find in a half-price airport potboiler. He’s a salt-of-the-earth Scottish pilot, whose character can best be described as pilot, tasked with flying a tiny number of passengers on a new year’s flight from Singapore to Tokyo (anyone who has been on a plane in the last two years will find the large number of empty seats to be the most far-fetched thing about the film).But there’s a lightning storm which forces Butler to make an emergency landing on a remote island in the Philippines. While he manages it with the grace of an unshaven Sully, he’s then tasked with keeping his passengers safe from a killer (Mike Colter) who was being transported onboard which would be bad enough until he finds out that the island is run by a violent group of rebels who have a history of kidnapping – and killing – foreigners.A more accurate title would then be Island, but Plane is perhaps best at least for instructing audience on the best location to watch the film, half-awake, tipsy on wine served from a litre bottle. It’s usually the kind of dross that would arrive straight to one’s rental service of choice (like Butler’s last film, Last Seen Alive) and it’s only when one digs a little deeper, that we see the budget is a pretty considerable $50m, impressive enough whenever the release in this climate but at this time of year, that makes it the equivalent of a Marvel movie (in comparison, M3gan cost just $12m). It therefore needed to launch in your local multiplex to turn a profit although, it’s often a head-scratcher trying to figure out just where that money went. The cast, outside of Butler, Colter and a few scenes of a sleep-walking Tony Goldwyn, are mostly bit-players, the action scenes are mainly just lots of shooting and the plane scenes are often strangely shaky, as if someone is dangling a model plane on a piece of string.It’s just about diverting enough for the most part but there’s something a little off about its pacing, French director Jean-François Richet (who peaked a while back with his propulsive Mesrine movies) struggling to corral his moving parts, suspense never really arriving as it should. Instead, we get bullets, a boring amount of them in fact, with a finale based around who can shoot the most before that plane comes back into play. There are small mercies throughout: Butler is thankfully not attempting an American or, shudder, Irish accent (even if to prove he’s Scottish he says haggis in the first 15 minutes), his character is also not a readymade action hero (there’s one easy-to-empathise with moment when he takes a good 30 seconds to regain his breath after a fight) and Colter has real movie star presence on show here in bursts (even if it still feels waiting to be utilised properly).It’s hard to hope for that much more in January and the silliness of Plane will probably do the job for those burned out by the stone-faced seriousness of awards season fodder but for a film all about unpretentious fun, I wish there had been a bit more of it.Plane is out now in US cinemas and in the UK on 27 January"
The Enforcer review – Antonio Banderas adds class to straight-to-video throwback,The star presumably had one eye on the paycheque in this by-the-numbers thriller about a debt collector punching and shooting his way to bloody revenge,2,"Antonio Banderas is a class act but there’s only so much class he can reasonably be expected to supply. Taking what was presumably an attractive paycheque, Banderas stars in a movie whose essential personality could only be appreciated if Blockbuster Video were to be brought back to life, just for one week, so this could be placed in the straight-to-video bin next to every till.Veteran screenwriter W Peter Ilff (who co-wrote Point Break) has dug this one out of his desk drawer and Australian adman-turned-film-maker Richard Hughes directs. Banderas plays ’Cuda (short for Barracuda), a careworn Miami debt collector and ex-con, working for Estelle (Kate Bosworth), scary club owner and mob boss. He is estranged from the teen daughter who despises him and, out of fatherly sadness and a denied protective instinct, he tries to befriend and protect vulnerable runaway Billie (Zolee Griggs), who is promptly kidnapped and trafficked into a horrendous cybersex dungeon. The only way ’Cuda can save her is with his other mentoring project: a young guy called Stray (Mojean Aria) who earns money bareknuckle fighting and helping ’Cuda collect debts. Together they uncover an awful secret connecting them to this grisly exploitative crime.This movie hangs together plausibly enough although there are plotholes, and perhaps it would have had more punch if it was ’Cuda’s actual daughter, as opposed to daughter-substitute, who had been taken. But The Enforcer does have a great example of that time-honoured gun denouement in which our hero, disarmed and resigned to being shot by the bad guy, flinches at the sound of the shot, realises he isn’t dead and then sees a third person who has shot the aggressor: this film has a nicely outrageous spin on that. Otherwise, it’s a film that should really exist on a VHS cassette. The Enforcer is released on 6 January in cinemas."
Till review – a powerful portrait of courage in the face of barbaric racism,"Director Chinonye Chukwu tells the story of Emmett Till, the black 14-year-old tortured and lynched in 1955 Mississippi for supposedly whistling at a white woman, and his mother Mamie Till’s fight for justice",4,"A sick feeling of dread propels Chinonye Chukwu’s powerful movie: dread at the racist violence about to happen, dread at the racist violence that is then threatened against those standing up against it. This film is about Emmett Till, the black 14-year-old tortured and lynched in 1955 Mississippi for supposedly whistling at a white woman, whose testimony at the subsequent murder trial was disputed. (The closing credits icily remind us that this woman is still alive.) It is also about the boy’s mother Mamie Till, and her courageous campaign for justice, which began with a laceratingly painful decision to have an open casket at her son’s funeral to show everyone the shocking truth.Danielle Deadwyler plays Mamie Till, a calm, determined professional woman and single parent; Whoopi Goldberg has a cameo as her mother, Alma. Jalyn Hall plays Emmett as a smart, extrovert kid with an irrepressible puppyish enthusiasm: cheeky, but no more cheeky than many other teenagers, and mostly just naive. He is sent from his home town of Chicago to stay with family in Mississippi for the summer, with a stern warning from his mother to be careful around white people.Some of the film’s purest nausea resides in the trial itself, with the swaggeringly open racism of the court officials and police. Quite clearly, the fact that any trial was possible at all was down to Mamie Till and the NAACP who took up her cause; it was virtually a private prosecution, the terrible burden for this being placed entirely on Mamie Till herself. Chukwu contrives a stunning coup for the scene in which she arrives at the courthouse, surrounded by NAACP officials and is about to make a quiet, dignified statement to reporters, whose attitude is not obviously different from the jeering crowd behind them; what happens next is best not revealed here, but it is a heartstopping lurch of ironised fear, a bathos of horror.Till is a fierce portrait of courage and a sombre study of the human cost involved in resisting this kind of barbarity. Till is released on 6 January in cinemas."
If These Walls Could Sing review – mystery tour of Abbey Road Studios,Mary McCartney’s documentary about the legendary home to the Beatles’ and many other stars’ recordings is an enjoyable diversion,4,"Putting her privileged access to good use, Mary McCartney has directed this enjoyable documentary about Abbey Road Studios in London – famously the site of the Beatles’ classic recordings (her dad is Paul of course), but much more besides. McCartney’s film takes us through the history of the building itself (in the St John’s Wood neighbourhood of London, perhaps only Lord’s cricket ground is more of an English icon).It was designed to house a symphony orchestra, and its first occupant in 1931 was Edward Elgar conducting the LSO. It looks very different from the way we think of recording studios,small spaces divided from the mixing suite by a pane of glass. In fact two of the studios are huge, where mighty producer George Martin presided over everything from suites accessed by flights of stairs, like going up to the manager’s office from the echoing factory shop floor.Paul McCartney is interviewed, as well as Elton John and Jimmy Page, who talk about their days as session musicians there. The Beatles did their best work at Abbey Road, as did Pink Floyd, Oasis and so many more. But there was also Jacqueline du Pré recording the Elgar cello concerto; McCartney’s film has great footage of her vivid, beaming face as she rehearses with Daniel Barenboim.The 1960s gave Abbey Road its golden age of pop and then, just as times were economically hard in the 70s, Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and John Williams gave it a new lease of life by making it their home for recording the rousing orchestral scores for their hit movies. Williams gives a fine account of how Abbey Road – though a shoebox compared to Hollywood soundstages – is large enough to give the music its reverberant “bloom” but small enough to preserve detail and articulation. And he and his colleagues were amused at how drinking alcohol in the canteen didn’t seem to hinder the workrate. I have only one quarrel with the film: I would have liked to see something about Abbey Road’s part in the history of comedy, with Martin producing Peter Sellers’ comedy LP work there. But it’s a diverting private tour. If These Walls Could Sing is released on 6 January on Disney+."
Alcarràs review – heartbreak and ruin in the Catalan heat,Carla Simón’s award-winning story of a peach farmer struggling to make ends meet asks many important questions about our relationship with the land and the human cost of progress,4,"Capitalism never looked more brutal than in this new Catalan-language movie with nonprofessionals from Carla Simón; it is about an extended family of peach farmers in the town of Alcarràs, people whose unhappiness and dysfunction are created by market forces. It was the winner of the Golden Bear at the Berlin film festival and is this year’s Spanish entry for the best international film Academy Award.Simón’s debut was the wonderfully tender childhood study Summer 1993 and Alcarràs is her very accomplished follow-up. I felt it didn’t quite have the same immediately accessible richness and sweetness, but this is a really shrewd, empathic and subtle movie which engulfs you in its dust and sweat and heat.Quimet, played by Jordi Pujol Dolcet, is a middleaged farmer who lives with his clan in a rambling rented house with its own swimming pool, surrounded by peach trees, whose delicious fruit he is getting ready to harvest: backbreakingly hard work which he does by hand with family members, together with some African immigrant labour. His wife Dolors (Anna Otín) helps, as does his son Roger (Albert Bosch) – though Dolors has onerous housework and childcare, as well as having to massage Quimet’s aching back, with little thanks from her grumpy and depressed husband. Their teen daughter Mariona (Xénia Roset) is busy rehearsing a dance number for the town’s summer talent show, and their youngest, Iris (Ainet Jounou), likes playing in an abandoned car in the farmland with her cousins Pau (Isaac Rovira) and Pere (Joel Rovira).To Iris’s awestruck astonishment, strange grownups arrive one day and take away her beloved car: this is an awful omen of the problems to come. The supermarkets are offering Quimet insultingly low prices for his produce, and like other farmers he is getting ready for a mass protest. But his landlord, Pinyol (Jacob Diarte) has in any case curtly informed him that all the peach trees are to be ripped out and replaced with solar panels, and if he wants, he can retrain as a solar panel engineer, which is far more lucrative. Quimet’s elderly father Rogelio (Josep Abad) failed to get their land-tenancy in writing: it was merely a gentleman’s agreement with Pinyol’s late father which the son has ignored.This agony tears their family apart: Quimet is enraged that his way of life has been cancelled, but his sister and brother-in-law want to take the solar panel deal and his son Roger is in any case hurt at his father’s contemptuous indifference to all his new ideas on irrigation. And so Quimet, exploited by the landlord class, is also cruel to his own staff, the labourers that he must mostly lay off.Movies about rural ways of life are often supposed to be all about the sacred, seasonal rhythm of reaping and sowing. But here there is no rhythm. There is just one continuous throb of anxiety: whether the crop will fail, whether it will be eaten by rabbits, whether it will be underpriced by the supermarket buyers. And now the whole system has been thrown out. There is a new harvest to be gathered: solar power.Simón’s film asks us: is Quimet right to be outraged or not? Is there something sacred about the planting, growing and selling of peaches? Aren’t solar panels, with their superiority to fossil fuels, just as important? Might Quimet be, in some inexpressibly painful sense, simply loyal to unhappiness, loyal to a business that has not brought him satisfaction? There is something agonising, almost self-harming in Quimet’s protest stunt: he dumps a mountain of his precious peaches outside the supermarket offices: a vast, squelchy pile symbolising his wretchedness and rage. It is a deeply intelligent, humane drama. Alcarràs is released on 6 January in cinemas, and on 24 February on Mubi."

I Wanna Dance With Somebody review – smooth Whitney Houston biopic,"Naomi Ackie is excellent in the title role and the film delivers all the singer’s big hits, but it swerves the difficult questions",3,"Whitney Houston has already been the subject of two startling and effectively competing documentaries: Nick Broomfield’s Whitney: Can I Be Me? from 2017 and Kevin Macdonald’s Whitney, which was released a year later. Each in its own way was hamstrung by legal issues and family pressure, although Broomfield’s was perhaps the more judicious and insightful. Now here is a music biopic on very traditional lines from screenwriter Anthony McCarten and director Kasi Lemmons: a smoothly watchable and well performed piece of work. It is almost a 144-minute narrative montage, and very avoidant on key issues – seemingly deferring to everyone who is still alive and suing.British actor Naomi Ackie is very strong in the role of Houston (though with Whitney’s original singing voice dubbed). Houston was, of course, the glorious pop star who achieved mainstream white-crossover success but was crushed by sellout accusations, overwork, drug addiction, family strife and her volatile relationship with her notorious husband, Bobby Brown, and was tragically denied feelings for her best friend and assistant Robyn Crawford. She was found dead in the bathtub of her LA hotel room in 2012 at just 48 with evidence of cocaine use. Tamara Tunie and Clarke Peters give powerhouse performances as Whitney’s gospel-singer mom Cissy and overbearing dad John; Nafessa Williams is very plausible as Whitney’s loyal but finally heartbreakingly slighted lost love Crawford, and Stanley Tucci scene-stealingly plays avuncular record boss Clive Davis.The movie skates over the still fraught subject of who was supplying Houston with drugs and who therefore effectively enabled her sad death, and it simply does not mention that Houston’s grownup daughter herself died just three years later in a grimly similar way. Documentaries have tiptoed around the allegations that family members had to source drugs on tour; this film conveniently invents a shifty-looking white guy who asks Houston for her autograph and then cash and drugs are surreptitiously exchanged under cover of Houston getting pen and paper from her bag. Nor does this film mention the theory from Macdonald’s documentary that Houston was sexually abused as a child by a cousin.It does however deliver the big scenes and big moments, especially her amazing performance of the national anthem at the 1991 Super Bowl. But a boilerplate music biopic like this usually runs in four stages: tough beginnings, success, crisis and redemptive comeback. Whitney’s life can’t give us the last of these and this film averts its gaze from the grim final reality of that hotel room in 2012, preferring to circle back in flashback to the triumph of Whitney’s performance at the 1994 American Music Awards, in which she sang her famous medley of I Loves You Porgy, And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going and I Have Nothing.The ultimate questions are not really answered: was Whitney a gay woman whose problems stemmed from being imprisoned in the closet? Was she a gospel/R&B genius whose agonies arose from being a pop princess for white audiences? Or was it simply that she had to use drugs to relieve the stress of a touring schedule she was forced into by her big-spending family retinue? It could be any of these, and the film touches gingerly on each possibility. But it’s a muscular, heartfelt performance from Ackie.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotion I Wanna Dance With Somebody is released on 23 December in the US and 26 December in the UK and Australia."
The Queen of Spades review – thrillingly addictive tale of gambling and sin,Thorold Dickinson’s 1949 Pushkin adaptation is a glorious melodrama about an ambitious Russian military officer and a countess who sold her soul to the devil in exchange for the secrets of a card game,5,"Ambition, sin and horror are the keynotes of Thorold Dickinson’s brilliant 1949 melodrama based on the story by Pushkin. The density of visual detail and incident on screen is superb and the swirling, delirious onrush of storytelling is addictive. This is surely one of the great gambling movies, and one that makes the theological connection explicit: Pascal recommended that you have nothing to lose by betting on God’s existence, but the worldly sinner gambles that the last judgement does not exist and that pleasure and gratification in this life are everything. Dickinson’s control of the screen is a joy, something to be compared to Max Ophüls: I wonder how he might have directed The Earrings of Madame De… or how he might have adapted Dostoevsky’s The Gambler or Tolstoy’s How Much Land Does a Man Need?Anton Walbrook gives a glorious, gamey performance as Suvorin, a Russian military officer in St Petersburg. A humble captain intensely aware of his lack of money, Suvorin is obsessed, like much of fashionable Russia of the time, with France’s low-born leader Bonaparte, who rose to the top with pure audacity and courage. Walbrook appears without the raffish moustache that he had for his famous performances in Powell/Pressburger movies such as The Red Shoes and The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp, and his face is somehow naked without it, exposed and desperate. But his Austrian accent makes a certain sort of sense: in Pushkin’s original story, his character was an ethnic German.Suvorin regularly attends a dissolute military club at the invitation of his friend, the kindly, well-born brother officer Prince Andrei (Ronald Howard), who sympathises with Suvorin as a lonely, sensitive, prickly soul. What fills Suvorin with greedy, envious fascination are the fortunes won and lost there every night at cards: an addictively simple game called faro, in which everyone is superstitiously obsessed with the bad luck involved in playing the queen of spades.Suvorin becomes electrified by the rumour (though a flashback implies it is considerably more than a rumour) that ancient, haughty Countess Ranevskaya, thrillingly played by Edith Evans, once sold her soul to the devil to learn the secret of winning at faro; this was to recover her husband’s money, which she had lost to a secret lover. Interestingly, the nobleman who is supposed to have brokered the encounter with the Prince of Darkness is a real-life figure: the Count of St Germain, a philosopher and adventurer who appeared as if he might be French, with the same dark glamour of Napoleon, although in fact it appears he was from central Europe.Cunning Suvorin plans to gain access to Countess Ranevskaya’s house by seducing the old lady’s gentle, impressionable companion, Lizaveta Ivanova (a sympathetic performance from Yvonne Mitchell), and they have a murmuringly passionate encounter in the opera foyer. She is also being courted by Andrei, whose decent and diffident good nature is no match for Suvorin’s brash desperation and fanaticism, which poor innocent Lizaveta mistakes for ardent passion. This is in fact the one way in which the lowborn Suvorin has the advantage over the aristocrat – and the film allows us to see his self-destructive madness in not appreciating an opportunity for happiness.When the crazed Suvorin finally comes face to face with the cantankerous old lady, it is a scene of pure fear: as Nietzsche might have said, Suvorin is staring into the abyss and the abyss stares back.

Corsage review – a cry of anger from the pedestal-prison of an empress,"Vicky Krieps puts in a star turn as lonely, patronised Elisabeth of Austria in Marie Kreutzer’s austere drama",4,"Royalty and the pedestal-prison of womanhood is the theme of this new film from Austrian director Marie Kreutzer, imagining the home life of the Hapsburg Empress Elisabeth of Austria in 1877, the year of her 40th birthday. Like Sofia Coppola’s Marie Antoinette and Pablo Larraín’s Princess Diana, the kaiserin lives in a luxurious delirium of loneliness: notionally cherished, actually patronised.The movie even shows the empress riding at the Northamptonshire estates of Diana’s ancestor, the fifth Earl Spencer – and enjoying there a capricious romantic flirtation with her riding instructor. It’s broadly historically accurate, though this doesn’t apply to the use of Help Me Make It Through the Night on the soundtrack or indeed Elisabeth’s encounter with later inventions such as cinema and heroin. But Kreutzer sees her political melancholy as part of the tension that led to the first world war.Elisabeth is brilliantly played by Vicky Krieps as mysterious and sensual, imperious and severe: a woman of passions and discontents who faces icy distaste from the court and the family of her unfaithful husband Franz Joseph (Florian Teichtmeister) – this is because of her sympathies for the Hungarian part of the Habsburg empire and her intimacy with the worldly Hungarian Count Andrássy (Tamás Lengyel). Snickering Viennese attendants and officials impugn her Austrian loyalties as they body-shame Elisabeth – every day she faces the literal and figurative struggle to fit into her corsage and get down to a terrifying 18 inches around the waist.Elisabeth wears violet gowns, violet parasols, smokes violet cigarettes and distributes violet-scented chocolates to the unfortunates in hospitals and asylums. She only really smiles at the sight of her dogs and is utterly devastated when the horse that threw her has to be shot. When travelling incognito in Vienna (to spy on her husband’s mistress) she wears a dark veil – and requires an attendant to pose as her in this veil for a formal event while she is indoors shooting up. Later, she suffers the indignity of being congratulated on her atypical poise on this occasion.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotionElisabeth’s whole life is veiled, and Kreutzer sees her style of dress and existence almost as a variation of court mourning. The movie has her living in a series of huge, chilly salons and gloomy dining rooms from which she takes refuge in bathrooms, subjecting herself to various self-harming weight-loss regimes. She is a lonely figure, galloping unattended across various European estates. She remembers the alcoholism of her Bavarian father, who would put away seven tankards of beer of an evening and she confesses that she thought all grownups slurred their speech after dark.In many ways this is a study in anger, and it is an austere and angular picture. Krieps gives an exhilaratingly fierce, uningratiating performance. Kreutzer’s last film, The Ground Beneath My Feet, from 2019, had just the same shrewd sense of how women are isolated and restricted by whatever status they have been able to cultivate. For Elisabeth, the personal is political. Corsage screened at the Cannes film festival and is released in UK cinema on 26 December."
Citizen Nobel review – chemistry prize winner becomes charismatic climate crusader,This affecting documentary follows Swiss biochemist Jacques Dubochet as he turns the sudden fame provided by his Nobel win into a force for change,4,"Here is an invigorating portrait of one of Europe’s most distinguished scientists, caught at the very point of morphing into a public intellectual and vehement campaigner. In 2017, Swiss biophysicist Jacques Dubochet won the Nobel prize in chemistry – jointly with Richard Henderson of the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge and Joachim Frank of Columbia in New York – for his work on cryo-electron microscopy, freezing biomolecules in mid-movement and so rendering them visible for the first time; this was a great leap forward for pharmacy and medicine.The snowy-haired Dubochet, who did his important work at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg before returning to Lausanne, is shown to be at first bemused and a little flustered by the hordes of excitable photographers who descend on his tranquil campus, clamouring for interviews and demanding a soundbite explanation of his work for the TV news. But Dubochet is no innocent: he was a committed anti-nuclear campaigner in Germany in the “Atomkraft? Nein Danke” era of the 80s, and the film shows it dawning on Dubochet that he can use his new platform to campaign on the new issue that he’s passionate about – the climate crisis.Dubochet thus becomes a participant in climate-strike demos, beaming at young people’s idealism, appearing alongside Greta Thunberg, and becoming enraged at his fellow Swiss for their complacent insularity and at journalists for their supposed neutrality, and failure to report the crisis. He also – just maybe – becomes a little bit intoxicated by his own celebrity, a possibility hinted at during a discussion over the family dinner table. This is a thoroughly worthwhile documentary, although there is one subject I’d like to hear Dubochet address: as an anti-nuke veteran, does he have any time for environmentalists who believe that nuclear power might not be as evil as all that? Citizen Nobel is released on 16 December on True Story."
Anonymous Club review – bruisingly candid portrait of singer Courtney Barnett,Creative crises and the exhaustion of touring take their toll on the feted Australian indie artist in Danny Cohen’s revealing documentary,3,"Intimate and insightful on the highs and lows of life in the music industry, this portrait of the Australian singer-songwriter Courtney Barnett feels particularly timely. Using footage captured on and off stage, and a bruisingly candid audio diary recorded at the request of director Danny Cohen, the film works both as a document for existing fans and a valuable contribution to an ongoing conversation about the mental health impacts of life on the road.Barnett works through creative crises, wrangles doubts and anguish, and the wrung-out exhaustion of giving everything to an audience of hungry strangers night after night. While the film is not particularly groundbreaking in its approach to the music documentary, it’s unusually candid and open in what it reveals about the cost of the creative process."
Mr Bachmann and His Class review – extraordinary documentary about a brilliant teacher,The German schoolteacher of the title goes above and beyond – as does the patient director filming him – in this long but exemplary picture,4,"A marathon documentary about a veteran schoolteacher and his multicultural class of 12- to 14-year-olds in Stadtallendorf, central Germany, this extraordinary film, which won last year’s Silver Bear jury prize at the Berlin film festival, follows the tradition of observational humanism popularised by such film-makers as Frederick Wiseman and Michael Apted. It’s an investment in time, certainly, but this profound and hopeful picture justifies every second of its three hours and 38 minute running time.Dieter Bachmann’s teaching methods are unconventional – he leans on storytelling and music in a classroom that has a full drum kit and is lined with guitars. But as an early scene in Maria Speth’s sensitive portrait shows, his approach is uniquely attuned to the needs of his students, many of whom are recent migrants who are not yet fluent in German. Herr Bachmann spins a surreal story of sentient furniture and musical instruments, and gradually the deflated kids perk up and engage. Ultimately, however, this is not just a celebration of one man, but of all teachers who go above and beyond for the children in their care. This article was amended on 12 December 2022. The Silver Bear prize is awarded at the Berlin international film festival (Berlinale), not Cannes as an earlier version said owing to an editing error."
"A Love Song review – a sparse, wistful gem",Dale Dickey and Wes Studi shine in Max Walker-Silverman’s beautifully low-key tale of two lonely people,4,"A lovely, low-key showcase for the talents of character actors Dale Dickey and Wes Studi, A Love Song is a wistful little gem of a film. Dickey plays Faye, a widow camped out by the side of a Colorado lake, eking out a stripped-back existence of birdwatching, boiling up coffee and catching crawfish. The vast potential of the wild and limitless landscape is mirrored in miniature in Faye’s life. She’s at a turning point. On a whim she sent a letter to her first love, Lito (Studi). And although she’s no longer sure she will recognise him, she waits for him.There’s a sparseness and stillness to Max Walker-Silverman’s storytelling that is filled by Dickey’s terrific, lived-in performance and the brief spark of connection between two lonely people."
The Quintessential Quintuplets review – sisters compete for love in charming anime,The premise of a high-school tutor forced to choose which of his students to marry could have been disastrous but this romantic fantasy film avoids ickiness,4,"You fear the worst when you discover that this is an anime about a high-school tutor forced to choose which of his five quintuplet students to marry; will it be something flagrantly oblivious to recent #MeToo advances? But Masato Jinbo’s film is actually a fairly charming, if stridently sentimental and moralistic romantic fantasy that, with its clever structure, even manages to pick at the mysteries of identity.The story is the culmination of the Quintessential Quintuplets TV series, an adaptation of the 2017-2020 manga of the same title. One mitigating factor is that Uesugi (voiced by Yoshitsugu Matsuoka) is approximately the same age as the five sapphire-eyed quins he is chaperoning as the end of the school year approaches. Everyone is looking ahead to their plans for the future, but there is the annual school festival to get out of the way first. The five siblings are equally moony over their tutor, and gathering them together, he admits he has feelings for them, too. But he promises to choose one by the time the three-day festivities are done.Given how Jinbo flits between time frames, and in and out of character’s thoughts, following the identical quins isn’t easy at first. But the film quickly becomes an elegantly hormonal Rashomon, tracking each one in turn over the three-day period, carefully individuating each to the point it begins to graze the old nature/nurture chestnut: how flighty Ichika (Kana Hanazawa), already a famous teen actor, can be so different from the stern but protective Nino (Ayana Taketatsu); ditto overcompensating people-pleaser Yotsuba (Ayane Sakura).Weaving in a thread about the girls’ biological and adoptive dads, the business of settling this love hexagon is conducted with the same vehement seriousness as the Shogun picking clans in a medieval samurai drama – only with copious blushing and Uesugi gasping like he’s been run through every time he kisses someone. It largely avoids ickiness, apart from the bosomy waterpark intro; in fact, its insistence on the essential fallibility of the teacher, that they are there to learn from their students as much as vice versa, shows sensitivity. Like Uesugi’s ability to distinguish between the girls, The Quintessential Quintuplets looks beyond the surface. The Quintessential Quintuplets Movie is released in cinemas on 7 December."
Ximei review – Ai Weiwei produces inspiring portrait of Chinese Aids activist,"Liu Ximei, who was diagnosed with HIV at 10, is shown as a dauntless campaigner whose home provides a warm haven for patients still neglected in China ",3,"Produced by Ai Weiwei, this is a rousing portrait of Liu Ximei, an astonishingly resilient Aids activist; it also sheds light on a controversial government campaign that accelerated the epidemic in 1990s China. During the first half of the decade, poor farmers were encouraged to donate their blood in exchange for money. Due to a lack of health and safety standards, a staggering number of donors as well as those who received transfusions contracted HIV. In Ximei’s province of Henan, more than 300,000 villagers live with the debilitating effects of the condition, all while facing societal discrimination and neglect.In following Ximei’s day-to-day routines, the film captures the gruelling reality of simply making your voice heard in an environment that is determined to strip HIV-positive people of their humanity. The lively thread that binds this stigmatised community together, Ximei makes endless trips to the central hospital where she demands better medical treatment on behalf of other HIV-positive people, many of whom are elderly and illiterate. In contrast to the indifference of government officials, the warm atmosphere of Ximei’s home, a haven for those living with HIV, attests to the importance of community and grassroots organisation. Ximei herself was abandoned by her birth parents; later, when she was diagnosed with HIV at the age of 10 after a blood transfusion, it was her foster family that nurtured her sense of compassion.Shot over seven years by director Andy Cohen under surveillance and interference from Chinese officials, this film, like Ximei’s tireless work, feels like a miracle. In juxtaposing her activism and the hardships of her condition with intimate moments such as her wedding, the documentary beautifully shows how the lives of Ximei and many others are not defined by their HIV status. Ximei is released on 1 December in cinemas."
"Goodbye, Don Glees! review – stunningly animated film is affecting YA adventure",Anime tells a familiar tale about boyhood friendship and childhood gangs but does so with genuinely intense feeling,3,"Here is a beautifully gentle and melancholy coming-of-age YA adventure from the Japanese animator Atsuko Ishizuka. The story will be instantly familiar: a tale of boyhood friendship coming to an end – or shifting into a new phase perhaps, less intense. There is nothing new to see here, and yet it’s a deeply felt film, romantic and earnest about childhood. Though I have to admit I found the subtitling hard to follow in places; the dubbed version might be a better choice, especially for younger audiences.The narrator is called Roma; he is remembering the summer when he was 15, living on a farm. The other kids in the village laugh at him, and call him “cow dung guy”. His best friend is serious, hardworking Toto (Yûki Kaji) who has been away at school in Tokyo. Now Toto is back for the holidays with a new boyband haircut and a slight air of disdain for his country bumpkin friend. The pair have been inseparable for years; they built a secret den in the woods and called themselves the Don Glees gang (the name is explained later).While Toto was away at school, Roma buddied up with another kid, nicknamed Drop (Ayumu Murase), small for his age, wild with a mischievous grin. The moment Drop mentions “the hospital” with glistening eyes, it’s pretty obvious where his storyline is headed.The Don Glees pride themselves on their amateur fireworks – which are highlight of the gorgeous animation, along with a spectacular starry night sky. But this summer, the gang’s display is accused of causing a forest fire. So they pack up their rucksacks and head to the mountains where they hope to find a drone that will prove their innocence. Not one scene here is likely to surprise, but what a lovely, unashamedly emotional and affectionate look at friendship. Goodbye, Don Glees! is released on 30 November in cinemas."
India Sweets and Spices review – peppy Indian American romcom,Family secrets emerge and new love blossoms in this engaging if unchallenging New Jersey-set drama,3,"College freshman Alia (Sophia Ali) returns home to her affluent New Jersey suburb and the tight-knit but judgmental Indian diaspora community. But the weekly party scene and the gossipy speculation about marriages and infidelities begin to pall after she stumbles on her parent’s secrets. Meanwhile, romance blossoms with the son of the new owners of the local grocery shop.India Sweets and Spices is peppy, energetic and unapologetically broad in its comic approach. But the burgeoning romance is markedly less interesting than the relationship between Alia and her mother (Manisha Koirala), a conservative housewife with a radical secret past.In cinemas now"
Summering review – gender-swapped Stand By Me in the quirky-dreamy YA style,Some clever ideas are wasted in this wobbly drama as a group of friends discover a dead body in nearby woodland,2,"A gender-switched riff on Stand By Me sounds like an intriguing idea – a dead body is discovered by four pre-teen girls – and interesting things do happen in this film at first, in that it declines to conform tonally to what you expect; and yet the quirky-dreamy YA style persists. However, there is something uncertain and soft-centre about what follows, and the plot unrealities make it very silly.Lola (Sanai Victoria), Mari (Eden Grace Redfield), Daisy (Madalen Mills) and Daisy (Lia Barnett) are four best friends in an American suburb, whiling away the long hot summer before they start middle school. Rambling aimlessly through some woodland outside town, they are stunned to discover the corpse of a man, and find themselves mostly reluctant to tell the police or their parents: they want to savour this bizarre, rare secret and also realise that once the alarm is raised, they will be fiercely questioned and feel like they are in trouble even though they aren’t.This paralysis brings its own complication: the longer they leave it after the discovery, the more trouble they will indeed be in. It’s a sound, shrewd psychological insight. But then they move the body and discover a receipt from a bar (that time-honoured pulp-thriller plot move) and go there on a cute detective-jaunt to find out who the corpse was. Daisy even borrows her mum’s gun and gets to fire it at a padlocked door – all without consequences. Did she ever return the gun to her mum? Who knows?The dead man may symbolise the looming concept of maleness in their lives, the absent or emotionally unavailable father (only their mums are shown on screen). Or maybe he symbolises the looming relevance – or irrelevance – of boys. Either way, the ending is a tiresome new-agey cop-out and a lot of viable ideas have gone to waste. A disappointment. Summering is released on 2 December in cinemas."
Hidden Letters review – Chinese art of secret writing as refuge of female solidarity,"The nushu system, still practised in China, reveals a long history of women’s frustrations and the solace this art provides",4,"Nushu is a traditional secret writing system used by women in Jiangyong county in China’s Hunan province: slender, diamond-shaped characters they used to vent their frustrations and record their inner lives. This haunting but slyly subversive documentary about three present-day nushu specialists uses the practice to examine women’s changing roles in a China modernising at breakneck speed – though the forces of resistance are evident in the numerous episodes of impressive mansplaining surrounding this female preserve.A prize-winning nushu expert working at a Jiangyoung museum, Hu Xin frets about how the essence of the art is being watered down in dance-based presentations demanded by tourists. She believes it deals at heart in “misery” – and so looks up to wizened calligrapher He Yanxin, who raised her four children solo, as her inspiration. Hu has left her violent husband, but despite her high status in nushu, deems her own family-less existence a failure. Meanwhile, soprano singer and fellow nushu fanatic Wu Simu is preparing for marriage, but an uneasy look comes into her eye when her fiance dismisses her passion as a “hobby”.The powers-that-be are alighting on nushu as a unique artform with wider commercial value in the push to promote Chinese culture – but always in sanitised form. We see nushu banners hanging in a sort of finishing school/Princess Camp for young girls. One spectacularly misjudged proposal is to use the writing to brand “high-end potatoes”. Even ordinary folk seem to struggle to define it in non-patriarchal terms. One visitor at a Macau tourist expo appreciates seeing the characters on men’s clothing: “It makes me feel women are taking care of men. And I like that message.”Matters come to a head for Wu when her big-smiling beau tells her to forget nushu and ready herself for pregnancy. The plaintive song that follows (“White cloth wrapped around my feet / A handsome boy visits my home”) is withering in its commentary. He’s never seen again, and she chooses to pursue her craft and later unveils twin poems – one old, one of her own – that show the evolutionary possibility for nushu: making the cramped rebellious impulses of long-dead women echo with female solidarity and independence today. This is a deft act of historical revival. Hidden Letters is released at Bertha DocHouse on 2 December."
India Sweets and Spices review – likable Indian American family comedy,"Geeta Malik’s semi-autobiographical send-up of a snooty New Jersey community has interesting, awkward things to say about class",3,"A young Indian American woman Alia (Sophia Ali) rolls her eyes at her mother’s generation in the affluent New Jersey community where she grew up. The aunties, she jokes, are a bunch of “sari-wearing zombies”, only interested in shopping and gossiping about who’s getting married and who’s getting fat. Alia’s assessment of her mum – and her own privilege – are the subject of this extremely likable mother-daughter comedy with a smart script from Geeta Malik, who has said in interviews her affectionate send-up is semi-autobiographical.Alia is back home for the summer holidays planning to chill. Her dad Ranjit (Adil Hussain) is a successful doctor; her mum Sheila (Manisha Koirala) is devoted to keeping up appearances. All the families in their world take it in turns to throw fancy parties, trying to outdo each other with the catering. On a whim, Alia invites the Duttas, a family who’ve just taken over the local south Asian shop, to a party at her parents’ house (mainly because she fancies their son Varun, played by Rish Shah). It’s a clumsy thing to do: her dad is appalled (“who next, the gardener?”). At the party, the other guests are frosty and condescending towards the “shopkeepers”.Malik’s script has interesting, awkward things to say about class: Alia is completely oblivious to her privilege, and unexpectedly it turns out that Mrs Dutta (Deepti Gupta), knew Alia’s mother from university in Delhi; they were political activists together. The impossibility of ever really knowing our parents is a familiar storyline, but it’s told here with real generosity and warmth. Malik slyly pokes fun, but never meanly. This is satire with the thermostat turned up to 22 degrees. India Sweets and Spices is released on 2 December in cinemas."
Out of This World review – art and misogyny collide in murderous obsession,"The psychotic male with a poetic side is an old saw, but director Marc Fouchard brings some original and freshly disturbing touches to it",3,"This artfully made, borderline-despicable French drama revolves around Leo (Kévin Mischel), a brooding, lonely taxi driver with cheekbones sharp as dressmaker’s shears, a secret talent for musical composition, romantic longings for pretty dancer Amélie (Aurélia Poirier) and the uncontrollable urge to kill women. Whether he actually does that or not isn’t clear at first, since scenes where he murders one woman turn out to be fantasies … or are they?In a way, this film seems to not care either way because it’s essentially much more interested in Leo and his mental anguish: anguish that is seeded by a former chanteuse mother (Dominique Frot) who beat him when he was little. The whole handsome-tragic-murderer shtick is one we’ve seen before in an assortment of films, from Peeping Tom and Taxi Driver to Kim Ki-duk’s Bad Guy – but at least writer-director Marc Fouchard brings a few offbeat touches that add some fresh texture. For a start, Amélie, Leo’s object of obsession, happens to be deaf which means she can’t hear the music Leo has written and plays in the car, which one customer complains about rudely. But deafness doesn’t stop Amélie from being an expressive, mesmeric dancer, and the bits where she performs are some of the best passages of the film.Elsewhere, Fouchard’s blurring of the lines between reality and fantasy and fluid editing are genuinely adept and very disturbing, enough to make one look forward to seeing what he does next. Music, as befits a film about a composer and a dancer, is skilfully incorporated into the plot and the bits of music that Leo is supposed to have written (actually composed by Pascal Boudet, AKA Cyesm), are indeed rather lovely, little cycles of repetitious patterns that earworm inside your head, much like the film itself. Out of This World is released on 5 December on digital platforms."
Lady Chatterley’s Lover review – sensuality as an almost religious revelation,"Emma Corrin and Jack O’Connell carry this idealistic, moving French version of DH Lawrence’s transgressive novel",4,"Here is a movie that could so easily collapse into self-satire, especially at the first sneery-knowing intonation of the word “milady”, a phrase probably now most associated with Parker from Thunderbirds. But the commitment and passion of its two lead performers, Emma Corrin and Jack O’Connell, carries this new version of DH Lawrence’s Lady Chatterley’s Lover, and the actor turned director Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre finds the keynote of idealism. The film is never shy of eroticism and full-on sex, if sometimes going for a slightly quaint soft-focus approach. But Clermont-Tonnerre is never in any doubt that this is a love story. The last adaptation of any note was from another French film-maker, Pascale Ferran’s flawed Lady Chatterley (based on an earlier version of the book). Perhaps it takes a French and not a British director to respond to Lawrence’s forbidden tale of forbidden love.It is the middle of the first world war and Constance Reid (Corrin) is the beautiful and impulsive young woman of upper-class birth and progressive views who, after a chequered emotional past, honestly believes herself to be in love with Sir Clifford Chatterley; they get married before he has to return to the front, hardly knowing each other at all. At the war’s end, he is a gloomier figure, using a wheelchair after a terrible war injury, and it is in a sombre mood that the new Lady Chatterley is to arrive with him at Wragby, his vast country estate, paid for by the sweated labour at his colliery.There, she is alienated from the friends he invites up from London for the weekend. Sir Clifford is a shallow, meretricious figure: after dabbling in writing fiction, he throws himself into making his colliery even more profitable by laying off some miners and exploiting the rest more ruthlessly. This impotent plutocrat is coldly obsessed with producing an heir, making it clear to the bewildered Constance that he will permit her to have a discreet affair if that produces the correct result. As it happens, Constance has become obsessed with the handsome gamekeeper, Mellors (vehemently played by O’Connell, who maintains his character’s dignity). He is the only person in her life capable of human sympathy.Hypocrisy as well as sex is what supercharges the story. Sir Clifford is quite content for Constance to stray as long as it is with someone of the right class. But the film shows how Constance is a hypocrite herself: she initially considers using Mellors to get pregnant without considering his feelings. But their relationship and their sensuality become an almost religious revelation to them both. Love and sex, two things taken so casually for granted in so many different kinds of story, here become totemic articles of faith. Lady Chatterley still has the power to move.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotion Lady Chatterley’s Lover is released on 25 November in UK cinemas and on 2 December on Netflix."
Casque d’Or review – Jacques Becker’s gripping tragic drama of Parisian lowlife,Simone Signoret stars in a dark tale of love in the belle époque underworld that is a unmissable classic with a pitilessly grim finale,5,"A 70th-anniversary rerelease for this film by a masterly French director who is known for his craftsmanship – but deserves also to be known for his artistry. Jacques Becker’s Casque d’Or is a gripping tragic drama of Parisian lowlife set at the turn of the century, based on news stories and apocryphal tales of the “apache” criminal gangs that roamed the Paris underworld in the belle époque, terrifying and titillating those wealthy boulevardiers who liked to slum it in seedy dives.Simone Signoret is glorious as Marie (nicknamed “Casque d’Or” for her golden helmet of hair); she is a woman of the night, based on the “gigolettes” tempting gentlemen into dark alleys, who would then be beaten and robbed by the woman’s male accomplices lurking behind her. Marie, though, never does anything so cruel here and has a heart, as well as a hairstyle, of gold. She is currently kept by Roland (William Sabatier), a sneery and insecure criminal, who takes offence in a bar when Marie likes the look of a quiet, personable carpenter called Georges (Serge Reggiani), who is going straight after some time inside and not looking for trouble. Marie and Georges fall deeply and tenderly in love, to the rage not only of spiteful beta-male Roland but his sinister gang-boss, Leca (Claude Dauphin), who uses his wine business as a respectable front and a means of bribing cops and is also enamoured of Marie. He has a plan to get this low-rank rival out of the way by having him convicted of murder.Like Renoir and Ophüls, Becker has a knack of creating densely and vividly achieved visual set-pieces and extravagant, involving drama. Scene follows scene seamlessly and the screen is flooded with detail and incident. Becker uses real locations which have the immediacy of the New Wave Paris movies; perhaps this is the reason for Truffaut admiring Becker so passionately. The tragedy is shot through with a kind of knowing black comedy: a doltish young waiter, who is an inconvenient witness to Leca’s criminal affairs, is killed in a mysterious street accident, after which Leca organises a solemn whip-round for the boy’s tearful grandma.There is also a lovely setpiece when Georges and Marie, loved up and wandering the rural streets in postcoital bliss, tiptoe into a church where a wedding ceremony is taking place, and Becker creates a droll tableau of the bourgeois guests in their finery and the uncomfortable looking bride and groom. Georges himself looks uneasy and sceptical: does he sense that a wedding and a happy ending is not in his future?Casque d’Or leads up a great coup de cinéma: the final, mysterious sequence in which Marie appears to want to rent a certain room for a stomach-turning reason. In earlier scenes, Signoret usually gets an ethereally lit soft-focus closeup: but not now, in this pitilessly grim finale. This is an unmissable classic.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotion Casque d’Or is released on 25 November in cinemas."
Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery review – Daniel Craig’s drawling detective is back,"Benoit Blanc returns, with a cast of A-listers from Edward Norton to Janelle Monáe, in Rian Johnson’s ingenious new whodunnit romp",4,"The first one was good … this one is better: an ingenious, headspinningly preposterous and enjoyable new whodunnit romp featuring Daniel Craig as the legendary detective from the deep south, Benoit Blanc. Writer-director Rian Johnson has established his own murder-mystery working model, positioned equidistantly between the Agatha Christie approach, in which the culprit is revealed at the very end, and the Columbo approach, in which it happens at the very beginning. Here, as in the first film, the guilty party’s identity gradually emerges in the second half – not so much a twist as an unfurling pirouette. But Johnson and his enigmatic, drawling sleuth keep us guessing.Edward Norton is an insufferable tech bro called Miles Bron who has become a multitrillionaire through his stake in Alpha, an online network fusing data, news and cryptocurrency. He invites a whole bunch of pals and fellow “disruptors” to his private island with its giant domed building called the Glass Onion for a murder-mystery themed party: these include politician Claire Debella (Kathryn Hahn), supermodel turned designer Birdie Jay (Kate Hudson), YouTuber and men’s rights activist Duke Cody (Dave Bautista), scientist Lionel Toussaint (Leslie Odom Jr) and – most uncomfortably of all – Cassandra Brand (Janelle Monáe), who had the original idea for Alpha but was ousted from the company by Miles and his lawyers with hardly a dollar.But also among the guests is Benoit Blanc himself. Bron says he didn’t invite Blanc, but lets him in anyway, amused by whatever prank his guests are apparently playing on him. His idea is that someone will fictionally “kill” their host and the guests have to figure out who and why. Things turn deadly serious and of course the ashen-faced guests turn to Benoit to save them.Glass Onion is never anything less than entertaining, with its succession of A-lister and A-plus-lister cameos popping up all over the place. And Johnson uncorks an absolute showstopper of a flashback a half-hour or so into the action, which then unspools back up to the present day, giving us all manner of cheeky POV-shift reveals. Craig’s outrageous leisure-themed outfits are a joy and Monáe gives a tremendously likable comic performance as the woman with more than one secret to reveal and more than one grievance to hold against Norton’s loathsome Musk-ish plutocrat.

The Witch: Part 2 review – Korean horror combines hi-tech and old-style ass-kicking,"Gory and absorbing sci-fi sequel is part Stranger Things, part Orphan Black and all action, with a ridiculously good-looking and super-cool cast",3,"This expansive but absorbing sequel to the 2018 sci-fi horror feature The Witch: Part 1 presents, as its extra subtitle The Other One, which might suggest a narrative centred on another young “witch”. The first film’s central figure Ja-yoon (Kim Da-mi, briefly returning here) began to exercise her telekinetic powers only two-thirds of the way into Part 1’s narrative. However, Part 2’s heroine Ark 1 (Shin Sia-ah) is, from the off, able to throw whole cars around and beat people up psychically, having been raised in a secret facility where her superpowers were genetically implanted from birth. But Ark 1 was never socialised like Ja-yoon, the latter having been adopted by kindly if elderly normie farmers at a young age, so a lot of the time is spent watching Ark 1 adapt to regular life after she is taken in by young farmer Kyung-hee (Park Eun-bin) and Kyung-hee’s brother Dae-gil (Sung Yoo-bin). (In relatable fashion, she loves the food samples in supermarkets.) The farmers are being menaced by an uncle (Jin Goo) who wants to forcibly seize their farm, but like almost all the men in this film, the gangsters profoundly underestimate the power of slight young women such as Ark 1, Kyung-hee or, indeed, Ja-yoon herself.If you grasped all that without having seen Part 1, you’ll notice that the plot is a bit like a Korean version of Stranger Things, with Ark 1 as The Witch’s version of Eleven, the lab-reared victim-prodigy with extraordinary psionic powers. Writer-director Park Hoon-jung has also grafted on a subplot reminiscent of Orphan Black that involves a bunch of telekinetic young people in rival gangs who are connected to the story. They’re all ridiculously good looking and super-cool, like the members of competing K-pop bands but with extremely murderous instincts. (Bear in mind: the film is extremely gory and has deservedly been given an 18 certificate.)In the film’s more comic moments it explicitly links the biologically altered transhumans to the developed world’s fetishisation of beauty. For example, when tough tracker girl Jo-hyeon (Seo Eun-soo) is flatteringly described as having “rebel eyes” by a rival (Lee Jong-suk), she, in turn, praises his lovely skin, which is indeed cosmetic-advert perfect. He brushes off the compliment, saying it’s only genetics, and indeed nearly everyone’s looks and powers are “only genetic” in this world. But satire is much less the point than good old-fashioned ass-kicking and special effects, all smoothly executed and doled out in bite-size scenes. The Witch: Part 2 is released on 28 November on digital platforms."
The Menu review – revenge is served hot in delicious haute cuisine satire,A bunch of ultra-wealthy foodies get more than they bargained for in this riotous black comedy starring Ralph Fiennes and Anya Taylor-Joy,4,"Succession director Mark Mylod has an acute eye for the absurdity of extreme privilege. So the preposterous world of haute cuisine is almost too easy a target: not so much about eating as worshipping at the altar of the chef’s ego. The chef in this case is Ralph Fiennes, sporting joylessly immaculate whites and an expression of patrician displeasure. The guests at his culinary temple, run with a cult-like devotion by the ferocious front of house manager Elsa (Hong Chau), are a tasteless bunch: a trio of braying investment bankers, a needy movie star, a miserable wealthy couple trying to buy some meaning into their lives. And then there’s Margot (Anya Taylor-Joy), the last-minute date of foodie fanboy Tyler (Nicholas Hoult). Margot is more interested in sneaking a cigarette than fawning over chef’s sous vide technique. She is the one errant ingredient in the evening’s menu.Subtle it’s not, but it’s maliciously entertaining. It turns out that revenge on the ultra-wealthy is a dish best seared over a naked flame."
"Bardo, False Chronicle of a Handful of Truths review – bloated, occasionally brilliant","Alejandro G Iñárritu’s indulgent, audacious film is abstract, ambitious and full of personal symbolism. It’s also often a chore…",2,"When so much current movie-making is risk-averse, sanitised, cinema by consensus, you have to admire a film that takes such an ambitious and unfettered approach to storytelling. You don’t, however, have to like it. I’ve watched Alejandro Iñárritu’s latest – the wildly uneven, Fellini-esque Bardo, False Chronicle of a Handful of Truths – twice. That’s a little shy of six hours of my life (Iñárritu cut about 20 minutes from the film after its premiere). It’s audacious, bold film-making, a highly personal work that is cluttered with symbolism and bloated with self-regard. It is, very occasionally, brilliant: a deft reveal in the final 20 minutes ties together the disparate, seemingly unrelated scenes that came before. But with its overuse of fish-eye lenses and the quacking, whimsical brass-heavy score, it’s extremely hard work.In cinemas now and on Netflix from 16 December"
Armageddon Time review – worlds collide in terrific coming-of-age drama,"James Gray’s engaging autobiographical tale set in 1980s New York boasts fine performances from Anne Hathaway, Jeremy Strong and Anthony Hopkins",4,"Queens, 1980. The way James Gray tells it in this bustling, tobacco-hued autobiographical drama, it’s an in-between world, on the brink of the cultural explosion of hip-hop and the political paradigm shift heralded by Reaganism. But it’s also rooted further in the past and in the Jewish family history of Gray’s alter ego in the picture, sixth-grader Paul Graff (impressive newcomer Banks Repeta).Paul is flirting with the notion of teen rebellion – he triggers a family argument with his unilateral decision to order Chinese food rather than to tackle his mother’s baked fish (“It’s called scrod,” says his mother, swilling the word around her mouth like something she would prefer to spit out). At school he bonds with Johnny (Jaylin Webb), a Black kid who delivers the kind of scorched-earth comebacks to teachers that make the other children gasp with delighted horror. Paul wants to be an artist; Johnny would like to work for Nasa. And for a while, both ambitions seem achievable.The family scenes, all jostling banter and suffocating love, are terrific. Anne Hathaway is a frazzled mother whose status on the school PTA is not quite the power-play Paul believes it to be; Anthony Hopkins dispatches twinkly wisdom as a much-loved grandpa; Jeremy Strong is the disciplinarian dad with a whiplash temper. Preteen drama is amplified by robust and fairly obvious musical choices, but more interesting is the sound design: the city is everywhere, grumbling and fractious, the sound of a short fuse burning out. A brief, felted moment of silence allows Hopkins’s potent final line to land like a punch."
Aftersun review – luminous father-daughter drama starring Paul Mescal ,"Charlotte Wells’s debut feature is a stylistically daring, emotionally piercing and beautifully understated tale of love and loss",5,"Earlier this month, the debut feature from Scottish-born, New York-based writer-director Charlotte Wells picked up a whopping 16 nominations for the British Independent Film awards, an impressive haul second only to Saint Maud’s record-breaking performance in 2020. It’s easy to see why Aftersun has generated such excitement since premiering at Cannes in May. A brilliantly assured and stylistically adventurous work, this beautifully understated yet emotionally riveting coming-of-age drama picks apart themes of love and loss in a manner so dextrous as to seem almost accidental. Don’t be fooled; Wells knows exactly what she’s doing, and her storytelling is as precise as it is piercing.We meet young, separated father Calum (Normal People’s Paul Mescal) and his 11-year-old daughter, Sophie (screen newcomer Frankie Corio), on holiday together in Turkey in the late 1990s. Sophie is smart for her age (she and Calum are sometimes mistaken for siblings) but she’s still also very much a child, torn between hanging out with the younger kids at the resort or with the more boisterous teenagers who lounge around the pool table. As for Calum, his outward calm seems to cover demons of denial; a trancey energy that threatens to break through the placid surface of his current life, dragging him back into a more chaotic – or euphoric – existence (Moonlight director and Aftersun co-producer Barry Jenkins describes Calum as “wading through wells of quiet anguish”).Scrappy DV-cam footage offers apparently concrete evidence of the interactions between Sophie and Calum, with both roles being performed with quite breathtaking naturalism. Yet Aftersun is constructed as a very personal recollection, filtered through a haze of memory and imagination by the now-adult Sophie (Celia Rowlson-Hall) looking back on things she didn’t really understand at the time. That tension between fact and fiction – between recorded and remembered events – draws us deep into the drama, causing us to examine every frame as if searching for clues to a hidden truth that remains tantalisingly elusive. It often seems as if the real story is playing out beyond the edges of the frame, dancing in the shadows beyond the confines of the screen. Plaudits to editor Blair McClendon, who juxtaposes scenes and images in almost hyperreal, dreamlike fashion, conjuring a magical space in which time seems to bend emotionally.Appropriately for a work that is clearly profoundly personal, Wells says the roots of Aftersun lay in flipping through holiday albums of herself as a child and being struck by how young her father looked. Later, she came across a photo in which she was sitting by a pool in Spain, with “a very beautiful woman right behind me… and it made me wonder who the real subject of the picture was”. That sense of mystery runs throughout this mesmerising feature, which, despite being set largely in the past, nonetheless feels peculiarly present.Some of the groundwork for Aftersun was laid in Wells’s 2015 short film Tuesday (she has called this “a sequel of sorts, in a different place and time”). There’s more than a hint of the tactility of Lynne Ramsay’s early works, with short films such as Gasman (1997) and features such as Ratcatcher (1999) clearly serving as inspirations. Just as Ramsay has an almost uncanny ability to capture the texture of memories on screen, so Wells showcases a Proustian talent for transporting the audience back into a world they didn’t actually experience, while making them feel like they did. There are also clear traces of the films of Margaret Tait in Wells’s craft, specifically Blue Black Permanent (1992), which seems to have served as a tonal reference (a volume of Tait’s writings is prominently displayed on screen).Gregory Oke’s cinematography captures the colour of memory, with bright exteriors and glowing surfaces carefully graded by Kath Raisch to evoke vivid snapshots of fleeting moments. Composer Oliver Coates weaves his way in and out of the film’s emotional labyrinth, while deftly chosen needle drops (including a mashed-up vocal version of the Queen-David Bowie hit Under Pressure) put us right there in the moment."
Cinema Speculation by Quentin Tarantino review – bracing and heartfelt collection,The movie-maker’s first book of criticism is fuelled by a breathless energy  that makes up for its scattershot approach,0,"Some years ago, purely for work purposes, I visited a “cult TV convention” at a hotel in Solihull, where the fans at the bar were all dressed as Klingons and Peter Tork from the Monkees hosted an unruly pub quiz. Parked at a table, the B-movie actor John Saxon signed souvenir headshots for £10 a time. Saxon was in attendance thanks to his roles in Falcon Crest, Dynasty and The Six Million Dollar Man, but the indignity of the occasion showed on every line of his face. “I once made a movie with Marlon Brando,” he explained with a sigh.Had the road forked, it could all have been different. Midway through Cinema Speculation, Quentin Tarantino mentions Saxon as one of his early choices to play Max Cherry, the careworn bail bondsman in the 1997 film Jackie Brown. While the part eventually went to Robert Forster, another B-movie mainstay, this casual aside hints at an alternative history, a parallel track. Indirectly, it reminds us that movies are serendipitous, defined as much by rewrites, casting coin-flips and crowd reaction as they are by any singular auteurist vision. Jeff Bridges almost starred in Taxi Driver. Steve McQueen was nearly the Sundance Kid. Every film – great or small – carries the ghosts of the films that it might have been.Which brings us to the rollicking, ramshackle Cinema Speculation, Tarantino’s debut collection of film criticism, arriving hard on the heels of his novelisation of his 2019 film Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood. It’s fascinated by the inexact science of movie production and promotion, the behind-the-scenes niggles that created the classics. Tarantino likes looking under the bonnet and pulling at the fabric, showing how a film was put together and explaining how it could have gone other ways. Or rather, he does until he doesn’t: until his focus shifts and his attention pivots and he promptly starts chasing a fresh train of thought. His book embodies its sliding-doors concept, almost to a fault.But for a combination of talent and chutzpah, the director might have spent his days on the convention circuit himself. He’s the video-store geek who struck gold, the fanboy turned emperor. Some film-makers prefer to conceal their influences (“I feel like the inventor of cinema,” said Werner Herzog). Tarantino, endearingly, wears his on the outside, like a one-man Pompidou Centre with all the piping exposed. True to form, Cinema Speculation conducts a personal joyride through his film education, veering from the recognised heavyweights of 1970s Hollywood (Deliverance, Rocky, Dirty Harry) to a menagerie of scrappy unsung outsiders.Tarantino pays lavish tribute to John Flynn’s 1977 thriller Rolling Thunder (the film, he feels, that gave him permission to be a director) and Kevin Thomas (one-time second-string critic at the Los Angeles Times). Jumping the points, he grants a standalone chapter to Floyd Ray Wilson, a flaky childhood mentor and wannabe screenwriter who planted the seed for 2012’s Django Unchained. “I don’t know how [Floyd] died, where he died or where he’s buried,” he says. “But I do know I should’ve thanked him.”As a critic, it transpires, Tarantino writes exactly as he speaks, in a torrent of information and opinions; fuelled by breathless enthusiasm and unexplained grudges, rhetorical questions and full-throttle digressions. He’s frequently at loggerheads with the films that he loves, all but browbeating the scriptwriter Walter Hill to rubber-stamp his issues with Sam Peckinpah’s 1972 movie The Getaway. Tarantino’s celebration of Taxi Driver, moreover, is very nearly a roast. Having convincingly established the film as essentially a “paraphrased remake” of John Ford’s western The Searchers, he can’t resist slamming what he regards as its compromised racial politics and accusing Martin Scorsese of hypocrisy for his pious stance on screen violence. Taxi Driver was at pains to paint its antihero Travis Bickle as a traumatised war veteran. Hilariously, Tarantino isn’t buying that either. He says: “No fucking way was Travis in Vietnam.”I’m tempted to file Cinema Speculation as a paraphrased remake itself – an extended extrapolation of its author’s film-making day job. As with his pictures, it’s garrulous, indulgent and in desperate need of an edit. But it’s also bracing and heartfelt, positively ringing with life. Tarantino is happiest going deep on the pictures; he largely leaves himself unexamined. Nonetheless, this whiplashing tour sheds light on his apprenticeship, revealing the rackety upbringing of the boy who would one day be king. Like Proust with his madeleine, he remembers being dragged by his mum and her dates to see blaxploitation pictures at the Tower theatre in Compton, California. Tarantino recalls the wonder, the danger, the sense of tasting forbidden fruit. It’s an experience, he says, he’s been trying to replicate ever since. He’s come close with his films. He comes close, too, with this book. Cinema Speculation by Quentin Tarantino is published by Weidenfeld & Nicolson (£25). To support the Guardian and Observer order your copy at guardianbookshop.com.

Paul Newman: The Extraordinary Life of an Ordinary Man review – a screen idol full of self-loathing,"A painfully revealing memoir, taken from transcripts of reminiscences Newman recorded in the 1980s, lays bare a candid, complicated star",0,"Movie stars, bemused by their own magnified faces, don’t usually have much interest in self-analysis. Paul Newman turns out to be the ruthlessly candid exception. In the late 1980s, between beery binges, Newman recorded endless hours of reminiscences, trying finally to understand the insecure, inadequate stranger who skulked behind his handsome facade. Probably alarmed by what he’d revealed, he later destroyed the tapes. But after his death in 2008, 14,000 pages of transcripts were discovered in his musty Connecticut basement and in a storage locker; these have now been cut and pasted into an autobiography, supplemented by contributions from colleagues and family members. The result is startling: Narcissus breaks the mirror, leaving only some cruelly jagged shards.In the early 1950s, Newman seemed the most unthreatening of Hollywood’s angry young men – less eruptive than Marlon Brando, less twitchy than Montgomery Clift, less surly than James Dean. Tempering the fury unleashed by the others, he played a redeemed hoodlum in Somebody Up There Likes Me and an introverted outlaw in The Left Handed Gun. Eventually, as a wise-cracking robber in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and a playful gambler in The Sting, he settled down to be wry and irresistibly charming. But his book hardly mentions roles like these; instead, he ridicules “this goddamn movie star with blue eyes cast as a half-Apache in Hombre”. Overcome by a sense of unworthiness that festers into self-contempt, he calls himself “that decorative little shit”, a merely ornamental creature with an empty centre.His mother takes most of the blame. Her crime was to adore him, as the fans he cold-shouldered later did. She dandled him like a doll and he compares himself to the lapdogs she stuffed with chocolates until they “became so cancerous and obese they could hardly move”. Stifled by her cosseting, he refused to reciprocate affection and developed a protective “carapace of indifference”. That explains why many of his later performances – for instance as a defecting cold war scientist who switches off his emotions in Hitchcock’s Torn Curtain, or a cynically amused private eye in The Drowning Pool – can seem blandly detached.Like the alcoholic husband he played in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Newman relied on liquor to ease him into a merciful numbness. He has a crackpot theory, probably concocted when he was sloshed, which maintains that the British never get as drunk as Americans do because they like warm beer and don’t put ice in whisky, which means that their bodies have no need to heat up the alcohol they consume to blood temperature before it can be absorbed. “My whole system,” he says, “was based on catching up with those ice cubes.” It’s a shrewd comment on his emotional refrigeration: those blue eyes do often seem glacial.In Newman’s telling, he chaotically improvised his way through an unscripted life. At college, he organised panty raids on sororities, in the navy he boozed. Obliged to find work, the best he could manage was a modelling job in “a cover shoot for a detective magazine”. He blundered into a first marriage without rehearsing the sex: “We waited,” he groans, “until the wedding night”, when they immediately conceived a child. With his second wife, Joanne Woodward, he took direction from what he calls “this thing I carried around in my trousers”. Attending classes for method actors, who were expected to draw on their emotional memories when on stage, Newman realised that he “didn’t know enough about my own feelings to start examining them”.Danger ejected him from this state of anaesthesia. Hence his obsession with racing cars, which began with a movie role as a grand prix driver in Winning but took him “outside that fictional experience into something real and quite primitive”. More culpably, he also urged his son, Scott – an addict and an unsuccessful actor, with whom his relationship was “a dance of death” – to take high-speed risks on the road. At one lacerating moment, Newman recalls that he considered shooting himself to rid Scott of “the affliction that was me”; in the event, it was the unhappy Scott who died prematurely.Given this psychological record, Newman refuses to take credit for his much-praised philanthropy. Although the salad dressing sold as Newman’s Own generated millions for charitable causes, he winces at the way he marketed his celebrity on the shelves of grocery stores and suspects that his altruism came “from having no civic impulses at all, just inventing them the way I invented everything”. Presumably that also applies to his political activities in support of candidates who opposed the Vietnam war; though he voted Democrat, Newman defines himself as “an emotional Republican” – hard faced and self-contained or, as a college crony says of him, “tough and cold”, even “devilish”.Two of Newman’s daughters, contributing a foreword and afterword, claim that after recording the tapes he became “more present” in his remaining years. That’s good to hear, but it’s easy to see why he decided back then not to publish the agonised testimony. Praising Newman’s performance as a fearful, drink-bleared lawyer in The Verdict, Robert Altman remarked that “he shows you his pink places”. This book turns him inside out all over again: bravely outfacing pain, it resembles a self-administered colonoscopy.Paul Newman: The Extraordinary Life of an Ordinary Man is published by Century (£25).

Sansón and Me review – sobering account of teenager sentenced to life for murder,"Director Rodrigo Reyes re-enacts his experiences with a young Mexican serving life without parole, weighing up the pressures and life choices",4,"With this startling and sombre documentary, Mexican film-maker Rodrigo Reyes has conducted an experiment in verbatim cinema, or what you might call witness cinema. In 2014, Reyes was at his day job as a California court interpreter translating for a defendant: Sansón Noe Andrade, a young Mexican immigrant who was to be convicted for first-degree murder having been the driver for a drive-by gang shooting, conducted by his 15-year-old brother-in-law. Andrade got life without parole, having denied guilt and denied gang membership; he insisted he was reluctantly giving his brother-in-law a lift out of politeness with no idea of his intention. Andrade had turned down a plea bargain, but then made a bad impression on the jury by claiming not to have heard any gunshots.Later, Reyes entered into a correspondence with Andrade, who was to tell him he refused any deal because he was scared of gang reprisals (although his brother-in-law took a deal) and still insists he was not a gang member, though had to join up once in prison for his own safety. So Reyes made it his mission to create a film based on Andrade’s unhappy life, using an actor, Gerardo Reyes, to play Andrade’s adult self and reconstruct their jail-visit conversations on the stage of a cinema in front of a blank screen. More audaciously still, Reyes got Andrade’s sister and brother-in-law to play his parents in reconstructions of his troubled childhood in the Mexican town of Tecomán, with his nephew Antonio, or Toñito, playing his pre-teen self.Soon it becomes clear that this real family is experiencing exactly the same pressures and miseries and young Toñito might well wind up going the same way. Inevitably, the director puts his own life in parallel with Andrade’s and suggests if things had gone another way, his life might have come out like this. Maybe: although the real parallel is between Andrade and Toñito. A very sobering inquiry. Sansón and Me is released on 18 November at Bertha DocHouse, London."
Dear Elizabeth review – fist-chewingly creepy comedy ,Arrested Development star Tony Hale plays a socially challenged man who attempts to exploit a college friendship with the film star Elizabeth Banks,2,"Hearts audibly sink when Sid Straw (Tony Hale) cranks up his chummy banter. His colleagues can barely bring themselves to make eye contact when he attempts to engage; his sister-in-law has all but banned him from family events. So when Sid claims to have been college friends with The Hunger Games star Elizabeth Banks, there’s a degree of cynicism, which is not helped by the fact that social media neophyte Sid inadvertently and very publicly starts bombarding her with cringey messages.The picture goes full bore on the skin-crawling creepiness of Sid’s slow-motion car crash into internet ignominy – it’s amusing, in a fist-chewingly uncomfortable way – but it then attempts to redeem the character in the final act, not wholly successfully.On digital platforms from 14 November"
Retrograde review – extraordinary insider’s view of US withdrawal from Afghanistan,Documentary maker Matthew Heineman watches a tragedy unfold as he follows the Green Berets supporting the Afghan army in the last months of the war against the Taliban,4,"Acclaimed documentary maker Matthew Heineman is known for his remarkable ability to stay close to subjects caught up in dangerous situations – be those fighting the drug trade in Latin America (Cartel Land), defying Isis occupation (City of Ghosts), or struggling to care for the sick during the Covid pandemic (The First Wave). This latest feature-length chronicle lays out an extraordinary insider’s view of the last months of the United States’ war against the Taliban in Afghanistan, as seen from the point of view of the last Green Berets supporting the Afghan army led by Gen Sami Sadat. While those filmed, especially the local soldiers, clearly disagree with America’s withdrawal from the region, the film itself tries to maintain a posture of journalistic neutrality. Still, just like the American soldiers who must keep repeating that it’s not up to them, you can sense that Heineman and his crew recognise they’re watching a tragedy unfold.Footage of the chaos at Kabul airport in August 2021 when crowds of desperate Afghans tried to secure places on the last American planes to leave bookend the film. Even if you were glued to the news when it was happening, you won’t have seen anything quite like the shots Heineman and his co-cinematographers capture here. Soldiers clumsily fire guns into the air, sort of, to scare off the hordes, and people claiming to have been translators, liaisons and support workers for the US military desperately wave paperwork trying to get through the line.The material in between, covering roughly eight months leading up to the final evacuation, is almost serene in comparison, although the tension is still palpable. The crew captures footage of the combined forces using drones and remote-controlled weapons to take out Taliban personnel. However, the sheer relentlessness of the Taliban’s determination becomes clear, as Sadat and colleagues see their control of the country erode piece by piece. It seems almost frivolous to note this, but the hyper high-definition cinematography is both beautiful in a savage way and adds immediacy to the viewing experience. Retrograde is released on 11 November in cinemas."
Dear Elizabeth review – famous name decorates warm-hearted loser comedy,Hapless Sid tries inviting famous one-time pal Elizabeth Banks to his college reunion. Nothing goes to plan – but the film retains real warmth,3,"The Hunger Games’ Elizabeth Banks is an unexpected choice as the muse of this Canadian comedy-drama, adapted from Michael Kun’s pre-social media-era novel about a sadsack software worker’s obsession with Heather Locklear – who, to be honest, was more front-and-centre than Banks in the zeitgeist of her day. Debut director Scott Abramovitch’s gentle film is less a look at digital-age fandom than an affable primer on accepting your own unremarkableness.Sid Straw (Tony Hale) is pootling along in his job as VP of marketing at a generic firm, waving/drowning on the midlife dating scene, and irritating his sister-in-law Janet (24’s Elisha Cuthbert) with his try-hard perkiness. So when he is called to organise a college reunion, he spies a golden opportunity to bolster his standing: by persuading his famous one-time pal Elizabeth Banks to attend. He begins leaving messages on her Facebook page, oversharing about his personal life and invariably signing off with “Eat wheaties!”; the special farewell the future Hollywood star would shout out to the volleyball team.But the hapless desk-jockey doesn’t realise the posts are public. As Sid’s professional life unravels, Hale forestalls what might have been a satirical pile-on with deft attentiveness to the nerves and eagerness to please behind the droopy moustache. He’s helped by Abramovitch’s fastidious characterisation, perhaps left over from its literary origins; there is lived-in detail everywhere, including a voicemail scene reminiscent of Swingers, in which Sid’s hands-free attempts to call “Kate, My Girlfriend” end up in “Ray’s Skate Land”.There’s a kind of bravery in having Sid remain an unfailingly nice guy, even when his world is collapsing and he calls on the service of a slovenly lawyer (Paul Walter Hauser). But maybe giving him some darker traits, a hint of stalker obsession, would have pushed Dear Elizabeth’s comedy into something more radically funny, instead of just being briskly amusing. The sitcom-ish direction drags it further in the direction of complacency, but Hale and the focused writing ensure it has a kind-hearted integrity. Dear Elizabeth is available on digital platforms on 14 November."
Bar Fight! review – breakup comedy turns into drinking-challenge face-off,An unhappy couple settle their rivalry over on a series of inane challenges in a film that mistakes dodgy acting for ambience,2,"This LA-set breakup comedy at least has a nifty hook: when a longstanding couple part ways, who gets drinking rights at their favourite bar? After five years together, flannel-shirted carpenter Allen (Luka Jones) and go-getting talent agent Nina (Melissa Fumero) are undergoing what Los Angelenos now call a “conscious uncoupling”. Having never fought when they were together, their separation proceeds on the same smooth lines – until they set foot in the Martinez Bar & Lounge on the same evening, both on the town as singletons for the first time. Staff allegiances are divided, so they come up with a decider: Allen and Nina have to undergo a best-of-three bar challenge, with the loser “eighty-sixed” for good.Debut director Jim Mahoney gets a tasty buzz on in the early stages, couching Bar Fight! as an upbeat Californian Christmas affair in the Shane Black tradition, with a rhythmical snap in his stride as the characters face off in front of the counter. He tries to make the Martinez a Cheers-style home-from-home, with boozy dramatis personae including soft-touch manager Dick (Vik Sahay), silver-tongued barman Mason (Daniel Dorr), and 1,000-yard-stare cook Elena (Dot Marie-Jones).These mini-dramas are interwoven with the central competition, yet Mahoney goes weirdly light on the main rivals’ backstories. There is some character development in a jarringly wistful last stretch, when Allen’s stuck-in-the-mud nature and Nina’s restlessness come to the fore. Deprived of this extra depth for most of the runtime, Bar Fight! coasts on not-especially-interesting challenges (trike-racing; blindfolded darts) and smug snark, exemplified by Nina’s wingwoman Chelsea (Rachel Bloom) egging her pal on to “root some dicks”. (She seems to have drunk Steven Stifler’s dregs.) Bar Fight! wants to be the best night out of your life, but – mistaking dodgy drunken acting for ambience – it feels pretty ersatz throughout, like one of those pseudo-Irish bars that has bought in all its decor. Bar Fight! Is available on digital platforms on 14 November."
The Box review – Mexican teen’s search for missing father attains tragic status,Hatzín Navarrete makes an impressive debut as a boy searching for the truth about his parent in a hostile world,4,"Hatzín is an adolescent kid from Mexico City, first met arriving in northern Mexico near the US border. Played by Hatzín Navarrete – at the time of casting a non-professional actor – he’s there to collect the remains of his father, a man he barely knew, who was seemingly killed in an industrial accident. Offered a box and an identification card with a barely discernible photo of the dead man, Hatzín sets off on the long journey back, but changes his mind and jumps off the bus when he sees a man who looks like the picture on the ID card. Hatzín is convinced with possibly irrational fervour – the film never makes it quite clear if he’s deluded or not – that this is actually his father, who is now only pretending to be someone named Mario. Mario keeps trying to brush the kid off, gently at first and then with more force when he just keeps coming back.Like Jacob in the Old Testament who insisted on wrestling with an angel until he blessed him, Hatzín wins the struggle eventually but pays a price for it. Mario (Hernán Mendoza) takes the boy in under his wing and puts him to work in his sleazy business recruiting people to work under brutal conditions in the local garment factories. There’s a very telling moment that says a lot about postcolonial capitalism when Mario rallies potential recruits by saying that their real enemy is the Chinese; they, he argues, will put their own children to work, taking advantage of their tiny hands, leaving Mexicans and Latin Americans like themselves in poverty unless they compete.Director Lorenzo Vigas, who collaborated on the script with Paula Markovitch and Laura Santullo, adeptly manoeuvres things so that the film slides effortlessly from mystery to criminal story to quasi-Greek tragedy, changing registers with subtle alterations of tone. The landscape – vast, desiccated, menacing – is practically a character in its own right, full of inscrutable secrets like Hatzín’s own deadpan face. The kid barely cracks a smile but he has an incredible presence, and genuine chemistry with the more experienced Mendoza; the latter projects a charisma that’s understandably compelling to the boy. Be warned though: this is the kind of film where there are drawn-out shots in which nothing happens other than a speck of vehicle or person in the distance trudging from one corner of the screen to the next, which might try the patience of more fidgety viewers. Released on 11 November on Mubi."
Watcher review – gaslighting and murder in Romania-set Hitchcockian thriller,A lonely resting actor in Bucharest becomes more and more disturbed by nearby events and is not reassured by her husband,4,"Not to be confused with the recent Netflix hit series, this is in fact a very solidly engineered Hitchcockian throwback. Company man Karl Glusman and resting actor Maika Monroe are the upwardly mobile young Americans relocating to a Bucharest bolthole boasting a prominent picture window; with hubby out schmoozing clients, his better half has time enough to dwell on a gruesome local murder spree, and the silhouetted figure peering down from an adjacent property. Suspicion shifts and moves closer and closer to home, but on one point Chloe Okuno’s film remains resolute: these characters would have avoided a lot of grief had they invested in net curtains.As recently as Wes Craven’s Red Eye in 2005, we could take this species of medium-budget runaround for granted. Yet Watcher offers not just relief that it exists, but actual, genuine, old-fashioned thrills. Striding confidently into studio terrain after contributing to last year’s V/H/S/94 horror anthology, Okuno works up a muted style and aces the setpieces: retooling passing extras as peripheral threats as the sound design goes right through you. She has punched up an underlying psychology in Zack Ford’s script: the wife’s mounting fears compounded by frustration at a Rational Spouse seeking to explain them away as girly misunderstanding. (Glusman’s heroically regrettable moustache offers its own grounds for divorce.)Okuno describes this gaslighting for what it is, and that permits us the rare privilege of a mainstream thriller heroine who actually errs on the side of caution throughout. As in 2014’s It Follows, Monroe is no pushover, and her reward for persistence, amid the nicely unpredictable finale, is a “told you so” moment for the ages. Unimprovably brisk at 91 minutes, Watcher is not messing around – and probably won’t hang around long in cinemas with starry awards fare in the offing. But a few more of these nifty diversions, and the multiplexes might once again be a viable night out. Watcher is released on 4 November in cinemas."
Lyra review – brilliant life and tragic death of Northern Ireland’s fearless young reporter ,"Lyra McKee, killed by the New IRA in 2019, is shown here as an inspirational LGBTQ journalist, bravely addressing the lingering damage of the Troubles",5,"Here is an admirable documentary about the brilliant life and tragic death of author and journalist Lyra McKee, shot dead in 2019 at the age of 29 by a stray bullet from the New IRA as she covered riots in Derry’s Creggan estate. Apart from being a grotesque homicide, perpetrated by swaggeringly unrepentant and clumsy extremists, the McKee killing represented a culture clash and a generational collision. An inspirational young LGBTQ writer, McKee came from a Republican community in Belfast, had written on depression among the post-Good Friday generation, challenged the UK government’s line on the 1971 Ballymurphy massacre, confronted homophobia in Catholicism and Islam, investigated the class inequality of the new peace dividend and – perhaps most importantly of all – started on what was set to be her first major work, a book entitled The Lost Boys, a study of the children who went missing during the Troubles, almost certainly in each case because they were witnesses to terrorist crime.McKee was a young, fearless writer, a world away from the macho gangsters of old-school terrorism who still plied their trade, in thrall to the paranoia and buried shame which McKee understood but they didn’t. Moreover, McKee was a product of new media; she went directly to the riots when she heard about them, a first-hand observer instantly tweeting and shooting video, very different to the mainstream Troubles coverage of yesteryear.The film gives a vivid and heartfelt portrait of this remarkable young woman, hearing from her family and her partner, with whom she first bonded over their love of Harry Potter. The film ends by pointing out that her funeral, which by general acclaim had become a virtual state occasion, was the first time the major politicians had met since the collapse of power sharing, and expresses the hope that her memory might be instrumental in restarting dialogue. Let’s hope so. This article was amended on 3 November 2022 to remove an inaccurate comment about BBC and ITN coverage of the Troubles. Lyra is released on 4 November in cinemas."
One Piece Film: Red review – eye-popping hijinks in spectacular anime franchise,"There are frequent stretches of nonsense in this anime about a pop star, but with music and a central story this good, they shouldn’t bother you too much",3,"It’s Saturday morning, the rain outside is relentless, the TV is on but the remote is nowhere to be seen – it’s likely down the back of the sofa. You’re stuck watching children’s cartoons, sucked in by the bright colours and high-stakes, save-the-world narratives. One Piece Film: Red is in this great tradition: a sugar rush of stunning animation, great music and a strong central story with frequent stretches of utter nonsense.The One Piece franchise centres on Monkey D Luffey and his crew of pirates; this one-off adventure introduces us to Uta, a beloved, stadium-packing singer from Luffey’s past who turns renegade and attempts to use her special powers to trap her fans in an alternate universe. The pirates work to take her down – and then a lot more happens as several dozen new characters and new subplots sputter and zigzag with little concern for cohesion. Narrative discipline is not the first concern here, but the core story about Uta and her motivations is emotionally resonant.A feast for the eyes and ears, every frame is decked with colour and detail. The final showdown is a sensory assault and is akin to watching a fireworks display – colours swirl and things go bang. There are musical numbers throughout, each accompanied by eye-popping, rainbow-dripped visuals that reel you back in when the plot loses you. The songs themselves are marvellous: performed by Japanese musician Ado, they stand their ground against current chart-toppers and justify the idea that Uta is the world’s most popular singer. When focused, this film truly sings, but it takes its time and tests your patience to land on the right notes. One Piece Film: Red is released on 4 November in cinemas."
Hunt review – Squid Game’s Lee Jung-jae directs 80s-set stunt-filled spy flick,"Lee Jung-jae’s directorial debut, set in 1980s South Korea, is busy to the point of exhaustion and ends up chasing its own tail",2,"This whirling, churning, exhaustingly busy – but lavishly produced – Korean action-thriller film is directed by and stars Lee Jung-jae, who played the down-on-his-luck protagonist Seong in Squid Game. Although he’s been a big name for years in South Korea, starting out as a heartthrob in the 1990s, his current fame in the west probably explains why the film was selected for Cannes and other festivals this year. That means it’s available to audiences who probably won’t know the historical context vital to understanding the plot. It’s worth some pre-viewing brushing up on South Korea in 1983, when the film was set – the regime was deeply repressive at the time and the country was riven by internal protests, while tensions with North Korea were (literally) explosive.If you keep all that in mind and think of this as a John Le Carré-style story, set in Asia and on speed, it makes a bit more sense. Lee plays Park Pyong-ho, the chief of the foreign unit of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA), who is locked in a power struggle with his counterpart Kim Jung-do (Jung Woo-sung) from the domestic unit of the KCIA – especially after president Chun Doo-hwan is almost assassinated while visiting the United States. It turns out there is a North Korean mole operating within the KCIA, and both Park and Kim are assigned to head competing teams to find out who it is.Some shocking twists go off like well-timed bombs in the back half of the film, somewhat compensating for what is, in all honesty, a bit of a slog. Lee himself is charismatic as ever, and as a director has a flair for the action, stunts and kinetic aspects of film-making. He seems less assured as a screenwriter, given what a muddle this turns out to be – crammed with incident and all just a bit too much. Hunt is released on 4 November in cinemas and on digital platforms."
Run Sweetheart Run review – goofy first date from hell B-movie,A woman is hunted through the streets of LA in a silly Amazon thriller that offers some low-stakes fun before over-extending itself,2,"In writer-director Shana Feste’s muddled midnight movie Run Sweetheart Run, life is a string of misogynistic slights for Cherie (Ella Balinska), a young single mother trying to make it at a male-dominated, female-assisted Los Angeles law firm. From unwanted groping on the bus to inappropriate behaviour at work, the men surrounding her are as blunt as they are unashamed of it, a familiar-to-many daily grind she’s accustomed to yet aggrieved with.When a scheduling mishap leaves her boss double-booked for the night, Cherie is asked to take his place meeting a client, scrambling together a last-minute babysitter and a last-minute outfit. Cherie is pleasantly surprised when she meets Ethan (Borgen and Game of Thrones alum Pilou Asbæk), who is handsome and friendly, a balm after yet another day of shitty men, but as their date goes from restaurant back to his extravagant home, things go from very nice to very, very nasty.Feste, a film-maker typically associated with earnest non-genre fare like the Gwyneth Paltrow music drama Country Strong and teen romance Endless Love, has described Run Sweetheart Run as “Get Out for women”, a refreshingly honest confession that her film is very much part of the, at times, exhausting increase in so-called social horrors. It’s a hugely difficult subgenre to get even half-right, something that’s been underestimated by many since Jordan Peele’s gamechanger, and Feste’s admirably ambitious attempt settles at about a quarter, her film working best in the early stages when the emphasis is more on social and less on horror.Even before the film slides into gory, full-tilt mayhem, the world is already a scary place for Cherie, who, like many women, is made cruelly, almost constantly, aware that male danger lurks around the corner. It’s an unsubtle escalation but effective nonetheless because, well, sexism so often is unsubtle and Balinska, a Charlie’s Angels survivor, is a warm and empathic actor who doesn’t struggle to get, and then keep, us firmly in her corner. When the micro-aggressions turn macro, Feste makes a decision to censor the violence inflicted on her heroine, a laudable course correct to the many, many films that excitedly indulge in women in pain, but one that involves a fourth wall removal that clangs. So too does Feste’s repeated use of on-screen text that tells her lead to “RUN!” whenever things get dangerous. These big swing B-movie flourishes feel that much more discordant given how so much of the film around it is made without the same sense of flash.As the running begins, the script, co-written by playwright Keith Josef Adkins and newcomer Kellee Terrell, starts to, ahem, run out of steam, devolving into extreme and extremely divisive silliness, in ways that can be charmingly goofy but most often not. The difficulty of balancing a genre film “that’s really about _____” is that when you’re trying to say something about a real tangible issue using an absurdist device, the gap between your ability to master the two, between familiar fact and fantastical fiction can end up making or breaking your point. In Get Out, Peele proved himself to be as adept at one as he was at the other, landing the far-out nuttiness of the reveal after such careful groundwork. I was also reminded of how ferocious and focused Mimi Cave’s similarly themed thriller Fresh was earlier this year, a film that also turned the horrors of dating and everyday sexism into actual horror, confidently gliding from coercive to cannibalistic behaviour. But here, the switch to gonzo hokeyness is far harder to stomach or even understand, edging the film away from a thriller-horror and further into comic book fantasy.By the time a vampy Shohreh Aghdashloo has turned up as an age-old mystical being using menstrual blood to save the souls of targeted women while telling us that the Adam and Eve story is in fact a lie, it’s hard to know what to think or how we even got here. It’s difficult to fault a film for being over-ambitious given the low-effort nature of so many genre films but the sheer, two-joints-in bizarreness of Run Sweetheart Run needed a surer hand to guide us through. As it is, that run to the finish line ends up feeling like a crawl.Run Sweetheart Run is available on Amazon Prime on 28 October"
"The Ghost of Richard Harris review – hallowing a hellraiser, defiant to the end",Documentary portrait of the great actor has been recut and benefits from a fuller account of the vices and passions that drove him,4,"Adrian Sibley’s documentary now gets a touring theatrical release in the UK and the Republic of Ireland: a revised and recut version differing from the original version shown at the Venice film festival, about which I had some reservations.Revisiting this film is in fact no great hardship for me: it was a pleasure to be reminded of Harris’s great performances in movies such as This Sporting Life and The Field, and his extraordinary (and extraordinarily successful) detour into chanson-style pop singing in the late 60s. But it is interesting that this new cut of the film gives a much fuller account of Harris’s ferocious consumption of cocaine, which I thought the film originally glossed over in favour of a more sentimentally traditional booze narrative when it came to discussing that picturesque concept of “hellraising” – although in both versions I liked Harris’s contemptuous refusal to be cowed or psychoanalysed: he indulged because he loved it.This documentary is better for this new emphasis and it gives a fuller context for the complex emotions now being expressed by his grownup sons, the boys for whom Richard had a passionate and poignant love, but from whom he was so often estranged by divorce and by his Hollywood career. Actor Stephen Rea gives a very interesting and alarming account of how dangerous and violent Harris’s acting could be (especially, perhaps, when he wanted to put a younger guy in his place) and director Jim Sheridan is frank and forthright about how difficult the great man could be.Watching this documentary for a second time reminded me of my feelings when I saw him in 1990 playing the lead in Pirandello’s Henry IV on the London West End stage, experiencing at first-hand that charisma, that lion-in-winter defiance.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotion The Ghost of Richard Harris is in UK cinemas now with an Australia date to be confirmed."
Louis Armstrong’s Black & Blues review – swinging doc is a stirring tribute,"Freewheeling across the trumpeter’s pathbreaking career, Sacha Jenkins’ immensely enjoyable study speeds through giddyingly rich source material",4,"Luxuriating in a wealth of archival material that encompasses radio and TV interviews, privately recorded conversations from reel-to-reel tapes (Armstrong could swear like a sailor), and good old-fashioned newspaper clippings (remember them?), this documentary about the great Louis Armstrong is a real keeper. Fans of the legendary jazz trumpeter are likely to complain that a mere 104 minutes is not enough to cover such a complex, innovative character whose career spanned decades and hope there will someday be a supercut that goes on for hours. But in a way this swinging, 4/4, 135 beats per minute biography-cum-essay crams a lot into its running time and makes relative brevity its virtue. Like one of Armstrong’s great solos, it feels packed with dynamics, sprinkled with astonishing high notes, and immensely pleasurable.As with so many docs these days, there are very few talking heads, and instead director Sacha Jenkins opts to layer the sound of unseen speakers over film clips and rostrum shots. One welcome exception is a wonderful sequence where the camera slowly tracks in on actor Ossie Davis as he recalls observing Armstrong when the musician thought no one was looking. The million watt smile was turned off, and he seemed like the saddest man in the world. There are revealing snippets of observation from maestros such as Wynton Marsalis, Miles Davis, Leonard Bernstein and more, as well as bits of Armstrong’s writings read by the rapper Nas. Among all the deeper insights there is plenty of juicy gossip and weird trivia, covering everything from Armstrong’s well-spent youth playing music in brothels, his generosity towards fans (he gave away coal to the poor at some gigs), his taste for marijuana and devoted use of laxatives. Who knew?Jenkins doesn’t exactly parse material into specifically labelled chunks, but there are distinct thematic groupings here: they cover, for example, Armstrong’s musicianship, his rise to fame, his ambivalent relationship with the white hegemony that ran the music and film businesses, the civil rights movement, and so on. Indeed, there’s a jazzier approach here at play than the usual straight-up chronological plodding of so many bio-docs. Consequently, the film skips from one year to another and back again, weaving and darting from idea to comment with an editorial fleetness that may be a little overpowering for some. But it’s not like there aren’t scads of secondary sources out there if you want to know more about Satchmo, or Pops, as he’s called. The film also represents an excellent primer for younger viewers who might only know Armstrong from, say, his cover of La Vie en Rose in Wall-E. Louis Armstrong’s Black & Blues is released on 28 October on Apple TV+."
Doctor Who Am I review – a genial dive into the Whoniverse with one of its creators,"Screenwriter Matthew Jacobs, who wrote Doctor Who: The Movie, plunges among fans of the sci-fi series to find out what makes Time Lord diehards tick",3,"When Matthew Jacobs’s name is first displayed on screen in this likable documentary, he is identified as a “mid-level screenwriter”; it’s more of a self-deprecating description than a diss given that he is one of the film’s co-directors (along with Vanessa Yuille) as well as the feature’s star subject. But his filmography is a mixed bag, and includes several things you may never have heard of (Bar America and the cartoon Justin and the Knights of Valour), little remembered reworkings of established works (a 1994 version of Lassie, Young Indiana Jones TV movies), the original story for one of Disney’s least popular works (The Emperor’s New Groove), the film adaptation for one stone-cold British cult classic (Paperhouse, 1988), and the script for 1996’s Doctor Who: The Movie.That last title is the prompt for this doc in which Jacobs, with some initial trepidation, ventures into the tight-knit world of Doctor Who conventions and events. Jacobs’s leeriness of Whovians – who mostly come across here as cuddly, sweet-natured people, no weirder than Star Trek Trekkies or My Little Pony Bronies – stems from the fact that many have professed to hate Doctor Who: The Movie because in it the Doctor (Paul McGann) reveals that he’s half-human and at one point snogs his companion Grace (Daphne Ashbrook). These deviations from Whovian lore seem to trouble the fans less when they meet the gentle-natured Jacobs, an Englishman living in the US who has his own bone-deep ties to the Who franchise. Eventually, it’s revealed that not only did his actor father play a role in one of the oldest episodes, from 1966, but that Matthew visited the set as a little boy.But that happy memory turns out to be one of the few peaks in what was otherwise a pretty miserable-sounding childhood, an upbringing marred by parental mental illness. That making this film provided Jacobs some kind of closure is nice, although as a movie it’s a little ramshackle and repetitive. A few of the interviewees try to define why Doctor Who means so much to them, and why departures from the canon mean so much, but the movie never quite wraps its arms around the whole phenomenon.It’s also very skewed towards the costume-wearing US end of Whovian fandom: the cultural disconnect between them and British fans in the birthplace of the story might have added some ballast. Still, at least in one amusing aside, an interviewee notes that if you go to a Doctor Who event in the UK the attendees, given Brits’ reluctance to dress up in public, will look as if they were just rounded up at a bus stop. Doctor Who Am I is in cinemas from 27 October."
Descendant review – powerful Netflix documentary on the legacy of slavery,A striking and sensitive film about how an illegal slave ship led to an Alabama community of inherited trauma but also defiance,4,"Descendent, Margaret Brown’s documentary about the search for America’s last known slave ship, begins with a distant figure kayaking through a sun-dappled swamp. Green leaves blanket the water’s surface and the rower’s strokes are slow and meditative. Nothing to see here, just a man – a Black man, we gather, as he glides closer – in nature, accompanied by the buzz of insects and the lone egret that is keeping watch. It’s a strikingly bucolic beginning for a work about so devastating a subject. We’re in for something different here, is the film’s opening gambit. It’s an unspoken promise that Descendent lives up to.Brown, a white native of Mobile, Alabama, returned to her hometown to record the search for the Clotilda, believed to be the last slave ship in American history. Produced by Barack and Michelle Obama’s Higher Ground production company along with Questlove (a descendant of enslaved people on the Clotilda), the film is a layered and slyly defiant portrayal of a community saddled with a shared history of unspeakable tragedy and violence. The treasure in this story is not a sunk vessel, as the interviews with its more literal-minded subjects might suggest, but a sense of justice and equilibrium that has been denied to a people that have been passing down their trauma from one generation to the next.In 1860, more than half a century after the slave trade was abolished, Alabama landowner Timothy Meaher is said to have made a bet that he could smuggle a slave ship without being caught so he orchestrated the capture of 110 Africans from what is now Benin. The enslaved people were made to wait out two weeks in the Alabama swampland before being divided into three groups and smuggled to their purchasers. Meanwhile, the Clotilda was burned and sunk to conceal the crime.Five years later, when slavery was abolished, the Meaher family cooked up another repugnant scheme: rather than take responsibility for their crime and provide for the newly freed people, they spun a profit from them, selling them parcels of land in an undesirable area three miles north of downtown Mobile, where zoning rules would accommodate industry to this day. This quarter, presently cut through by an unsightly highway and swarmed by factories and harmful pollutants, is now called Africatown. The enslaved people, and their children and grandchildren, were told that they’d be lynched if dared breathe a word of what had happened. Passing down an oral record has been their only way of preventing their own erasure.Brown follows the ship’s retrieval, but it’s the mostly white teams of scuba divers and historians and investigative reporters who get starry-eyed talking about scanning historical records for clues and dredging procedures. The Africatown community is more circumspect about the search party. “I don’t want the momentum of the story to be just about the ship,” says Joycelyn Davis, who has childhood memories of refuse from the paper plant raining down “like snow” on her school playground, and who recently survived a cancer diagnosis.With Zac Manuel and Justin Zweifach’s stunning cinematography and her own good sense not to place herself in the story, Brown delivers a powerful meditation on damage. Descendant serves as a stark reminder that “damage control” is a contradiction in terms.Midway through the film, the search team informs an assembly of Africatown residents that they have found the Clotilda. Those gathered offer dim applause and nod their heads. Their expressions are cautious, troubled.For all its cultural currency, closure can be a mixed bag. The eventual discovery of the ship’s remains inspires local news segments and the introduction of a new “holiday” – the governor of Alabama can’t personally make it to a convention of Africatown residents, but sends an emissary to proclaim that 8 February 2020 shall go down in history as “Honor the Descendants of the Clotilda Day”. Joycelyn Davis is seen sitting on a bench at the Smithsonian, facing an indoor fountain that is part of the permanent Slavery and Freedom exhibition. Davis doesn’t look too appeased. Reflect all we want, this is a story that will never sit well.Descendant is now available on Netflix"
Terrifier 2 review – vomit-inducing killer-clown flick displays the art of butchery,It all begins with a dream in this extreme and overlong horror film that is absurd fun rather that completely cruel,3,"Hold your nerve and your stomach: this gorefest is almost too good to pass out while watching it. Making headlines for apparently causing cinemagoers to faint and vomit, with an ambulance reportedly called to one screening, Terrifier 2 is not for everyone, but this tasteless wonder meets nauseating expectations. Blood, guts, molars and tendons fly across the screen with reckless abandon. No body part is safe from Art the Clown, a Pennywise on bath salts who treats the human body like a diamond-stuffed piñata, each blow and decapitation unearthing intestinal bounties and gushing reserves of liquid ruby.In between scenes of bodily mutilation, there is a plot – just about. High school student Sienna Shaw (Lauren LaVera) prepares a costume, designed by her late father, for a Halloween party. The night before, Sienna has a vivid dream in which she encounters a rampaging Art, fending him off with fire. For some reason, this also causes a fire in her bedroom. The following day, Sienna and those around her face the deranged clown in the flesh.The creative ways bodies are hacked to bits is the film’s only truly inventive aspect. These scenes are long and unobscured. Victims are left wailing in pain as they become Art’s plaything. Despite the bloodshed, the impressive practical effects help ensure the film is absurd fun instead of outright cruel, more in the vein of The Evil Dead than the torture-porn of Saw.The tacked-on commentary about the perils of unsupervised screen time and the gratuitous nature of true-crime entertainment, with namechecks for Jeffrey Dahmer and Ted Bundy, are hardly original, and the runtime is at least 40 minutes too long, but the commitment of the cast, and jaw-dropping scenes of flesh being turned inside out makes Terrifier 2 catnip to a certain audience.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotion Terrifier 2 is on digital platforms from 24 October."
Poltergeist review – out-of-the-box 80s scarer can still knock the furniture over,"Fright master Tobe Hooper’s 1982 movie has Steven Spielberg’s fingerprints all over it, but has a disturbing, satirical edge that’s all its own",5,"The 80s classic gets a Halloween re-release for its 40th anniversary: a supernatural chiller and anti-gentrification satire that came out the same year as ET – Mr Hyde to that film’s Dr Jekyll, perhaps – and one of the most Spielbergian films not actually directed by Steven Spielberg. It is also a movie with its own particular flavour of sadness, owing to the early deaths of two of its stars: Dominique Dunne, daughter of author Dominick Dunne and niece of Joan Didion, killed in the year of the film’s release by her violent ex-boyfriend, and Heather O’Rourke, who died in 1988 at 12 years oldafter suffering cardiac arrest and septic shock connected with a bowel condition.It was directed by horror maestro Tobe Hooper, who claimed to have had the basic story idea himself; nonetheless, the credited lead screenwriter and producer is Spielberg. Spielberg’s auteur fingerprints are all over Poltergeist, but some of the residual creepiness and brashness must be Hooper’s – particularly the scene in which one of the “ghostbusters” rather gratuitously claws his own face off. Yet there is a key moment where these two film-makers’ sensibilities fuse.The story takes place in a new suburban housing estate in California, a classic Spielbergian habitat of kids Edenically riding around on their bikes, making mischief with their remote-control toy racing cars. Steve Freeling, played by Craig T Nelson – later to be the voice of Mr Incredible – is an employee of the property company that has been putting up these homes on the site of a former 19th-century settlement. He has evidently been rewarded with living in one of these state-of-the-art houses. Go-getting salaryman Steve is bit of a Ronald Reagan fan (he’s seen reading the president’s biography in an early scene). His fresh-faced wife, Diane, played by the excellent JoBeth Williams, has maybe has more of a Carter-era hippyish background, and is seen smoking a joint while the couple loll around on the marital bed. (Post-coitally?) They have a smartmouthed teen daughter Dana (Dunne), a younger son Robbie (Oliver Robins) and a blonde-haired angelic infant daughter Carol Anne (O’Rourke).It is young Carol Anne who is to sense something strange in the TV which (in that distant broadcasting era) stops transmitting after the national anthem is played last thing at night and the screen goes to a fuzzy white noise. Reassuring patriotism is replaced by evil. Approaching the TV screen, putting her face right up close to the set, she senses something there, something which only she can see and which invades their happy home.There are some classic moments in Poltergeist. When Steve invites the three paranormal specialists to his home and shows them up the stairs to the closed door of his haunted bedroom, he listens dumbly to one of these experts frowningly explaining how some objects can move by millimetres over hours – then opens the door to reveal furniture flying wildly around the room. And it gives us one of the great creepy moments of 80s film history when Diane takes her eye off the kitchen for a second, then looks back to see all the chairs suddenly piled in a heap on the tabletop.The keynote of the film is O’Rourke’s eerie, ethereally pale face, illuminated by the unearthly light of the haunted TV. Her expression, with its faint and worrying smile, gives us a very Spielbergian close-encounters-type awe. But there’s something else as well: a disturbing hint that she has in some sense been seduced by the forces in the TV. There is a tiny, ambiguous touch of the devil child in her toothpaste smile: a coming together of Spielberg and Hooper. Poltergeist would be nothing without O’Rourke. The movie builds to two separate outrageous exorcism climaxes and a horrible disclosure about how Steve’s property company has been ruthlessly maximising profit from the land and cutting costs. Poltergeist’s special effects may look a little hokey now, but this film can still throw the furniture around.

My Policeman review – poignant tale of a love triangle inspired by EM Forster’s own,Michael Grandage’s adaptation of a novel inspired by Forster’s famous ménage à trois conjours a mood of British postwar repression and guilt,3,"Michael Grandage’s new film has been coolly received by some, but I found it an interestingly fragile and Rattiganesque melodrama of repression and regret. It is set on a gloomy English seafront and intercuts between the buttoned-up 1950s and the late 1990s. As an earnestly intended drama I can imagine it being performed on stage at a weekday matinee, the climactic speeches echoing wanly around the auditorium. But in its contrived way, it conjures a very English sort of shame.Screenwriter Ron Nyswaner has adapted the novel by Bethan Roberts, itself inspired by the famous ménage between novelist EM Forster, Forster’s policeman lover Bob Buckingham and Bob’s wife, May. Linus Roache and Gina McKee play ageing married couple Tom and Marion, respectively a former police offer and retired schoolteacher. To Tom’s dismay, Marion has taken a local resident into their home to be cared for by her as part of a volunteer outreach programme: cantankerous stroke survivor Patrick, played by Rupert Everett.But Patrick is no stranger: 40 years previously, he was the elegant museum curator and gay man (in an age when homosexuality was a criminal offence) who fell passionately in love with Tom and began a secret relationship with him, just as poor, shy, muddled Tom was courting Marion, hardly understanding anything about his own sexuality and certainly nothing about Marion’s, whose motives for taking him in now are fraught with guilt. Young Patrick is played in flashback by David Dawson, young Marion by Emma Corrin and young Tom by Harry Styles – who is not at all a bad actor, better than he was in Don’t Worry Darling, with a rather assured on-camera presence. His line-readings are a bit decelerated, perhaps as a result of coaching, but he has an interestingly melodious delivery. It reminds me a little of Mick Jagger’s movie acting.The film shows how much in this era depended on the importance of discretion, the grim hypocrisy dance of knowing and not knowing. And Patrick keeping a diary in which he swooningly refers to Tom as “my policeman” is indiscreet, as is his (absurdly) brazen decision to take Tom on a business trip with him to Venice.The modern-day parts of the film are not fully realised: older Tom and Marion are too accustomed to a life of reticence to voice their feelings: stroke-patient Patrick cannot speak anyway, and the dissolve-fade transitions to their shared tremulous past are a bit on the nose. But even in this constraint there is a certain kind of poignancy. I would like, perhaps, to see Grandage dramatise the famously tragicomic final domestic set-up of the ageing Kingsley Amis, cared for by his first wife, Hilary, and her husband, Lord Kilmarnock. My Policeman is released on 21 October in cinemas and on 4 November on Prime Video."
Hopper: An American Love Story review – frank tribute to the master painter,"A documentary that pays loving attention to the artist’s most significant works doesn’t skirt around his spitefulness, particularly towards his wife ",4,"The Exhibition on Screen has done sterling work over the years offering cinemagoers and (in its cut-down, small-screen format) TV viewers an excellent simulacrum to the experience of visiting a major art gallery. While its output has generally concentrated on the blockbuster names of the art world – a commercially potent mix of impressionism, post-impressionism and the high Renaissance – here is a welcome deviation from the norm: an impressive biography of American master Edward Hopper, whose quiet, precise and somehow otherworldly painting responds particularly well to Exhibition on Screen’s house style.This Hopper documentary is not anchored to a specific exhibition, but still presents the customary mix of loving close-ups of the paintings, knowledgeable talking heads, and voiceover readings of original letters and diary entries. (There’s some nicely effective soundtrack music too, eerie and mournful by turns.) Hopper’s difficult early years are described, and then elevation to glory after meeting his future wife, Josephine Nivison. Considerable attention is given to some of Hopper’s less well-known works – the bizarre Soir Bleu from 1914, the equally mysterious Two Comedians, from the other end of his career in 1966 – though most attention is lavished on key paintings of isolation and alienation: Automat, Chop Suey, Office at Night, Nighthawks.There has, however, been considerable revisionism of the Hopper story in recent years, and this film is not afraid to tackle it: partly concerning Hopper’s refusal to engage with the teeming multicultural streets of his home base, New York City, which was undergoing enormous social change around him, but more substantially with the oppressiveness of his treatment of Nivison, who encouraged and supported his work in the early days but found her own already-established career as an artist stymied and thwarted by his disapproval. Others have been more outspoken about the toxic nature of Hopper’s attitude, but there’s plenty of material included here that reinforces Hopper’s spitefulness even as he was dependent on her; the film’s title, while not entirely ironic, certainly points up their difficult relationship. Inevitably focus remains on him, but Nivison would make a rich subject for another film. Hopper: An American Love Story is released on 18 October in cinemas in the UK, and on 20 October in Australia."
The African Desperate review – archly knowing art-world satire ,"Art student Palace Bryant coolly contemplates the people crowding up to her, wanting to hang out or have sex – but there’s not much else here",2,"Despite a (potentially) interesting central character and a genuinely confrontational and uncomfortable opening scene, this feature from artist and film-maker Martine Syms spins its wheels dramatically, with indulgent, undirected performances and ideas. It is archly knowing about the art world, yet never quite earns its putative status as satire: a movie about someone graduating from art school that itself feels like a graduation project.The contemporary artist and writer Diamond Stingily (who has collaborated with Syms on other work) plays Palace Bryant, a young woman of colour about to undergo a viva voce exam from an uptight panel of advisors as part of her MFA degree. Some of them are supportive, some uneasy and one is openly sceptical about Palace’s claims to be creating work that engages with her African heritage. “Where’d you grow up?” she asks pointedly, a question to which Palace responds by calling her a racist. Yet later, at the graduation party, there will be hilariously derisive talk among Palace’s friends about other people’s claims to authenticity: “She’s not from Belarus – she’s from Las Vegas!”Palace is clearly as well-read as any of the faculty or fellow students on her subject and we later find out that she appears to be exhibiting at the Venice Biennale, and yet she is also coolly laidback with everyone she meets, all the people crowding up to her, wanting to talk to her, hang out with her, have sex with her, or just be with her at that evening’s party, which Palace is not keen to attend. Palace shows a politely wry bemusement in the face of everyone else’s excitable behaviour, but exactly what she wants and feels is mysterious. Stingily is relaxed and amiable, but in acting terms there may be nothing else there and the film doesn’t develop in any interesting direction. The African Desperate is available on 21 October on Mubi."
Ancient Soul review – Javanese mining film is beguiling and beautiful study,"A mix of fiction and ethno-doc, this portrait of life on Indonesia doesn’t quite reach the soulfulness of its models Apichatpong Weerasethakul or Lav Diaz",3,"Featuring non-professional actors from the Indonesian island of Java, this beguiling – and occasionally muddled – debut from the Spanish director Álvaro Gurrea treads the line between fiction and ethnographic documentary. Suddenly abandoned by his wife Olive, Yono (Yono Aris Munandar), a sulphur miner at the Kawah Ijen volcano, struggles to win back his beloved. His efforts range from the spiritual to the capitalist: the forlorn husband is willing to dabble in shamanic spells as well as cryptocurrency.Moments of beauty quietly emanate from the film’s penchant for static compositions. Engulfed in billowy clouds of hazardous sulphur fumes, Kawah Ijen is at once majestic and terrifying. As the camera often keeps its distance from the characters, the islanders are at times rendered simply as impersonal pieces of a tableau vivant. These vignettes of life in Java, though pleasing to look at, are sometimes emotionally alienating: Gurrea’s film is prone to aestheticising its subjects instead of meaningfully inhabiting them.The final third, however, is wonderfully lifted by more spirited scenes where Yono discusses his dilemma with friends and other miners. Nevertheless, this is also where the film’s difficulty in wrapping itself up becomes apparent. Perhaps such problems stem from a shaky understanding of the island, considering that the narrative restlessly jumps from knotty family dynamics to a simplistic dichotomy between spiritualism and exploitation. When Yono finally grabs the camera and turns the lens on himself, this sense of the subject’s autonomy comes too late. This film aims to feel reminiscent of work by Apichatpong Weerasethakul or Lav Diaz, but – despite the title – it’s lacking a distinct soul. Ancient Soul is available on ​​14 October on True Story"
"Madly, Deeply: The Alan Rickman Diaries review – great actor, keen shopper, sharp wit",The star’s thoughts reveal a man unwilling to suffer fools or mince his words – most of the time,0,"Alan Rickman’s voice was a purr, but it masked sharp claws. This was evident in the memorable baddies he played and now you can hear it in the feline prose of these selected diaries. “John Major said, ‘You have given us so much enjoyment.’ ‘I wish I could say the same of you,’ was the unstoppable reply. He had the grace to laugh.” You suspect not everyone did. Rickman didn’t suffer fools and his intelligence keeps chafing against his fellow professionals – their self-absorption, their vanity, their unresponsiveness. He snipes and then regrets it. After a barney with his latest director he writes: “How can I curb this ability to distance and intimidate?”It was an ability that casting directors noted and audiences loved. His smarmy cleric Obadiah Slope in the BBC Barchester Chronicles and his vulpine seducer Valmont in the RSC Les Liaisons Dangereuses were early delights, though he was already in his 30s, a late starter. He wrote to Rada when he was 26 after initially pursuing a career in design. He hit pay dirt in 1988 as Hans Gruber in the immortal Die Hard, holding a skyscraper to ransom while running a malevolent eye over his to-do list in a Filofax. I had never seen a suaver, funnier screen villain and I still haven’t. (Orson Welles’s Harry Lime is the only one who comes near.) These diaries begin five years later when he’s famous and famously picky. He turns down another script with this: “Would not require acting – just getting on with it while the camera has a look.” If a script wasn’t up to snuff he would change it, as he admitted doing for his Sheriff of Nottingham in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. It won him a Bafta.It also made him rich and an unexpectedly keen shopper. He loves buying clothes and popping into Conran for what he calls “gift items”. The boy who grew up on a council estate in Acton had a taste for the high life, and he and his long-term partner Rima Horton are regularly on the move between London, an apartment in New York and a house in Tuscany. They holiday in Antigua with Ken and Barbara Follett. Affluence has its downsides, though. When the director Stephen Frears excuses himself from paying in a restaurant (“predictably”) Rickman writes: “The general assumption that I will pay the bill is beginning to pall.” As the years go by the company gets ever grander: “Trudie and Sting’s Christmas party. Byzantium meets Fairyland.” “Richard Rogers’s 70th birthday party at the River Café.” “Car to Chequers… Tony hanging around at the door to talk to me.” One wonders if anyone dared call him a Labour luvvie to his face. Horton in fact served as a Labour councillor and Rickman put his politics front and centre when in 2005 he collaborated with the Guardian’s editor-in-chief, Kath Viner, on My Name Is Rachel Corrie, a play about the American activist killed by an Israeli bulldozer in the Gaza Strip.He is harrowed by bad manners and rudeness, deploring the want of “curiosity” – he meant an interest in others. He has sharp words on the matter even for his dearest friends, Emma Thompson, Juliet Stevenson, Ruby Wax. He claims never to have met a curious politician, “one who asks questions rather than makes little speeches”. (He offers the exception of Neil Kinnock.) A certain sighing impatience dogs him and he doesn’t mince his words, at least in private: “15 May, 2004. Jumpers. Stoppard bores me rigid again… Simon [Russell Beale] needs a smack rather than a director”. He has no illusions about his own repeat role as Severus Snape in the Harry Potter franchise, but it keeps the money rolling in and introduces him to a new generation of fans. He’s not a full-time moaner and will often write something to make you smile: “29 October 2005. Four great words – I MET TOM WAITS”. His design background didn’t go to waste either. The book’s endpapers reproduce his sweet illustrations and affable handwriting.Great actor that he was, he never starred in a great film. Did he know it? He ought surely to have been Valmont on screen – they chose John Malkovich, alas – and he turned down Roger Michell’s fine adaptation of Persuasion. On stage, I saw him twice in Private Lives opposite Lindsay Duncan and rejoiced both times. I spoke to him once at a party sometime in the 1990s, a burst of gush about how much I admired him and he took the praise with the slow-blinking cool of one who was used to it. He died of pancreatic cancer in January 2016, the same week as David Bowie, also aged 69. From his obituaries I got the feeling he was wonderful company. These diaries confirm it. Anthony Quinn’s latest novel, Molly & the Captain, is published by Little, Brown later this monthMadly, Deeply: The Alan Rickman Diaries, edited by Alan Taylor, is published by Canongate (£25).

All That Breathes review – Delhi’s birdmen on a mission to save the black kite,Two Indian brothers dedicate themselves to rescuing birds that are being poisoned by pollution in this complex and quietly beautiful film,4,"Shaunak Sen’s documentary is a complex, thoughtful, quietly beautiful film about the ecosystem and human community. Two brothers in Delhi, Mohammad and Nadeem (and their humble, faintly put-upon employee Salik) have spent the past two decades on a mission to help the black kite, a commonplace bird that wheels in the skies above the city, but is becoming slowly poisoned with pollution, just as the city’s society is becoming poisoned by sectarianism and hatred. They rescue injured and sick birds and nurse them back to health.The kites themselves are, arguably, not especially delicate or beautiful creatures: they are fierce predators who have become used to scavenging in the city, encouraged by a tradition of “meat tossing”, and the city’s age-old conviction or superstition that it is good to feed these kites because they eat the sins of those that feed them. Like ravens in the Tower of London, the black kites are thought of as a vital part of the city, a kind of secular holiness. The brothers’ ramshackle animal welfare clinic is dependent on local charity, and they are increasingly stressed and depressed at the lack of support, although a supportive article in the New York Times in 2020 (which presumably inspired this film) does bring in more money.But one brother is thinking of abandoning this vocation and going to study in the US, before it is too late for him to do anything other than this – so a sadness underlies the film. There is something quixotic in their support for the kites who would otherwise be unsentimentally ignored by the vast majority of people; Mohammad and Nadeem experience something mystical and mysterious in their devotion to the birds, a kind of ritual dedication to their community and to the ideal of interconnectedness. All That Breathes is released on 14 October in cinemas."
Two Witches review – jump scares abound in brutal and bloody dark magic tale,"This so-so two-part horror has more than two witches in fact, but lacks a fresh focus on the well-worn evil sorceress trope",2,"Maybe I missed something, but there seem to be several witches in this so-so horror feature. All of them are the not-nice sort of witch: the kind who invade dreams, steal boyfriends, eat children and, in the film’s most delicious scene, wreak cruel and bloody vengeance on guests who spend too long hogging the toilet at parties.Perhaps the title refers to the fact that the film is divided into two slightly overlapping but otherwise standalone parts, each one dominated by a different witch. The first, weaker, story revolves around Sarah (Belle Adams), who’s expecting a baby with her partner Simon (Ian Michaels). A middle-aged woman in a restaurant (Marina Parodi) unaccountably decides to bewitch poor Sarah, giving her all kinds of nightmares that mostly consist of jump scares piled on jump scares; it all starts to feel like one long, not-at-all-jump-inducing scare, and a noisy ghoulish makeup showreel with a loud soundtrack.A couple of supporting characters from the first part (played by Dina Silva and Tim Fox) crop up in the second, a much more confidently handled chapter which revolves around young witch Masha (Rebekah Kennedy, wonderfully creepy). Roommate Rachel (Kristina Klebe) tries to be understanding of “weird” and “sort of lost” Masha, but when the latter goes all Single White Female on Rachel the relationship goes south, with inevitably brutal consequences. Although Kennedy’s crazed smile buoys the back half of the film considerably, it’s all pretty episodic and blurry. Two Witches is available on 17 October on Arrow."
He’s Watching review – lockdown horror is home alone with the children,Jacob Estes directs his offspring in this experimental lockdown tale about a brother and sister trying to exorcise a prowler from their home,3,"Marketing this film as a Blumhouse-style found-footage horror does this genuinely interesting and experimental lockdown effort a bit of a disservice. Conceived during Covid times by Jacob Estes (responsible for the excellent 2004 teen drama Mean Creek) and his children Iris and Lucas, the horror elements are more sweetly vindictive than scary. The film is best described as a kind of pseudo-stalker-flick-cum-Freudian-video-diary-cum-dressing-up-box-raid, with Blair Witch and Lynchian overtones, and a meta fascination in the film-making eye, couched in the shut-in mania of 2020. Just run with it.Iris (Iris Serena Estes) and Lucas (Lucas Steel Estes) find themselves home alone during a mysterious pandemic that affects adults; they are only in technological contact with their hospitalised parents. Being the children of a film-maker and a musician, a pandemic of creativity also runs amok in this household. When teenager Iris isn’t looking after her needy brother, she is painting and vlogging, while he precociously knocks out Clair de Lune on the keyboard. But when ritualistic arrangements of objects begin appearing in the hallway, then clips from a prowler’s point of view show up in her camera roll, she accuses Lucas of taking the DIY projects too far.Modern vlog, Paranormal Activity nocturnal, high-saturated nostalgia, frosted-negative transitions: Estes taps every register in the film’s own artistic spree. But there’s a dark side to it too. Early on Iris finds a note from her father pretending he keeps watch over them as the “Closet Creeper”, implying that the anonymous presence in the videos could be the parental gaze. Or, like a YA version of Peeping Tom or Lost Highway, the forward-grasping compulsion of the film-making urge itself. Maybe all creativity is cursed, as a demonologist explains later on: “The demon prefers novel and personalised approaches to summoning. Those who create their own ritual with pure and true belief are often the most corruptible.”He’s Watching gets a bit listless and repetitive two-thirds in, then rallies as the kids try to decipher the object stashes and exorcise this invader. What this stir-crazy, cheeky and wise family album tells us is that true horror for self-authoring, first-person Generation Z seems to be the hectoring dictates of the boring old third person. He’s Watching is available on digital platforms on 17 October."
Summit Fever review – super-real mountain-climbing drama is dizzying experience,"With seemingly-authentic mountaineering sequences, this is a visually resplendent film about peak-scaling – just don’t look down at the plot",3,"There’s an eerie closeup in Summit Fever of hair rising on the wrist of lead character Michael (Freddie Thorp), prior to a lightning strike. Julian Gilbey’s mountaineering drama isn’t just visually resplendent, it also has an impressive tactile familiarity with its milieu – placing its actors on real rock faces on the Eiger, Matterhorn and Mont Blanc mountains – that results in super-authentic climbing sequences (at least to this non-climber). Too bad then that it fumbles its dramatic handholds with a risible sub-Point Break storyline about peak-scaling addiction.Thorp plays a Keanu-esque newbie who has quit his finance job to chase the Chamonix dream. Egged on by his loudmouth climbing partner JP (Michel Biel), Michael starts to push his limits on the region’s slopes, starting with the terrifyingly sheer Dent du Géant. And, despite initially being whipping boy for weathered American Leo (Ryan Phillippe), he fits right in with the young, dumb and full of kombucha hip local scene – including a budding hookup with piste-bashing French ski guide Isabelle (Mathilde Warnier).The climbing sequences are genuinely exhilarating: in monumental drone shots homing in on minuscule figures on rock faces and in blow-by-blow crag-side set pieces that demonstrate the film-makers know whereof they speak (even with the odd low-budget shortcoming, such as suspiciously light-looking boulders). And with lightning backlighting alpine vistas in the final storm sequence, you feel right alongside the climbers in a way that even Hollywood big-hitters such as 2015’s Everest struggle with.Best not look down at the story, though, which might have been able to stand up the cliched theme of adrenalised hubris if it hadn’t painted it so cartoonishly. Even the film’s expert free solo climber is at one moment lecturing about respecting the mountain, then arrogantly dynoing two seconds later. (Cue further philosophical finger-wagging from Phillippe, Swayzeing it up.) Warnier, in particular, is left stranded at sea level as the love interest. Aided by its physical clout, Summit Fever does hit a kind of rhythm near the end – but last year’s The Summit of the Gods is a more substantial look at this kind of obsession. Summit Fever is available on digital platforms on 17 October."
The Woman King review – Viola Davis leads the line in stirring warrior tale,"Davis is the general of an elite team of female fighters, based on the Agojie of 19th-century west Africa, as colonialists seek to exploit tribal conflict",3,"Director Gina Prince-Bythewood plants the bold flags of storytelling and myth-making with this stirring period action movie, inspired by the 19th-century west African kingdom of Dahomey (now Benin) and its Agojie, an Amazon brigade of female warriors tougher and more feared than any men: somewhere between a special forces unit and a praetorian guard for the king.Viola Davis plays Nanisca, the battle-scarred general of the Agojie: tough, disciplined and hyperalert for any sign of attack from their old enemy, the Oyo empire, and worried that the new king Ghezo (John Boyega), who has deposed his brother in a coup, is not sufficiently focused on these things. Nanisca’s loyal lieutenants are Izogie (Lashana Lynch) and Amenza (Sheila Atim) but she nonetheless finds herself strangely preoccupied by a new hothead recruit, Nawi (Thuso Mbedu), who has been effectively dumped on the military by an angry father on account of her resistance to marriage. As two Brazilian aristocrat slavers come to their country, eager to exploit the warring factions who each wish to sell off their prisoners of war into slavery, Nawi is to come of age as a warrior and make a terrible discovery about her past.The Woman King is an interestingly old-fashioned film, with hints of Gladiator and Braveheart, although there is something bracingly contemporary in Prince-Bythewood and her screenwriters Maria Bello and Dana Stevens tackling the way tribal warfare, insidiously encouraged by the imperialists, created the market forces for slavery – although Ghezo is now considering making the big business-model move from slavery to palm oil, which is lucrative and plentiful. This is a big, bold picture with the vivid presences of Davis, Lynch, Atim and Mbedu giving it some real voltage. I sometimes wondered if there wasn’t room for a more potent villain here, someone worthy to face off dramatically with the charismatic Davis: Boyega’s Ghezo is supposed to be flawed but there was perhaps room for a real antagonist to strike more sparks. Even so, this is a grand spectacle with vivid and theatrical performances. The Woman King is released on 4 October in cinemas."
House of Darkness review – Neil LaBute’s creepy-mansion revenge horror goes nowhere,"LaBute’s quarter-baked script tries but fails to satirise male attitudes, letting down his actors Justin Long and Kate Bosworth",1,"Writer-director Neil LaBute has created some genuinely challenging work for cinema and theatre, including the 90s toxic-masculinity classic In the Company of Men. But he takes his eye off the ball sometimes, and in this film the ball is so far outside LaBute’s eyeline, he might as well be outside the stadium trying to remember where he parked the car.House of Darkness is a tedious quarter-baked straight-to-video revenge horror set-up that is sort of – but not really – satirising male attitudes. Justin Long plays Hap, a guy who has just picked up Mina (Kate Bosworth), a young woman in a bar, assuring her that he is “separated” from his wife. This demure, white-clad young siren asks Hap to drive her home, which turns out to be a weird Castle Dracula mansion in the middle of nowhere. She asks him in to this creepy old-timey place and while she is gone in the kitchen fixing them both drinks, Hap can’t help gloating on the mobile to his friend about how he’s almost certain to score. With a sweet smile, Mina returns with the drinks giving no hint that she heard his ungallant comments. And after what feels like hours and hours and hours of tensely cutesy conversation and directionless non-action, the grisly main event finally kicks off.This feels like something LaBute wrote in an afternoon on the notes app on his smartphone while thinking about something else. It doesn’t even really have a plot or narrative development. Even the introduction of new characters doesn’t advance the action or make things interesting. It’s just set-up – and punchline. Then credits. This really is just streaming content to be sludged through your laptop or tablet. Long will always have a place in everyone’s heart because of his appearance in Galaxy Quest and Dodgeball, but this doesn’t suit him (or Bosworth) one bit. House of Darkness is released on 10 October on digital platforms."
The Cordillera of Dreams review – a haunting reflection on Chile’s brutal past,Patricio Guzmán’s documentary juxtaposes historical chaos with the eternal beauty of the mountain range that surrounds Santiago,4,"Documentary film-maker Patricio Guzmán returns to his great and tragic theme of exile – from his Chilean homeland, from his past, from a world that made a certain sort of sense before the brutal 1973 coup which unseated Salvador Allende and introduced a military despotism whose ugly consequences have never been resolved there. Like his 2012 film Nostalgia for the Light, which reflected on the vast beauty of the Atacama desert in central Chile and thegreat Paranal observatory, contrasted with the shabby dishonour of 73, The Cordillera of Dreams again finds the film-maker juxtaposing the historical chaos and despair with the eternal beauty and mystery of the landscape: in this case, the awe-inspiring “cordillera” or Andean mountain range that surrounds his home town of Santiago.Guzmán fled Chile soon after the coup and the cordillera’s vastness haunts his dreams and those of the many Chileans he interviews: artists, writers, scientists. Is its colossal unchangingness reassuring, or disturbing? Does it make Chileans’ human pain and injustice look irrelevant? Just as Paul Robeson’s Ol’ Man River just keeps on rolling along in the midst of racism and slavery, the cordillera just stands there in geological time, for hundreds of thousands of years, indifferent to the minuscule reversals of human history.Yet Guzmán finds in the cordillera something inspiring and energising: a thread of beauty and romance which energises him. He speaks to people in Chile who have kept the faith, including film-maker Pablo Salas, whose filming over 40 years has accumulated a vital archive of the people’s resistance to oppression, inhumanity and mediocrity. Guzmán is reticent on the subject of US involvement in the coup; I’d like to see him confront Henry Kissinger. This is rich and valuable testament to Chilean courage. The Cordillera of Dreams is released on 7 October in cinemas."
After Blue (Dirty Paradise) review – Kate Bush sci-fi fantasy is on another planet,"Bertrand Mandico’s trippy, erotic, preposterous odyssey is packed full of deranged details that could propel it to cult classic status",3,"‘You must kill Kate Bush!” The order is given on a planet far, far away. And so begins the odyssey at the centre of this trippy, erotic sci-fi fantasy, a film that looks like a horny music video from the 80s, neon-lit and smothered with glitter, the screen filled with erect nipples in quantities not seen since the early seasons of Game of Thrones. It’s French, of course, directed by underground film-maker Bertrand Mandico with such loopy abandon I could almost forgive him the film’s obscenely indulgent two-hour-plus running time.Kate Bush is not the Kate Bush. Her full name is Katarzyna Buszowska (Agata Buzek), and she’s a Polish outlaw on a post-Earth colony in space populated by women. (The men all died soon after arrival.) Kate Bush has one hairy arm (as furry as a werewolf’s), black pointy fingernails and a third eye in her, erm, vagina. She’s also possessed of an otherworldly beauty: imagine David Bowie, Tilda Swinton and Patti Smith fed through one of those facial morphing apps.The story makes about as much sense as you would expect. Kate Bush seduces a stroppy teenager, Roxy (Paula Luna), into saving her from execution. As punishment, Roxy is banished with her mother (Elina Löwensohn), and ordered to hunt down Kate Bush. But forget about the plot, which is a mere backdrop to the psychedelic planetary wildness Mandico has dreamed up. I could fill pages with the deranged details: the hairy caterpillar cigarettes that wriggle as Roxy smokes them; the male android that instead of a penis has tentacles like long flaccid fingers; a hot tub filled with erotic goop.After Blue is a preposterous film, easy to ridicule. But it’s surely already halfway to cult classic status – destined to play midnight slots, watched by students smuggling bottles of red wine into the cinema under their coats. After Blue (Dirty Paradise) is released on 7 October in cinemas and on digital platforms."
Ningla-A’na review – Australia’s greatest ever protest movie ,"The electric documentary from the frontlines of the first Aboriginal Tent Embassy is restored, rereleased and still unmissable 50 years on",5,"The great Australian protest documentary Ningla-A’na is returning to cinemas with a new restoration timed for the 50th anniversary of the film and its subject. Capturing the early days of the Aboriginal Tent Embassy – a hugely influential symbol of sovereignty that began as a beach umbrella erected by four activists (Billy Craigie, Tony Coorey, Michael Anderson and Bert Williams) in 1972 – it’s not just a historical document but a kind of evergreen clarion call and electric time capsule, burning with white-hot energy and a searing sense of purpose all these years later.The launch of the Tent Embassy marked the first time many saw First Nations people confronting the establishment. In Ningla-A’na we watch protestors congregate, march, occupy public spaces and clash with cops, including in one shocking sequence that became a widely seen and highly influential depiction of police brutality. This moment, as curator Liz McNiven wrote for the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia website, “brought international attention to Aboriginal people’s struggle for land rights and human rights” and even “fundamentally changed the way the world saw Australia”.Italian-born director Alessandro Cavadini structures the film – which was clearly made from inside the movement – around Indigenous voices. Given its message that black activists don’t need white spokespeople, it was an odd choice to open with an elderly white pacifist and former veteran, Jim Leacock, who comments about his life and attitudes towards war before finally moving on to the topic at hand, describing the push for Aboriginal land rights as “the most important direction we can take in helping to restore some of the injustice”.But then Cavadini takes to the streets and never looks back, capturing many engaging subjects and the intense feeling and fervour of what would become a watershed moment in Australian history. The coolest subject is probably the great Gumbaynggirr activist and artist Gary Foley, who is what they call in documentary land “great talent” – a pull-no-punches presence who is loquacious, charismatic and mad as hell. After a tetchy exchange with a well-dressed white woman, Foley discusses the need for the black community to represent themselves, criticising previous iterations of the movement for being “full of white liberal shits” and arguing “people like her fucked our movement up for 20 years”.Foley then responds to the suggestion that the movement may find more support from the wider community if he tones down his use of language. His retort is one for the ages. On the notion of obscenity: “You think that my language is obscene … I think that what is going on in the black communities in this country is obscene.” And on being offensive: “I find very, very, very offensive the fact that a black person in birth, if he sets one foot in a bloody thoroughfare, he will get his head kicked in … I find very offensive the highest infant mortality rate in the world in this country amongst black kids …. that’s offensive to me.”Ningla-A’na’s restoration took seven months to complete, cost around $40,000 and received crowdfunding support from financiers including Russell Crowe. The rerelease will hopefully introduce it to a new generation and bestow upon the film its rightful status as Australia’s greatest ever protest movie: so alive and so galvanising it seems to have its own electromagnetic force.There’s been some good protest documentaries in recent years (including The Tall Man, Defiant Lives, Brazen Hussies and Frackman) but nothing that registers with this sort of impact. And nothing that so vividly captures such a significant event in modern Australian history, when activists (among many other things) created, as Jennetta Quinn-Bates put it, “a deliberate reminder of the ongoing atrocities subjected to the oldest living culture on the planet” and a space where Indigenous people – in the words of Roxley Foley – can “heal something in themselves”.Cavadini takes a multifaceted approach to exploring activism, digressing from tumultuous footage to quieter moments exploring topics such as the role of feminism within the movement, the birth of modern Indigenous theatre, and the shocking state of Indigenous health, articulated in a powerful sequence by Professor Fred Hollows. Cavadini went on to co-direct another historically significant documentary, Two Laws, which introduced many white Australians to the concept of this country having two kinds of laws, one of course existing far longer than the other.With time maybe that production will also be restored and its presence renewed in the zeitgeist. For now all eyes should be on Ningla-A’na: the very definition of an unmissable Australian film, returning to the big screen like a clap of thunder.Ningla-A’na is playing in select theatres around Australia"
Mrs Harris Goes to Paris review – Lesley Manville is terrific in Mary Poppins-ish fun,Manville is utterly convincing as a wide-eyed chirpy cleaner who comes into money and sets her heart on a Dior dress in this 1950s-set charmer,4,"The last time we saw Lesley Manville in a fashion movie, she was playing the highly strung sister and business partner of Daniel Day-Lewis’s fastidious British couturier in Paul Thomas Anderson’s Phantom Thread. Now she returns in a very different fashion film set in very much the same era: the musty old 1950s, playing a chirpy London cleaning lady called Mrs Harris whose backdated war-widow pension kicks in at the same time as a win on the football pools (younger viewers may need to Google that), and she heads off to Paris with a big dream: to buy a beautiful Christian Dior gown.Wide-eyed Mrs Harris finds herself initially looked down on with haughty Gallic astonishment by the fashion house’s formidable director of operations Mme Colbert (Isabelle Huppert), who has no great wish to be addressed as “ducks”. But Mrs Harris’s innate charm and innocence wins everyone over. It is adapted from the 1958 novel by Paul Gallico in which she was “Mrs ’Arris” in its original American title: a condescension that this film corrects.There’s such a lovely sweet-natured sense of fun in this Cinderella tale, a multicoloured confection like something that Fortnum & Mason might put in the shop window. Manville carries it off with absolute conviction: she plays Mrs Harris’s naivety with just the right lightness, her determination with the right edge of steel, and her inner grief at the long-denied loss of her husband with the right seriousness and sadness.And there’s a terrific supporting cast giving it some zing both sides of the Channel. Anna Chancellor is hilariously awful as the mean Lady Dant, who has enough money to buy a staggering Dior dress (it is the sight of this garment that triggers Mrs Harris’s frock-yearning) but is too stingy to pay her cleaning lady what she owes. Ellen Thomas gives a lovely performance as Mrs Harris’s best mate Violet and Jason Isaacs comes close to pinching the whole thing as the rackety, cheery Archie, who is involved in greyhound racing. Once Mrs Harris makes it to Paris, she encounters the scary Mme Colbert (great tongue-in-cheek stuff from Huppert) but also the handsome, soigné Marquis de Chassange, played by Lambert Wilson, who appears to take a gallant shine to Mrs Harris, causing her to be all aflutter.Preposterous though it may be, this is a terrific family movie in a style audiences may not have seen since Mary Poppins. I hope it’s a box-office smash up to Christmas and beyond. Mrs Harris Goes to Paris is released on 30 September in UK cinemas and 27 October in Australia."
Amsterdam review – turn of the screwball in David O Russell’s starry muddle,"Christian Bale, Margot Robbie and John David Washington bring laughs to a exhaustingly wacky riff on a real-life fascist conspiracy in 1930s New York",3,"There’s usually a no more heart-sinking way of starting a movie than with the larky, slippery announcement: “Based on a true story – mostly!” or “What follows is all accurate – kinda!” It usually means the film will fall between the two stools marked “creatively interesting” and “factually informative”. However, David O Russell begins his elaborate screwball mystery Amsterdam by declaring: “A lot of this actually happened.” He means the film is a wacky riff on the little-known 1933 “White House putsch” in which a cabal of wealthy American businessmen conspired to overthrow President Franklin D Roosevelt, hoping to dupe a retired major general called Smedley Butler into leading their fascist veterans’ organisation. (Maybe the nearest British equivalent was Lord Mountbatten being approached in 1968 by a group of establishment grandees to unseat Labour prime minister Harold Wilson.)Amsterdam imagines three innocent veterans being drawn into these creepy shenanigans. Christian Bale plays Burt Berendsen, a disabled ex-soldier who lost an eye in the first world war; after The Big Short, this is Bale’s second “glass eye” role. Burt is a doctor in New York, supplying pain medication and prosthetic limbs to fellow veterans on a pro bono basis. Burt’s army pal Harold Woodman (John David Washington) is now a qualified lawyer, and helping him to run a morale-boosting ex-servicemen’s gala dinner. And the two men’s soulmate is the mercurial and brilliant Valerie Voze, played by Margot Robbie, who in the first world war was a volunteer nurse and dadaist artist who saved all the shrapnel she dug out of soldiers’ shattered bodies to create bizarre objet trouvé artworks.Valerie took Burt and Harold for a glorious bohemian retreat in Amsterdam where they did nothing but carouse, but then she mysteriously vanished. And now back in New York in 1933, Burt and Harold witness the bizarre death of a prominent US general’s daughter, and find themselves in the frame for murder; they need the help of another top soldier, General Gil Dillenbeck (Robert De Niro), and Valerie dramatically reappears.There are some great supporting turns here, which periodically break the surface of this film’s soupy strangeness. Rami Malek is very funny as Valerie’s wealthy, silken-voiced brother Tom, always charming and insinuating. Mike Myers is amusing as MI6 operative Paul Canterbury, who for no good reason in one scene does Wilson, Keppel and Betty’s “sand dance”, surely the first time this has been seen in the cinema since the opening scene to Julien Temple’s Absolute Beginners. Andrea Riseborough is elegant and stylish as Burt’s snobbish wife Beatrice, and Matthias Schoenaerts and Alessandro Nivola get laughs as two lumpen cops.As for the leads, the best is John David Washington, who pursues a policy alien to his costars: less is more. His performance is cool, unruffled and his address to the camera is very seductively underplayed. Bale and Robbie are doing bigger and broader comedy, and often there isn’t quite the material in the script to back it up – although Bale has a good bit when Burt takes a new, state-of-the-art morphine painkiller via eyedrops, starts talking about how unreliable these things are and then suddenly interrupts himself: “Oh that’s fast!”But there is something weirdly heavy and foggy in Amsterdam that feels like it’s working against the lightness and nimbleness needed for a caper. It’s the reality of the history, which the movie makes explicit in the closing credits: the grim fact of the US’s proto-fascism understandably means that the comedy isn’t going to be too lighthearted, although the obscurity of this story means that isn’t immediately clear. Well, there are some very good performances, and Washington has taken another step towards A-lister greatness. Amsterdam is released on 7 October in the US and UK."
"Smile review – grin and bear it in this queasy, nasty horror melodrama","A psychiatrist fleeing her own trauma discovers a grisly, self-replicating chain of destruction ",4,"If you’ve ever had this word addressed to you as an instruction, followed up with “… it may never happen!” you already know how grotesquely unnatural smiling is if you don’t feel like it. It’s much more difficult than pouting when you’re happy, a skull-grimace of misery, betraying the heartbreak within. Incidentally, I lost a bet with myself as to which Nat King Cole song would be ironically played over this film’s closing credits.Smile is a queasy, nasty horror-melodrama from first time feature director Parker Finn. Like David Robert Mitchell’s 2014 film It Follows, this takes an indirect inspiration from the MR James short story Casting the Runes, all about an unending DNA-replication of evil. It’s shot in a dull, blank, subdued light into which hallucinations and supernatural incursions can insinuate themselves without warning, together with unsubtly brutal but effective jump scares.Sosie Bacon (daughter of Kevin) plays Dr Rose Cotter, a consultant psychiatrist who has chosen to work in the most challenging environment possible: a hospital ER in which patients are invariably at their most violent and troubled. This is Rose’s vocation, stemming from a trauma in her own childhood, which she has effectively suppressed with elaborate professional calm. She is now engaged to a handsome young guy called Trevor (Jessie T Usher), having somewhat heartlessly broken off a relationship with Joel (Kyle Gallner), a cop who through a strange quirk of fate is called to attend when Rose faces the most terrifying case of her life. A deeply disturbed young woman is brought in, wretched with fear and lack of sleep, telling Rose about a hideously smiling demon that stalks her, inhabiting the bodies of various people: some are friends, some are random strangers. And then with a grisly self-destructive flourish, the awful smile itself breaks cover, and Rose realises that it is coming to get her too, and she faces a terrible choice if she wants to escape its curse.Smile is a movie whose influences are certainly detectable: we are, admittedly, close to Scary Movie territory, when we get closeups of the home-security-system keypad on the wall of Rose’s luxurious home, or scenes with her adorable pet, or horrible situations which turn out to be dreams from which the heroine awakens with an explosive gasp. But there is also something arresting about the central, nauseous motif. You see someone taking their own life and are from then on pursued by this grotesque, horrible smile. People who have witnessed something so intimately despairing and horrible have become somehow implicated without their consent in the most violent dysfunction and may indeed spend the rest of their lives toughing it out, smiling through their repressed pain. Yet this buried agony may well manifest itself in carrying on the chain letter of evil: being violent or self-harming with someone else.The movie is a shard of comic and cosmic spite, and the image of the malign smile carries force. Apart from MR James, I found myself thinking of the Kafkaesque short story that Billy Wilder wrote while working as a journalist in Berlin in the 1920s called Wanted: Perfect Optimist, about a man who gets a job in which all he has to do is sit in the office and smile continuously for eight hours a day; it soon becomes an existential ordeal of horror. As for this film, I found myself sheepishly grinning for some time afterwards. Smile is released on 28 September in the UK, 29 September in Australia and 30 September in the US.

Cages review – hologram rock musical is a dreary dystopia,"Riverside Studios, LondonAn overreliance on technology and a doomy score can’t replace old-fashioned chemistry in this emotionless offering",1,"Anhedonia is a condition that renders the sufferer unable to experience pleasure. In the rock musical Cages, which mixes live performance with holograms, film and animation, it is also the name of a grey dystopian city where the aesthetic is very Tim-Burton-meets-German-expressionism and any display of emotion is forbidden. Hiding in the shadows is the composer Woolf, who sees in Madeline, his pixie-ish muse, the prospect of true love. Can music help them overcome their obstacles?The most significant one facing Cages is the very technology that acts as its selling-point. Advance word suggests that state-of-the-art holograms – an improvement on the days when Laurence Olivier’s floating head was projected on to the stage of the Dominion theatre for Time – will be indistinguishable from live actors. But the disparity whenever Woolf (played in the flesh by CJ Baran) interacts with Madeline (Allison Harvard in virtual form) is all too obvious. No wonder the love story feels bloodless when it depends on hitting marks and matching sight-lines, rather than old-fashioned chemistry and rapport. It doesn’t help that the characters communicate via silent-movie intertitles, with a narrator (Harwood Gordon, another hologram) doing all the talking.Filmed crowd scenes showing ranks of secret police with metallic traffic cones on their heads (why?) only emphasise the meagreness of the in-person cast of eight. Baran, who co-created Cages with Benjamin K Romans, is a songwriter rather than an actor, and it shows — he has none of the physical expressiveness that could have made Woolf more than a plodding silhouette. The evening’s loveliest effect has virtual raindrops sploshing on a real umbrella.The score, also by Baran and Romans, is often reminiscent of 808s & Heartbreak-era Kanye West: lots of doomy synths, vocoder and introspection. Madeline’s refrain, Somebody’s Somebody, is a pale echo of Vanessa Williams’s Save the Best for Last, while a singing moon with a human face prompts memories of The Mighty Boosh. The one bona fide pop anthem (A Love Song) arrives too late to save a prog-heavy second act during which audiences will know exactly how it feels to have anhedonia. At Riverside Studios, London, until 1 January."
Lou review – Allison Janney gets her Taken but leaves us wanting,A welcome action lead for the Oscar winner is wasted in a Netflix kidnap thriller that underwhelms and exhausts,2,"The great Taken-ing of actors over 55, from playing dad to playing dad who is also a retired hitman, was a boon for the Neesons and Odenkirks and Costners but less so for their female counterparts, shuffled on from mom to mom who is also married to a retired hitman. Things seem to be slightly improving this year with more women of a similar age allowed into the action genre that has traditionally left them unarmed, with Michelle Yeoh and Viola Davis fighting their way to box office success (before Jamie Lee Curtis returns to “end” Michael Myers next month), and now, inevitably, Netflix is bringing up the rear with a more conventional vehicle, this time for Oscar winner Allison Janney.If only it wasn’t called Lou, a dreadfully silly title that’s hard to say out loud with any vague sense of excitement (just try it – Lou, Lou, Lou). It’s sadly also hard to watch it while feeling any vague sense of excitement or any sense of anything, really, a film that works best as a thrilling concept – Allison Janney does Taken – than a real thing.Janney plays, you got this, Lou, a gruff, self-sufficient loner living, or existing, in the woods, haunted by something or someone, an intentionally simple life until one night things get complicated during a particularly dramatic storm. The daughter of her closest neighbour, Hannah (Jurnee Smollett), has been, we got this, taken, and she needs Lou’s help to find her.Who is Lou? What is Lou? But most important, why is Lou? I haven’t a clue after an intermittently diverting but mostly unremarkable 107 minutes, a film unworthy of both Janney’s talents and our attention. Lou briefly teases that it’s really about something before yanking the veil from our eyes, holding up its hands and shrugging. The film had been originally set up at Paramount with JJ Abrams producing, a not-unimpressive origin tale given most of the guff that gets churned out over at Netflix, but why this script garnered such attention is perhaps the film’s greatest mystery.Described initially as Thelma & Louise meets Taken, Lou is a bit more like Sleeping with the Enemy meets Rambo meets Taken but sadly nowhere near as much fun as that might make it sound. The missing kid has been nabbed by an abusive ex, played with soapy menace that quickly froths out to nothing by Logan Marshall-Green, and the initial storm-set tracking scenes, forcing the women to club together, are efficiently engaging. Director Anna Foerster, whose TV credits include genre fare like Outlander and Westworld, knows how to stage action and set a mood (base level competency still counts for a lot in the streaming netherworld), and when Maggie Cohn and Jack Stanley’s script keeps things simple, there’s some equally simple fun to be had. Janney is, as ever, a true pro, and her wearied cynicism, most often used for comedic effect, makes her a believably haunted antihero, and Lou allows some quieter, weightier moments that her other work doesn’t always afford her.But there’s a dull, derailing twist that complicates and confuses, turning what could have been a tight little chase movie into something far baggier and far harder to get involved in. It edges the film into limp melodrama and takes us further away from the action, a misguided attempt to swap adrenaline with emotion. Janney sells it regardless, but by the end she’s literally and figuratively walking wounded. The sheer existence of Lou might be a step in the right direction for women over 50 in action movies, but it’s a misstep everywhere else.Lou is now available on Netflix"
A Jazzman’s Blues review – soulful Netflix drama is Tyler Perry’s magnum opus,"The divisive multi-hyphenate has delivered a surprisingly stirring period romance, a passion project for him that could spark a drastic career change",4,"Tyler Perry did not become a billionaire media mogul by making fine art. He did it by mass-producing plays, films and TV series about scorned Black women and their dysfunctional families who ultimately find succor in Christian lessons in forgiveness, dignity and self-worth. And as mesmerizing as it’s been to watch this New Orleans-born, former temp worker who never finished high school write, produce, direct and act in much of this work – not least as the tart-tongued, pistol wielding granny Madea – the work ethic didn’t exactly endear him to highbrow consumers who expected more of a 53-year-old Black man who rightly crows about opening one of the industry’s largest studio lots on a former Confederate army base that’s played host to everything from Marvel epics to Bad Boys for Life to Coming to America 2.Spike Lee would set the critical tone against Perry a decade ago, blasting his work as “coonery” and “buffoonery”. But when Perry, who got the last laugh by naming a sound stage after the She’s Gotta Have It director, took risks, the audiences for films like For Colored Girls weren’t nearly as robust as they were for the Madea franchise. “I would love to go do a movie that’s as powerful as Schindler’s List,” he told an audience at a Goldman Sachs conference four years ago. “I wrote a script in 1995 about a Holocaust survivor and a jazz singer. But I knew what I was building I had to focus on … so that I could build all these other things to stand on.”Here at last is that feature, A Jazzman’s Blues, which couldn’t be more unrecognizable as a Tyler Perry production. Gone are the overbearing religious themes, the risible wigs and the familiar rotation of company players burning through tens of pages of a day in single takes. (Brad Benedict, a supporting actor in the BET White House drama The Oval, was one notable exception.) Rather, this is a story that takes its time building characters and conflict over the course of two-plus hours before winding down with a wallop. If there’s anything to lament, it’s Perry’s decision to drop the film on Netflix instead of challenging the current box office’s weak crop. Jazzman isn’t just good for a Tyler Perry movie. It’s good full stop.Set in rural Georgia in 1940, Jazzman starts as a teen romance between family black sheep Bayou (Joshua Boone) and Leanne (Solea Pfeiffer), who is sent away to live up north after Bayou proposes marriage. Even though he goes on with his life (enlists in the service, dodges combat and returns home after suffering an injury), he still carries a flame for Leanne. And when she returns on the arm of a white scion of a political dynasty, it sends shivers through the Black community who knew her back when. Bayou knows she’s “playing a dangerous game”, but neither can resist the urge to reconnect. When Leanne’s diabolical mother, who sent her away to begin with, catches wind of the kids’ rekindled romance, she tells a lie that forces Bayou to skip town with his older brother for Chicago.That brother, Wille Earl (Austin Scott), was off to make his fortune as a trumpet player and had an audition (kind of) set up in the hottest room in town by his mysterious manager Ira (Ryan Eggold), a Holocaust survivor with acute survivor’s guilt. But as Bayou, a shy singer with a big voice, emerges as the much bigger talent, Wille Earl’s resentment deepens with his addiction to heroin. Like Leanne, Bayou is eventually lured back home to check in on his mother, whose thriving juke joint business grew fallow after he escaped town. The star-crossed lovers hitch another plan to ditch town again, this time with a baby in their party.Everything about this film is genuinely absorbing. The performances are restrained. The locations, many of them seemingly on the Perry Studios lot, are lush. The musical numbers are decadent, no doubt thanks to Perry roping in the multi-Grammy winning jazz composer Terence Blanchard, a longtime Spike Lee collaborator. The storytelling is efficient, the scenes well-paced, the command of social and racial politics ironclad. Perry never shows up on screen, in drag or otherwise. But his vast talent and resources shine through. And so does his heart.So Perry took 30 years to build an empire. In the end, there’s no doubt it was the right move. If he had tried starting his career with Jazzman, the world probably never sees the film at all, let alone in this stunning, unadulterated form. Perry not only fulfilled his promise – you could call this his magnum opus. But (and I can’t believe I’m writing this) his best might indeed be yet to come.A Jazzman’s Blues is now available on Netflix"
Chup: Revenge of the Artist review – a killer Bollywood horror to frighten film critics,A thriller that skewers the tense film-maker/reviewer relationship in this tale of a Mumbai serial killer out for revenge on careless journalists,4,"Director R Balki must have got a kick out of writing this very enjoyable poison-pen letter to film criticism in which a Mumbai serial killer stalks the practitioners of our noble profession. Se7en-style, the killer tailors the murders to the critique; woe betide the hack who thoughtlessly writes: “A picture whose heart is in the right place, but whose other organs are all over the place.” Not only is this premise a droll kick up the arse for the Scream-style meta-slasher, it has to be the first film in which someone says “I need a critic” in the same imperative tone usually reserved for a Swat team or an elite hitman.First for cancellation is the career-assassin journalist found seated on his toilet, scored around his torso with bloody grooves. Police chief Mathur (Sunny Deol) twigs that the triangle carved into his forehead is, in fact, an uncompleted star, and that the killer, the “critics’ critic”, is “rating” his victims. Meanwhile, Nila (Shreyer Dhanwanthary) is the new entertainment reporter on the Mumbai Post. A film fanatic who likes to live within earshot of the musical numbers emanating from her local studio, she seems to be falling into her own movie romance when she meets strapping florist Danny (Dulquer Salmaan). So far, so masala – apart for the fact that, in private, Danny holds Norman Bates-style conversations with himself.Balki, whose last film was the 2018 sanitary-towel comedy Pad Man, has a knack for a topical hook. Chup successfully skewers not just the tense film-maker/critic relationship, but knows perfectly where to put its finger to best needle Film Twitter: it calls out hot-take merchants, overly positive and corrupt reviewers, and this exalted calling’s self-importance. “I cannot live like this any more – like a terrorist attack,” says the wife of one critic under police protection. Balki even manages to make Chup’s disparate sides – the satirical police procedure and dulcet romance – work productively in tandem. The latter increasingly puts a bloody, ironic spin on Bollywood fantasy, as Danny turns out to be a fanboy of the lamented Guru Dutt, the celebrated writer-director who may have killed himself in 1964 at the age of 39 in the wake of the bad reception to his final film, Kaagaz Ke Phool.But as Amitabh Bachchan, cameoing, says: “Cinema needs fearless voices for its evolution”; someone has to tell Chup where it doesn’t quite click. Salmaan – though generally effective in his eerie affableness – clubs us over the head with the split personality stuff. The sound designer who came up with the bizarre mobile phone trill that accompanies significant plot points should be shot. And at well over two hours, the film stretches the plausibility of both his premise and the performances on the rack at the finish. Perhaps I should be more careful how I phrase things, but it’s a caustic and tasty film for the most part. Chup: Revenge of the Artist is released in cinemas on 23 September"
Hatching review – deliciously repulsive Finnish horror,A teenager harbours a monstrous secret in Hannah Bergholm’s clever psychological shocker,4,"The Scandinavian show home breeds monsters in Hanna Bergholm’s pitch-black Jungian fairytale, pungently set in a sunny Finnish suburb of towering pine trees and pristine picture windows. Siiri Solalinna plays Tinja, the henpecked daughter of a ghastly influencer mum, anxiously rehearsing her moves before a gymnastics trial. But Solalinna is also Alli, Tinja’s feral alter ego, who sleeps under the bed, emerging at intervals to terrorise the neighbourhood, variously biting down on local pets and rival gymnasts. Alli, of course, is a manifestation of adolescent rage. The film’s a bloodstained thesis on the divided self.So what if the psychological subtext is shoved to the fore and shouted loud? Hatching delivers as a straightforward horror as well, in that it’s deliciously repulsive behind the antiseptic facade. Bergholm gives us precision-tooled jump scares and creeping, clammy atmospherics; a malevolent mother and an insurrectionist child. Every unhappy family, Tolstoy said, is unhappy in its own way. This one, for instance, contains crazed crows and dead dogs."
Funny Pages review – teenage dreams and nerd fury fuel this hilariously grubby comedy,An obsessive young cartoonist adopts a seriously inappropriate role model in Owen Kline’s excellent feature debut,4,"The sweet stench of failure hangs like a cloud over Owen (son of Kevin) Kline’s excellent feature debut; a film so malodorous and barely house-trained that one is half-tempted to prop it outside by the bins. I liked this a lot. Funny Pages spins a hilarious tale from the fringes of the underground comics scene, powered by a wonderfully sour performance by Daniel Zolghadri as Robert, a teenage cartoonist who strikes out on his own.Working as a clerk inside a tatty district attorney’s office, Robert is stunned to discover that one of the deadbeat clients is none other than Wallace Schearer (Matthew Maher), the assistant colourist on some of his favourite old editions. In Robert’s eyes, Wallace is an unsung hero, a comic-book Picasso who has fallen on hard times. To everyone else he’s a walking disaster, the sort of wayward, cantankerous misanthrope who should on no account be invited to the family home for Christmas dinner.And yet Wallace, it’s alarming to note, is merely the principal weirdo in a rogues’ gallery of losers that runs the gamut from Robert’s twitchy best friend to the residents of a basement flophouse downtown. Each is fuelled by uncompromising nerd fury; each bent out of shape by their devotion to pop culture. These dreamers and schemers aren’t bad people, exactly. Like Jessica Rabbit, they’re just drawn that way.In cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema"
Moonage Daydream review – cosmic Bowie doc is a mind-blowing labour of love,"American director Brett Morgen’s kaleidoscopic collage of David Bowie’s life is a dazzling mashup of elegy, celebration and intimate portrait",5,"In a poetic piece made for the BBC in 1998 about the work of British artist Richard Devereux, David Bowie confronted “a deep and formidable mystery: I’m dying. You’re dying. Second by second, all is transient. Does it matter?” Those words circle around Moonage Daydream, threading in and out of Brett Morgen’s unfolding screen elegy. They bookend Morgen’s maximalist collage of Bowie’s life, work and thoughts – from disposable glam-pop culture to timeless matters of life and death via a kaleidoscopic montage of music, mime, painting, acting, animation and dance, all filtered through a cosmic wardrobe of ever-changing clothes, hair and teeth.“He’s smashing!” burbles a 1970s Ziggy fan, one of many who have waited tearfully at a stage door to catch a glimpse of their idol. On stage, Bowie performs All the Young Dudes and Wild Eyed Boy From Freecloud while cameras peer lasciviously up his silk-printed, polo-necked minidress. “Everything is rubbish, and all rubbish is wonderful,” says Bowie, another of the endlessly quotable found fragments that are the closest the film comes to narration. A little later, we hear of his “hotch-potch philosophy – I was a Buddhist on Tuesday and I was into Nietzsche by Friday”.There’s more than a touch of Julien Temple’s pop-culture car-crash aesthetic in the way Morgen, whose credits include the 2002 Robert Evans documentary The Kid Stays in the Picture and 2015’s  Cobain: Montage of Heck, uses fragments of films (Un Chien Andalou, The Wizard of Oz, 2001: A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange – all of which Bowie eagerly recycled in his songs and stage shows) to illustrate this multifaceted tale. Scenes from The Man Who Fell to Earth are juxtaposed almost indistinguishably with Cracked Actor, the documentary that first made Nicolas Roeg think he’d found his starman. Meanwhile, the studied awkwardness of early interviews stands in striking contrast to Bowie’s confidence on stage, confirming his claim that he felt most comfortable playing other people. Only later in life does he appear to find peace with himself.There is some fragmentary childhood backstory, including memories of his half-brother, Terry, who introduced him to Jack Kerouac and John Coltrane before succumbing to schizophrenia. But it’s the lives Bowie created, rather than the one he inherited, that are Morgen’s main focus. Thus we see him scissoring journals in an attempt to apply William Burroughs’s cut-up techniques to songwriting, and hear of his desire to strip away the past and discover new ways of recording with Brian Eno on the Berlin trilogy.While the overall progression of the film is broadly chronological, individual elements are shuffled for thematic effect. The intercutting of Rock’n’Roll Suicide with an account of Bowie’s most commercially successful period in the 80s (all marionette boxercise moves and Gloria Hunniford-style blond bouffants) drives home the point that, beneath the hits and sellout tours, this was “the vacuum of my life… I never wanted to be out there pleasing people”. More subtly, the keyboard stems from Cygnet Committee provide perfect accompaniment to images of the artworks Bowie once chose to keep private, while the drumbeats of Sound and Vision and the vocals of Absolute Beginners collide in “musical mashups” smartly designed and edited by Morgen, overseen by Tony Visconti.Is it definitive? Of course not. No two-and-a-quarter hour film could ever hope to contain Bowie’s labyrinthine legacy, and despite the exhaustive mining of rich archival material (some familiar, some revelatory), there are still plenty of roads for future film-makers to follow. What Moonage Daydream does manage to do is to share some of the adventurous spirit of its subject – a chameleon who wasn’t afraid of falling flat on his face while reaching for the stars. If Bowie’s career teaches us anything, it’s that no one can laugh at you if you’ve already laughed at yourself. Certainly his capacity for balancing seriousness with self-deprecation (“No shit, Sherlock!”) remained one of Bowie’s most endearing traits.Earlier this year, film director Duncan Jones (Moon, Source Code, Mute) tweeted that, although he had not yet seen this new film about his father’s life, “it absolutely has the blessing of our family” because “I know it was made with love”. It sounds cheesy to say so, but it is precisely that profound sense of love that shines through Moonage Daydream."
Ticket to Paradise review – Julia Roberts and George Clooney try their best as bickering divorcees,Ol Parker’s superstar vehicle ​has classic Hollywood screwball aspirations but winds up resembling a glossy corporate video,2,"One person’s paradise is another’s circle of hell, particularly if that person has an aversion to rich American tourists and movies that resemble glossy corporate videos. Such, sadly, is the case with Ol Parker’s Ticket to Paradise, which sends Julia Roberts and George Clooney to Bali where it proceeds to pose them beside the swimming pools and flower beds of a luxury island resort. One assumes that everybody involved had a fabulous time; the production amounts to a lavish paid vacation. How the rest of us benefit is anyone’s guess.Naturally the film is at pains to conceal its hand, merrily insisting that the protagonists are actually in Bali under duress and would really rather be doing anything other than guzzling cocktails and cavorting with dolphins. That’s because Clooney and Roberts play bickering divorcees, ostensibly on a mission to sabotage their daughter’s betrothal to a local seaweed farmer. But they’re kidding nobody, perhaps not even themselves, since the script makes it clear that these two are secretly still in love and that the upcoming wedding is not the real romance here. The course of true love rarely did run smooth – except in this instance, when it could be travelling on greased rails.Hold your nose and squint your eyes and you have an inkling of what Ticket to Paradise dearly wants to be: an old-school Hollywood screwball in the vein of The Awful Truth or My Favourite Wife. Maybe Cary Grant and Irene Dunne could have made this fly, although even they may have required more grit, more rigour and a director less easily seduced by every white sandy beach and golden sunset that he sees. Clooney and Roberts try their best but they’re finally not much more than decoration themselves, the filmic equivalent of plastic figurines on a cake.In cinemas on 20 September"
In from the Side review – gay rugby love story looks bruisingly authentic,"The setting of the London team is terrifically done, but the dull romance at the centre of Matt Carter’s film long outstays its welcome",3,"With help from a Kickstarter campaign, film-maker and rugby coach Matt Carter has made a poignant lo-fi drama about a gay London rugby team. It’s a film with some terrific real-feeling characters, the kind who speak in the way actual people do – they’d be binge-worthily watchable in a series on TV or a streaming platform, flawed and lovely. Here, a bit unfortunately, they’re relegated to the sidelines – B team to a romance between the film’s two least interesting characters.One of those two is Mark, played by obscenely good-looking former Emmerdale actor Alexander Lincoln. Mark is in an open relationship with his rich, arty-looking boyfriend, sharing a penthouse overlooking the Thames. They’re living the dream, but seem stagnant emotionally as a couple. Mark has recently joined gay rugby club, the South London Stags where he claps eyes on Warren (Alexander King), who is in a monogamous relationship with another teammate. In five minutes flat, Mark and Warren are slammed up against the wall of a toilet cubicle.It’s an annoyingly long film – well over two hours – and a goodish chunk of this time is spent watching Mark and Warren in hot, can’t-keep-their-hands-off-each-other clinches. The script gives us less about their emotional connection and to be honest, the will-they-won’t-they-stay-together drama is a bit of a snore. The best scenes are down the rugby club, portrayed with tremendous warmth as a happy-ish semi-dysfunctional family.I wanted to know more about captain Jimmy, the team’s Jürgen Klopp, who gives pre-match pep talks with deep emotional intelligence. And club comedian Pinkie (Pearse Egan) who has a lovely speech about hating rugby at school as a gay kid. The absolute grimness – or glory, if you see it that way – of grassroots rugby looks horribly authentic too. The cold, the mud, the terror of being charged at by four men who order XXL when buying T-shirts and look like extras in a Viking epic. In from the Side is released on 16 September in cinemas."
The Cancer Conflict review – poignant documentary on alternative cancer therapies,Two patients take sharply differing approaches as they attempt to beat life-threatening tumours on their own terms,3,"Released to coincide with World Cancer Research day, Thomas Meadmore’s tricky yet involving documentary follows two Britons going rogue in search of a better quality of treatment. Grant Branton, from Brighton, is a sometime biologist reeling after early tests spotted tumours in his bowels while missing shadows in his bones; Surinder Paul, landed with breast cancer, hopes to avoid a mastectomy by leaning hard into oils, juicing and cravatted energy healers – what oncological voice-of-reason Rob Glynne-Jones calls “quackery”. Both have taken their lives into their own hands, which notionally affords them greater control but also obliges them to take critical decisions – even fashion their own suppositories – on ever-dwindling energy reserves.It’s tricky because Meadmore largely detaches these subjects from any context beyond the rooms they’re in. (There’s nothing about Branton’s career as a commercials and music video producer, for example.) Emphasis is thereby placed firmly on the individual, but many viewers will want more about Branton and Paul’s precise relationship to the NHS, and – if they went private – how and how much they’re paying. (It’s unclear from what is shown, possibly reflecting the blurred lines of modern British healthcare.) As carefully applied voiceover takes pains to establish, these two are outliers: Branton’s Facebook interactions and a troubling encounter with a self-appointed American guru illustrate how close we are to the fringes of anti-science conspiracy theory.Yet both remain compelling figures, eliciting natural sympathy and concern as they eye the enemy within. (No melodramatic “fights” or “battles” here – just the humdrum reality of endless tests and meetings to reveal results of tests.) Alpha-adjacent Branton endures horrific coughing fits to reaffirm his love for wife Christine; while Paul has the advantage of a large, loving, supportive family, she’s evidently determined to go her own way. For his part, Meadmore bides ever-more-valuable time, monitoring his subjects’ ebbs and flows, allowing them to make their own choices and us to form our own opinions, before finally ensuring the facts of these poignant case studies speak for themselves. The Cancer Conflict is released on 19 September on digital platforms"
Strawberry Mansion review – quirky but endearing dreamscape sci-fi romance,Whimsical near-future tale sees a tax inspector sent to audit an elderly bohemian’s dreams fall in love with her as a younger woman,4,"This charming if decidedly silly sci-fi love story unfolds in a near future where clothes and home furnishings look much like the stuff we have today – while some of the tech equipment the props department came up with looks like the prizewinners at a primary school art fair. For example, there’s a headset people can put on as they go to bed, a mass of wires and twinkly fairy lights, which stops invasive advertising (designed to implant the desire for fried chicken or soft drinks) getting into the sleeper’s dreams. Another looks like a cardboard box with dials painted on it.Writer-director team Kentucker Audley and Albert Birney’s low-budget whimsy aesthetic, propelled by a gently satirical undercurrent, is of a piece with other independent film-makers on the smaller film festival beat such as Jocelyn DeBoer and Dawn Luebbe, whose quirky suburban fantasia Greener Grass had a release in the UK in 2019. The whole genre is a very refreshing change from slick, hyperrealistic CGI-led films, especially when, as Audley and Birney do here, film-makers use old-school animation techniques and 100-year-old camera tricks to create their dream worlds.Audley himself plays Preble, a tax inspector with a dashing trilby, who arrives at the pink homestead of an elderly bohemian lady named Bella (Penny Fuller). His job is to audit not just her income but the value of objects in her dreams, which he can access using some of the funky aforementioned tech because everyone’s dreams are recorded. Wandering around Bella’s dreamscapes, Preble falls in love with Bella as a younger woman (played by Grace Glowicki) and is intrigued by people he sees in her dreams that look like they’re covered in living grass like walking front lawns, or trailing fringes of videotape. Eventually, tragedy strikes and Preble goes deeper into the dream record for “years” – or just a long stretch of sleep – where he lives happily with young Bella on an island, inventing games with shells and eating vegetables they find in the sand. It’s like Audley and Birney have done a remake of Christopher Nolan’s Inception with only sticky-back plastic and a couple of wobbly green screens for effects.Beneath the crazy candy-coloured palette, there is actually some real human warmth in the love story, and the acting ensemble features some great comic performers in supporting roles, including Constance Shulman (Yoga Jones in Orange is the New Black) and character actor Linas Phillips (Manson Family Vacation) as a sinister “friend” who infiltrates many people’s dreams. Strawberry Mansion is released on 16 September in cinemas and on digital platforms."
"Alice, Darling review – Anna Kendrick compels in chilling relationship drama",Toronto film festival: A career-best performance from the Oscar nominee anchors a smart and sensitive look at emotional abuse,4,"“But he doesn’t hurt me though,” Alice insists to her two oldest friends, both staring at her with combined sadness and exhaustion. In the unsettling and unvarnished drama Alice, Darling, Alice’s boyfriend does hurt her but probably not in the ways we often hear about and definitely not in the ways we often see on screen.Films about domestic abuse tend to rely on the aesthetic shock of seeing someone physically hurt their partner, an undeniable gut punch but one that too frequently takes precedent over the more insidious and inescapable ways of exerting control over someone. There was a tough and troubling TV one-off called I Am Nicola in 2019 that saw Vicky McClure trapped in a toxic relationship that was heralded by a domestic violence charity at the time for the importance of showing how someone can be knocked down without a single punch. There’s an equally devastating and necessary grind to Alice, Darling, a buzz-free Toronto film festival premiere that deserves to have everyone talking.Alice is played by Anna Kendrick, an actor who doesn’t always connect with some of her overly cutesy comedic work but is exceptionally, hauntingly effective here, playing a woman frazzled by a particular brand of private anxiety. In the opening scene, she meets her two closest friends for dinner (Wunmi Mosaku and Kaniehtiio Horn), a girls’ night punctuated by the sounds of Alice receiving texts, each causing her eyes to blink a little bit faster or her fingers to tap just that bit louder. She’s in a relationship with handsome artist Simon (Charlie Carrick) and he likes to check in.While Alanna Francis’s intelligent and uncommonly subtle script doesn’t take long to show us that Simon is coercive, it keeps us unsure over just how coercive he might be. We’re shown less of his destructive perfectionism in action and more of the impact it has on Alice – obsessively manicuring, lecturing about the dangers of sugar, pulling out increasingly large chunks of her hair – and director Mary Nighy, daughter of Bill, making her debut, chooses to show us only the briefest flashbacks to Simon at his worst, a restraint that proves horribly potent, effect prioritized over cause. Alice’s friends invite her to a cottage out of town for a birthday celebration, just the three of them, and Alice relents, telling Simon she has to go away on a work trip. At the house, her behavior gets harder to tolerate, oscillating between nervy, difficult and confrontational, the anger and frustration that’s been building up with no place to go threatening to explode.It becomes an unintentional intervention as Alice’s relationship is suddenly dragged into conversations outside of the ones she has with herself. The nasty things she’s been conditioned to believe – that she’s selfish, that she’s unfair, that she should feel shame, that she’s just not good – combusting once air is allowed in. It’s a tough process and Francis avoids tired therapy tropes both in how she shows the jagged nature of Alice’s journey (steps forward and steps back alternating) and how the women speak to each other, with a bracing, often cruel, frankness that only the oldest of friends are allowed to have. It’s written with such depth of feeling and particularity that only experience can provide. The limited range of abuse narratives – which often feel filled in with basics learned from watching other abuse narratives – has led us to expect a type, perhaps withdrawn and lacking in confidence, usually wearing long sleeves to hide the bruises. But Alice is difficult, often incredibly annoying to be around, angry and spiky, forced to over-sexualize the way she looks rather than retreat. It’s a character written with an odd singularity we don’t usually see.Kendrick gives a performance of equal specificity; believably, uncomfortably consumed by the sort of deep-rooted anxiety that makes others feel just as on edge. It’s deeply unpleasant to see her spiral (the grimly over-emphasized sound design of her yanking out longer pieces of hair is truly wrenching) and with the actor recently speaking out about an experience of being with a psychologically abusive boyfriend not long before she signed onto the movie, it feels as if the pain and anger come from a real place. It’s her finest performance to date and while their characters aren’t given that much beyond the basics, Mosaku and Horn are both excellent, their every line and decision made to ring true, an authentic dynamic that leads to an incredibly moving moment of extreme protection in the last act.It’s a chilling little film, avoiding maximalism at every turn, a bold debut from Nighy (whose only real slip-up is a score that can feel dull and uninspired) and a difficult reminder of a difficult experience. The chill will linger for a while.In the US, the domestic violence hotline is 1-800-799-SAFE (7233). In the UK, call the national domestic abuse helpline on 0808 2000 247, or visit Women’s Aid. In Australia, the national family violence counselling service is on 1800 737 732.

"Sidney review – Poitier’s epic life story a paean to charm, talent and heroism","Directed by Reginald Hudlin, this Oprah Winfrey-produced documentary is an eloquent rebuke to the ‘sellout’ narrative that bedevilled Poitier’s stellar career ",4,"The inspirational story of Sidney Poitier is retold in this warm and thoroughly engaging documentary from film-maker Reginald Hudlin, featuring commentary from Oprah Winfrey (the film’s producer), Spike Lee, Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman, Quincy Jones, cultural critic Nelson George – and Lulu, Poitier’s costar in To Sir With Love. Most importantly, it includes a marvellous direct-to-camera raconteur performance from Poitier himself, recorded before he died in January this year. (It also includes some great archive TV material and chat-show clips, including of course appearances on Dick Cavett, without whom no documentary of this sort is possible and who surely deserves a documentary of his own.). Harry Belafonte, his great friend, ally and rival in the civil rights movement, now 95 years old, was evidently not well enough to contribute, but he too is captured in clips.Poitier came of age in the 1960s as a pioneering African-American movie star, in an era when society was loosening up: McCarthyism was on the wane, paranoia was declining, America’s white middle classes were waking up to civil rights and he was to prove a persuasive and charming ambassador for black rights with wonderful presence, dignity and Shakespearian bearing – although oddly, he never acted in Shakespeare.Poitier grew up in poverty in the Bahamas and has some wonderful anecdotes about his astonishment on visiting Nassau as a child and seeing a car for the first time – and also seeing a mirror for the first time, goggling at the duplication it created. On moving to Miami, he faced death threats and violence from the Ku Klux Klan, but moved to New York City, got a job as a dishwasher in a café where a kindly Jewish waiter helped him to learn to read, and he learned his sonorous voice from a white radio announcer.From there, Poitier found work in the American Negro Theatre and got a breakthrough movie role in Blackboard Jungle as a smart high-schooler. He was the black convict chained to Tony Curtis’s white convict in The Defiant Ones as they made their break from a prison van, gradually coming to like the white man and creating a mythic self-sacrifice when he throws himself from a moving train rather than abandon him: a gesture that still divides pundits even now. The slap he gave to a white man in In The Heat of the Night was a sensational moment. Poitier was upset to be later regarded as a safe “Uncle Tom” figure, but he kept working in the industry, transitioning to directing with resounding success.The documentary does a very good job in showing just how astounding Poitier’s self-invention was, considering his early poverty, a story almost Dickensian in its drama and romance. And Hudlin tells us about some movies in Poitier’s CV that may have been forgotten: like the very interesting Something of Value from 1957, another black/white pairing (this one with the Rock Hudson), set in Kenya at the time of the Mau Mau uprising. It is a far more confrontational film, with Poitier in a more brutal and less emollient role, which has been allowed to disappear.This documentary is a spirited rebuke to the “sellout” narrative which has been allowed to grow up around his career, and a paean of praise to his commitment, talent and heroism. Sidney screened at the Toronto film festival and is released on 23 September on Apple TV+."
"Causeway review – Jennifer Lawrence makes a quick, stylish recovery in glossy drama ",A soldier with a serious brain injury takes a jarringly smooth and photogenic road back to health in this glib tale,2,"Some perfectly good, sincerely intended performances and well-meant ideas don’t do quite enough to correct the glibness and triteness in this self-conscious drama set in New Orleans. Jennifer Lawrence plays Lynsey, a serving soldier in the US military who has been sent home from Afghanistan, suffering from a traumatic brain injury after the explosion of two roadside bombs. Lynsey now has anxiety, disorientation, memory loss and physical coordination issues.After therapy from a kindly nurse, Sharon (Jayne Houdyshell), Lynsey has to live with her mom, Gloria (Linda Emond), who is a bit of a drinker and perhaps not providing the exact environment she needs. To the astonished dismay of her physician and family, Lynsey is keen not merely to get better, but to get better enough to redeploy, to go back into the army and see action once again in Afghanistan. She associates New Orleans with a grim world that might drag her down the way it dragged down her drug-abusing brother; the army got her out of there and she is ready to risk everything once again on the field of battle. At least now she has a friend: the sweet-natured, worldly-wise guy who fixed her truck, James, played by Brian Tyree Henry. Like Lawrence, he delivers a decent performance.But there is something a bit too smooth about the brain injury from which Lawrence’s character is supposedly suffering, with its lack of unsightly symptoms or visible wounds. She also keeps on going swimming in the pools she has a job cleaning. The movie starts with some ostentatiously tough scenes: Lynsey is almost catatonic with depression, she uses a wheelchair, she can’t brush her teeth and the nurse has to help her on and off the lavatory. And then, yes, Lynsey is supposed to have improved through therapy – a kind of off-camera single-transition montage leap from illness to near-recovery. Now, despite a few picturesque glitches, she has no serious physical problems.Then there are all the pills she has to take. Lynsey is not supposed to drink alcohol on those. But she rashly has some beers with James. Uh-oh. What’s going to happen? Well, it could be argued that the wrong choices and the insensitive moves she makes around James are down to drinking on medication. But again, this looks like another risk-free plot contrivance which never lets Lawrence behave too badly or too unattractively.Everything about this film means well and it is acted with professionalism and commitment. But there is something too easy about it. Causeway screened at the Toronto film festival and is released on 4 November on Apple TV+."
Bros review – Billy Eichner’s all-LGBTQ+ romantic comedy is a winner,"The comedian’s glossy, Judd Apatow-produced queer comedy is incredibly funny and insightfully smart",4,"Billy Eichner’s slick Judd Apatow-produced gay comedy, Bros, carries with it the specific sort of baggage that only a “first” is forced to carry. As the first theatrically released studio gay rom-com, the first studio film co-written by and starring an openly gay man and the first studio film with a majority LGBTQ+ cast, it’s a light movie made heavy with expectation – will it be gay enough or good enough or accessible enough or profitable enough – an unfair yet unavoidable heap of crosses to bear.Eichner is of course acutely aware of this and so is his film, through-lined with fears over the difficulties of making gay art, how to feel important as a gay person and how to exist and excel in a culture dominated by straight people (should we beat them or join them?). His comedy, best known from Billy on the Street and the short-lived series Difficult People, has always been intense and anxiety-ridden, he has a nervy energy that’s uncomfortably infectious to watch (“Name a woman!”), and it tracks that his first film as a writer would be also filled with existential gay angst.His character Bobby is a version of himself just a few degrees to the left – a successful podcaster who prides himself on being single and self-sufficient, existing on the intimacy of friendships and the brief pleasure of random hookups while balking at the ways that other gays choose to define themselves and their romantic lives. He rolls his eyes at marriage, throuples and shirtless circuit party gym bros – that is until he meets one of them, who upends his expectations. Aaron (Luke Macfarlane) is introduced to him as hot but boring and so Bobby is surprised when he finds something more substantive and slowly romantic. The two men, who have chosen a life devoid of commitment, have to navigate how the alternative might work.There’s a tension throughout Bros between making a gay film and making The Gay Film We Need Right Now, the micro vs the macro, and it’s something that takes Eichner, and co-writer/director Nicholas Stoller, some time to iron out. In the opening stretch, a few too many lines of dialogue feel closer to Twitter takes, plainly stated “the thing about … is” witticisms, a strain to always be “saying something” rather than just speaking. But Eichner’s confidence in how he chooses to get his many points across soon grows, embedded within the plot with more dexterity. And when the balance between the rom, the com and the commentary works, Bros really flies.One of Billy-Bobby’s complaints about the increased acceptance of gay culture – the assertion that love is love, that gay relationships are just the same as straight ones – is something that the character and the film around him are eager to disprove. Despite the gloss and the wide release that Bros is about to be given, Eichner isn’t that interested in pandering to straight audiences, to over-explain what poppers are or what Grindr is or worry if he’s putting them off. He trusts them enough to figure it out or if they don’t, he’s too busy elsewhere to care.There’s rich detail in the small character moments, like both men sadly recalling the jobs they wanted to have as kids before they worried about how gay that would make them seem, and unlike so many other loosely autobiographical concoctions that have been more clouded by ego, he’s willing to make his character believably unlikeable at important moments. I’d argue he could have been a bit harder on himself, especially in the grand romantic apology-filled finale which falls a little too heavily on the shoulders of the other bro, but in a subgenre filled with writers creepily insisting their loveliness, it’s better and knottier than the norm.Eichner also manages to make a surprisingly convincing segue from comedy bit-player to leading man, not just delivering on the many funny moments (toning down his trademark manic delivery is key) but doing a more-than-competent job at the messier stuff too (there’s a particularly effective monologue on the beach in Provincetown about being seen as “too gay”). Inevitably Macfarlane’s bro gets a little less texture and at times his existence and some of his dialogue borders on fan fiction (he tells Bobby how incredible he is on numerous occasions but the same is rarely said back to him) but the actor, a Hallmark Channel stalwart, makes for a charming vision of what a dream boyfriend could be. The supporting cast, made almost entirely of LGBTQ+ actors (bar two smart cameos from Debra Messing and Kristin Chenoweth and some other surprises at the end), are strong in small bursts, and the scenes of Eichner warring with other group representatives in the fight to open an LGBTQ+ museum are very amusing.Pairing Eichner with Forgetting Sarah Marshall’s Stoller, who knows how to deliver a crowd-pleasing studio comedy, gives Bros that sleek efficiency that comes with the best Apatow productions, the familiar mixture of genuine laughter, cutting insight and sugar-free warmth (it also has the slightly baggy runtime that has become a less desirable ingredient). It’s big and clever in a way that so few films of this scale are these days – a pleasure to be shepherded through the easy motions of a romantic comedy by people who know what they’re doing for once, and manages to walk a difficult tightrope without falling, despite the heft of baggage. It might not be The Gay Film We Need Right Now (is anything worthy of that title?) but it’ll be one that many of us will want instead.Bros is screening at the Toronto film festival and will be released in the US on 30 September and in the UK on 28 October"
Allelujah review – sweet but slight Alan Bennett hospital drama,A-listers are tended to by formidable nurse Jennifer Saunders in Richard Eyre’s adaptation of the 2018 play about a struggling geriatric hospital,3,"Bethlehem Hospital is the legendary institution which gave rise to the word “bedlam” – its name has been reapplied, without obvious irony, to a fictional geriatric hospital in Yorkshire for this gentle, shrewd ensemble comedy, adapted by screenwriter Heidi Thomas from the much-admired 2018 stage play by Alan Bennett with a new Covid-aware coda bolted on to the end. Richard Eyre directs with a sure hand.The “Beth” is a small community facility which has attracted donations from celebrities after whom various parts of the building are named: the film is mostly set in the Shirley Bassey ward. But it is facing closure from hardfaced Whitehall bean-counters who want giant cost-efficient hospitals or glitzy “centres of excellence” with measurable success rates. Humble, unglamorous geriatric care is however about vulnerable patients who are heading just one way, and their treatment crucially involves kindness and compassion which have nothing to do with the bottom line.Russell Tovey plays Colin, a Department of Health consultant with precisely these prejudices who has to come and visit his ailing ex-miner dad Joe (David Bradley) at the Beth, a cantankerous old guy who has never been able to accept his son’s identity as a gay man. There are no prizes for guessing if Colin’s attitude to both the hospital and his dad is going to thaw – and indeed his initial, shrill attachment to the government line is rather broadly written.Elsewhere on the ward, Judi Dench plays Mary, a retired librarian with a passion for cataloguing rather than books, but a keen interest in marginalia: the readers’ revealing scribbles at the side of the page. More genuinely bookish is the haughty former teacher Ambrose (he prefers the antique word “schoolmaster”) played by Derek Jacobi who broods over the Charles Causley poem Ten Types Of Hospital Visitor. Julia McKenzie is a woman with dementia whose daughter and son-in-law are desperate to keep her alive for a few more months for inheritance tax reasons (again, a slightly broad characterisation, which might have worked better on stage than on screen). Jesse Akele is the indomitably cheerful Nurse Pinkney. Bally Gill plays the genuinely caring Dr Valentine and Jennifer Saunders is the formidable, no-nonsense ward sister Gilpin who runs a tight ship.Perhaps the thought of a veteran Brit character-actor lineup in a care setting is a little mawkish, and I incidentally still have grim memories of Dustin Hoffman’s unsufferably patronising 2012 film Quartet with Maggie Smith, Tom Courtenay, Pauline Collins and Michael Gambon.But this watchable, undemanding drama rolls along capably, enlivened by unmistakably Bennettian gags and drolleries which come along every minute or so. Marvelling at a new invention called an iPad, Dench’s librarian purrs: “It’s no thicker than a monthly periodical!” Colin asks the work experience kid (Louis Ashbourne Serkis) wheeling around a trolley of large-print books: “Do you want to feel my feet?” The sullen teen replies: “It’s not top of my list.”The ostensible purpose and meaning of the film is of course to proclaim the value of the NHS, although you might argue that this faith is slightly deflected or undermined by the big narrative reveal – inspired by well-attested real life cases. But the new Covid section at the end, with its unexpected pivot to drama and crisis, works well enough. A low-key, attractive, if minor Alan Bennett. Allelujah screened at the Toronto film festival and is released on 17 March in UK and Ireland. This article was amended on 11 September 2022. An earlier version mistakenly referred to Julia Foster instead of Pauline Collins."
Pinocchio review – Zemeckis and Hanks reunite for well-made yet cold remake,A live-action take on the classic animation has effective visual moments and an impactful turn from Tom Hanks but never quite justifies its existence,3,"Pinocchio has long been a misfit within the classic Disney canon – the early animated films which solidified Walt Disney’s reputation as a master storyteller and formed the bedrock layer of American cinematic fairytales. You’re hard-pressed to find someone who claims the 1940 original, the second animated feature ever made by Disney, as their favorite. Many found it to be frightening and unsettling, myself included. It’s a weird story, this tale of a sentient wooden puppet who dreams of being a real boy and, among other things, witnesses rogue children transform into donkeys and gets swallowed by a whale.So it makes sense that the inevitable (for business reasons) live-action remake of Pinocchio will bypass theaters and head straight to Disney+. It is an odd fit, less hyped than its live-action cousins, neither quite a children’s movie nor a children’s movie for adults. There’s a strangeness to the whole proceeding – an unbeloved classic, sanded down from the original 1883 novel by Italian author Carlo Collodi, updated into a 1 hour, 40-minute visually stimulating but emotionally dull mishmash.Disney’s live-action churn through the catalog has resulted in, at best, faithful adaptations that struggle to capture the magic of animation (The Lion King, Aladdin) and at worst, unsolicited cash grabs reaching deep into the uncanny valley (Dumbo, Lady and the Tramp). Pinocchio, directed by Robert Zemeckis from a screenplay by Zemeckis and Chris Weitz, leans more toward the former, though it’s hampered by the fact that it’s just never not weird, on a visual level, to watch a CGI wooden puppet interact with real humans.The film’s central draw is the reunion of Zemeckis with Tom Hanks, as lonely woodshop owner Geppetto, and Pinocchio does offer hints of the sentimental kryptonite that carried their previous collaborations – Forrest Gump, Cast Away, The Polar Express. Hanks is the platonic ideal of a pathos figure for children, and you cannot help but root for him acting valiantly amid the CGI, trying and occasionally succeeding to anchor this story of a talking puppet to real human emotion. The film is most effective when Hanks fully throws himself into the role of a lonely man who has lost his child – a real boy, once, and now a wooden one – and desperately wants to be a father again.That wish, from “the depths of his heart”, comes true through the magic of The Blue Fairy (Cynthia Erivo), shrouded in misty CGI glitter and, again, an odd visual fit between naturalistic Geppetto and animatronic Pinocchio. (Erivo does remind, beautifully, that When You Wish Upon a Star, the signature song of Walt Disney productions, originated from the 1940 film.) The fairy tasks the boy puppet (Benjamin Evan Ainsworth) with developing a conscience, and assigns wizened Jiminy Cricket (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, voice pitched upwards) with handling moral duties until then. Jiminy, who I must note looks, disconcertingly, more alien than insect, also serves as the narrator and thus the main interlocutor between modern dialogue and the 19th-century setting – for kids and for parents (“well of course there are other ways to make a real boy, but I don’t think Geppetto gets out much,” he tells the Blue Fairy).Other moments gesture to the present day, and particularly the conscience-shredding specter of fame. “To be famous is to be real,” the two-bit, fox-headed scammer Honest John (Keegan-Michael Key) tells Pinocchio, luring the boy with fame and the chance to “be an influencer”. A scene in which Pinocchio flails onstage to uproarious laughter in a puppet show run by the monstrous Stromboli (Giuseppe Battiston) suggests a meta-commentary on exploitative spectacle. You can see echoes of a Twitter pile-on in the “contempt corner” of the Coachman’s (a devilish Luke Evans) deceptive Pleasure Island for destructive, conscience-free children.None of these are offensive or off-key, more awkward and ineffective, particularly for a story whose central character lacks much characterization or charm; until the final act, poor Pinocchio is mostly buffeted by the machinations of others. (I spent a lot of this movie feeling bad for Pinocchio, gullible and perpetually confused.) This is mostly a Pinocchio story problem, and Zemeckis’s film makes up for it somewhat in craft – the spectacle of Pleasure Island is visually dazzling, same for Pinocchio and Geppetto’s escape from the whale. Geppetto’s CGI cat, Figaro, grows from distractingly false to endearing, same for a helpful seagull named Sofia (Lorraine Bracco). Most of all, Kyanne Lamaya stands out as Fabiana, an invented character who befriends Pinocchio at Stromboli’s show; her communication with him via actual marionette is by far the most convincing and moving puppet-human interaction in the film.Often, it’s hard to know what to blame when the Disney live-action remakes fizzle. Is it that animation allows for a suspension of belief that human actors can’t sustain? An issue with the source material? An air of corporate strategy to the whole thing? In the case of Pinocchio, it’s a combination of all three. Either way, something is off – the film is competently crafted, dutifully acted, clearly labored over with soul, and yet, like its star, lacks a beating heart.Pinocchio is now available on Disney+"
Identification of a Woman review – Michelangelo Antonioni’s midlife crisis of a movie,"Antonioni’s 1982 film, in which a sexually restless middle-aged film-maker auditions young women, feels dated but has pleasing flourishes",3,"Michelangelo Antonioni’s long slide from critical favour may or may not be reversed by the re-release of this late work from 1982, a midlife or latelife crisis of a movie that Antonioni made at the age of 70 and was his last serious solo directorial work. (I would much prefer to see a revival of his tremendous and neglected film The Lady Without Camelias from 1953.)Anyway, this revives his signature themes – metaphysical mystery, existential anxiety, sexual obsession – and there are some definite, pleasing flourishes. But unfortunately, as with the later movies of Fellini, there are some softcore sex scenes and a preposterously romanticised and eroticised search for the ideal (and sexually available) woman; the concept of the sexually restless middle-aged film-maker auditioning young women to be in his movies jars a little.Our hero is Niccolò, played by Tomas Milian, a movie director who is broodingly between projects and creatively blocked. One day he finds himself at the office of his sister, a gynaecologist; she is frantically busy, so he good-naturedly helps out by taking a call from one of her patients, a beautiful, aristocratic woman called Maria Vittoria, or “Mavi”, played by the glacially charismatic Daniela Silverio. Simply attracted by the sound of her voice, he impulsively finds her number from his sister’s appointments book, calls her and they soon begin a passionate affair. This bizarre and highly inappropriate advance might in the hands of another director be the subject of worldly black comedy. And – who knows? – Antonioni maybe intended, at some level, a kind of deadpan comedy in it. But comedy would be the enemy of this film’s eroticism.Soon Niccolò detects hostility among Mavi’s patrician friends and family; there are shadowy threats from an anonymous goon hanging around in the streets and eventually the entrancing Mavi simply disappears, after which Niccolò tries to find comfort with another woman, Ida (Christine Boisson), with whom he has a (stylishly photographed) interval in wintry Venice. But she turns out to be pregnant with another man’s child and that relationship also ends in calamity, leaving Niccolò to ponder his desolate idea for a science-fiction movie featuring an asteroid heading inexorably out into space.Perhaps the most distinctive scenes are those in which Niccolò attends a very grand black-tie affair with Mavi, and senses a blank, unreadable hostility among all the grand people present. They have that same jaded, eerie ennui to be seen in other Antonioni films with a party scene, and it is intriguing to contrast them with formal scenes in a Buñuel film. Buñuel might invite the audience to step back and savour the surreal absurdity of these ritualistic events, while Antonioni wants you to step inside and inhale the unwholesome, oppressive atmosphere.Identification of a Woman is a movie from which there may not yet be quite enough historical perspective to turn its datedness into period charm. Yet the strangeness and haunted anxiety is potent. Identification of a Woman is on digital platforms and Blu-Ray from 12 September."
The Son review – laceratingly painful drama of familial fear and loathing,"Florian Zeller’s follow-up to The Father features a tremendous performance from Hugh Jackman, as a divorced lawyer who agrees to look after his troubled offspring",4,"Florian Zeller has already devastated audiences in 2020 with his movie The Father, based on his own stage play and adapted by Christopher Hampton, with Anthony Hopkins as the old man being cared for by his daughter played by Olivia Colman while he succumbs to the tragic endgame of dementia. Maybe the title of Zeller’s new film The Son – again from his own play with a Hampton screenplay – provides a kind of emotional rhyme or complement to that.The Son is a laceratingly painful drama, an incrementally increased agony without anaesthetic. At the centre of it, Hugh Jackman gives a performance of great dignity, presence and intelligence as Peter, a prosperous New York lawyer whose life is enviable: he is divorced (that situation being now amicable enough), remarried with a baby son, and on the verge of a political consultancy which might give him some sort of superstar future role in the White House.But then his first wife gets in touch saying that his 17-year-old son by their relationship is deeply depressed, playing truant from school and begging to stay with him for a while. Peter decides he can’t honourably refuse; his new wife decides she can’t refuse her husband - and everything is to lead to darkness without anyone ever being able to tell if they did the wrong thing, if there was a right thing to do or a right turn to take, or if the nature of mental illness means that this is all irrelevant anyway. Vanessa Kirby plays Peter’s new wife Beth; Laura Dern is his first wife Kate; Anthony Hopkins has a cameo as Peter’s formidably angry father and the young Australian actor Zen McGrath is Peter’s troubled son Nicholas.The Son is a beautifully composed and literate drama with impeccable performances, especially from Jackman: the sleek Manhattan lawyer gleaming with corporate prestige in his corner office (the faint unreality of the studio sets with the city’s diorama beyond the window work in the movie’s favour). But small things betray his internal pain: his handsomeness is etched with strain and he has never shaved properly: a stubble of sleeplessness and anxiety shows through.I am not certain quite what I think about this film’s Kodak-moment flashbacks to happier times or to the final scene: it packs a sledgehammer punch, no doubt about it, but I also felt something too slick in it, a conjuring trick played on the audience’s emotions, a legerdemain which doesn’t have the meaning of the POV-shifts and reality-erosion in The Father.Watching The Son means uneasily pondering possible influences, such Lionel Shriver’s We Need to Talk About Kevin, or Philip Larkin’s This Be the Verse, or indeed Anton Chekhov’s dictum about what happens when a certain object is produced in act one. But there is something distinctively Hellerian in its pessimism. Peter accepts Nicholas into his now crowded home because it is the right thing to do, but also because at one level he wants to rebuke his own cold and uncaring and irresponsible father – and in fact engineers an unannounced visit to the old man, clearly just so he can tell him what is happening with Nicholas and then use that as a pretext to dredge up the past.Dern shows how Kate herself is over their breakup only in the sense she is able to accept it rationally, but if anything has a clearer sense of her grievances – and is perhaps not entirely displeased that young Nicholas could now damage or even destroy Peter’s remarriage. Kirby shows her candid fear of Nicholas – who is sometimes charming, sometimes unsettling – and Nicholas himself is candidly angry about the way his father abandoned him (as he sees it), but his attitude is different; he wants something in return for a ruined past.But what? Does he want to bring them back together: if so, it seems to be working, in its way, but at what cost? Or is he simply transfixed and horrified, in a way that adults learn to suppress, by the terrible and unjust irreversibility of the past? Or is he just psychologically disturbed in ways that do not admit of analysis?At a level deeper than this, I think The Son is about the middle-aged generation’s fear of and incomprehension of the young. Peter looks into Nicholas’s face – sometimes smiling, sometimes crying, sometimes eerily blank – and can see nothing there that tells him the truth about what his son is thinking and feeling and what he should be thinking and feeling in return. Again: I’m unsure about that showy final scene. But this is such a powerful and literate film. The Son screened at the Venice film festival and is released on 17 February in the UK."
"Barbarian review – gory, secretive horror is all bark, no bite",A committed performance from Georgina Campbell is a rare highpoint in a competently made yet increasingly frustrating shocker about a sinister basement,2,"The campaign for gnarly, mostly one-location horror Barbarian has been scarily subdued. Just the one trailer – light on plot, heavy on mystery – and that punchy one-word title, a rare example of restraint, crafty less-is-more marketing we don’t see often enough in the exhausting era of trailer teases, teaser trailers, trailer countdowns, digital trailers, extended trailers and final trailers.I’m going to remain as tight-lipped about the specifics, and not just because a strictly worded pre-screening email insisted upon such, but because there are depressingly few pleasures to be had here, and one of them is at least, for a while, playing detective trying to figure out just what on earth is buried at its centre. It’s in the opening stretch, the set-up laid out in the hugely effective preview, that this game works so well.It’s late, and Tess (Georgina Campbell) is arriving at her Detroit Airbnb in the middle of a rainstorm, only to find that there’s someone already in it. Double-booked Airbnbs have weirdly become something of a trend of late, from Katie Holmes’s Covid comedy Alone Together to Winona Ryder’s gonzo thriller Gone in the Night to last week’s Netflix romcom Love in the Villa, but it’s explored with the most thought-through detail here, the awkward ins and outs of how to then cope with such an aggravating clerical error (or is it? etc). Tess is stuck with Keith (Pennywise himself, Bill Skarsgård), who is being disarmingly nice about it all, and after realising that other options aren’t possible for the night (a convention is in town and hotel rooms have all been snapped up), she reluctantly agrees to stay.It’s obviously a recipe for disaster, but writer-director Zach Cregger initially works hard to sell us on the “nope” of it all (Tess even says “nope” at one point, when considering a risky move). She takes a picture of his ID, she locks the bedroom door, she refuses to drink anything she hasn’t seen him prepare, she’s … aware of the danger she could be in as a woman (the two have a discussion about the differences they face in such a situation). It then makes the ensuing descent into the basement and into full horror that much more mystifying, as Tess, a recently smart and careful woman, turns maddeningly dim-witted, acting in ways that make no sense outside of the construct of a horror movie written by someone unable to find justifications for why a character would act so foolishly. Each eye-roll and head-shake takes us further away from the film, losing us and any real suspense, characters downgraded to chess pieces.The reveal of what lies down below is less surprising than the structure Cregger then chooses to deploy as we are taken to different periods, locations and viewpoints (there is more Justin Long than one would expect), interestingly bold until one realises such diversion is merely that, a way of distracting us from what is essentially a pretty ineffective monster movie. It’s competently made (Cregger could perhaps work better with a script he hasn’t written) but curiously flat, and in recalling films from Don’t Breathe to The People Under the Stairs, only serves to remind us how devoid this is in comparison.The way Cregger casually drifts close to hot-button topics and then decides to avoid them completely could almost be a knowingly middle-fingered statement on how he’s deliberately choosing not to fall into the “elevated” horror trap, the what-if-we-just-lived-in-a-society option over what-if-I-told-you-how-we-all-lived-in-this-society thesis. But even that extremely generous reading would require a writer-director with a firmer hand on his material, and here it feels more like someone blindly throwing a net out wide, hoping something might get caught in the process. It’s a defiantly unscary lump of Midnight Madness schlock that gains nothing from showcasing an awareness of the #MeToo reckoning or the damage of gentrification other than box-ticking.It’s a shame that Campbell, an actor of immediate intimacy and warmth, hasn’t found a breakout more deserving of her talents. I’m still haunted by her devastating, Bafta-winning work in Paul Andrew Williams’s BBC3 drama Murdered By My Boyfriend, one of the most effectively gut-wrenching and nuanced stories I’ve ever seen of the specific horrors of domestic violence, and while she gives this her very best, the material never reaches her lofty level. It’s frustrating to watch an actor of clear intelligence glumly navigate a character of deep stupidity, and Cregger’s thin attempt to explain her decision-making as based on the trauma of a toxic relationship is an on-paper construct rather than anything that makes sense for a real person.As Barbarian progresses, and as my interest diminished, it becomes clear that the secretive trailer is less artful withholding and more deliberate deception, because if more cards were laid out on the table, the majority would balk at the very silly game being played. The big secret here is that sadly it’s not very good.Barbarian is released in US cinemas on 9 September and in the UK on 28 October."
Love and Let Die by John Higgs review – Fab Four plus 007 doesn’t quite add up,This Bond versus the Beatles study works best as a series of lively historical nuggets rather than a fight for the nation’s cultural soul,0,"It is a curious fact that the Beatles’ debut single, Love Me Do, and the first James Bond film, Dr No, were both released on Friday 5 October 1962. No one could have predicted that we would still be thrilled by the band’s music six decades later, or that the film franchise would still be going strong. John Higgs, however, had the intriguing idea of exploring their creation, development and afterlives in parallel.Though he inevitably covers some well-trodden territory, much of the detail is poignant and entertaining. In the early days of Beatlemania, Ringo Starr’s house was surrounded by fans 24 hours a day. His mother, Elsie, politely offered them sandwiches – which they took away, uneaten, as souvenirs. A friend admitted it was “awkward, particularly as the toilet was still in the yard”. The rulers of the Soviet Union, anxious about the rise of western youth culture, made strenuous efforts to discredit the Beatles. One article depicted them as monkeys and called them “Dung Beatles”, while a propaganda film, reports Higgs, bizarrely “intercut unflattering photographs of [the band] together with images of the Ku Klux Klan, ecstatic pop fans dancing, burning crosses and images of rural poverty from the American south”.When American censors objected to the name of the character Pussy Galore in Goldfinger, they were reassured by pictures of the actor Honor Blackman at the UK premiere with Prince Philip. When the Australian model George Lazenby was auditioning for the part of Bond in the late 1960s, the producers sent sex workers to his hotel room to check that he wasn’t gay.Love and Let Die works well as a collection of sharp and pacy stories, though it is a pity Higgs has a weakness for grandiose flourishes. There were “truths in [the] screaming” of the girls at early Beatles concerts, he writes, “that many religions have yet to grasp”. He also offers us a bold overarching thesis, based on Freud’s idea of the conflict between Eros and Thanatos, that “while the Beatles represent love, James Bond represents death. What makes Bond different from other spies is that he has a licence to kill.”It is clearly true that Bond and Beatles embody different attitudes to class, privilege, violence, masculinity and Englishness. But Higgs wants to go much further and claim that they are engaged in a kind of permanent “struggle for the soul of [British] culture”.“When we cheer on Bond, and fantasise about living his life,” he argues, we “unconsciously find ourselves supporting the powers that be … The spell was massively weakened, however, by the arrival of the Beatles.” Once the Beatles had broken up, the Bond of the early 1970s “continued to insist that he and the British establishment were the best in the world. And now … there was nothing of equal stature to contradict him.”None of this is very plausible. There has been a vast amount of pushback against the politics and sexual politics of Bond’s world that has not needed to evoke the Beatles as a counterweight. And many people clearly enjoy the films for the suits, stunts, hedonism and exotic locations, and the “sophistication” of a hero who can’t resist telling bar staff how to make the best martini, without buying into their values. Higgs himself cites the interesting case of 007 (Shanty Town), a 1967 song by Desmond Dekker, the voice of the new post-independence Jamaica, which offered “a strange mix of topical political reportage and Bond fandom”. It is safe to assume that he had no time for what the book describes as “post-imperial fantasies of British exceptionalism”.It no doubt makes a kind of sense to say that “the Beatles represent love”, though love is hardly an unusual topic for songs, but what about Higgs’s notion that the Bond films are “about selling people death”? It is true that women tend to die after sleeping with 007, that some of the films feature terrifying stunts and that the producers have a knack for tapping into current fears, most recently about surveillance, hacking and nanotechnology. Yet much of the franchise treats violence and death in a cartoonish style far less visceral and disturbing than in the average TV cop show. Higgs himself mentions the scene in Diamonds Are Forever featuring “an almost uncountable number of police cars smashing into each other – often followed by a shot of their unharmed drivers exiting the cars and throwing their hats to the ground in frustration … people usually survive car accidents in the James Bond universe”.Higgs is a lively writer and has assembled many intriguing nuggets from six decades of British popular culture.

The Whale review – Darren Aronofsky’s latest is a contrived disappointment,It’s hard to feel much sympathy for Brendan Fraser’s morbidly obese English teacher in this much anticipated but underwhelming return to movies,2,"Darren Aronofsky’s vapid, hammy and stagey movie, adapted by Samuel D Hunter from his own 2012 play, is the festival’s biggest and most surprising disappointment: the writing clunks; the narrative is contrived and unconvincing and the whole film has a strange pass-agg body language, as if it is handling its own painful subject matter with kid gloves and asking us to do the same.Brendan Fraser is Charlie, an English teacher in charge of an online study course, run via Zoom. He claims to the group that his laptop camera isn’t working, which is why the square on the screen where his face should be is blank. But actually he doesn’t want them to see what he looks like: Charlie is morbidly obese, a giant pool of flesh, hardly able to leave the couch with a walking frame to get to the lavatory, gorging delivery pizzas and fried chicken, with a stash of chocolate bars in the desk drawer. Our first view of Charlie is of him masturbating to gay porn, culminating in a heart attack that almost kills him.But this isn’t supposed to be ironic black comedy and Charlie isn’t supposed to be greedy or lazy or selfish (although these uncaring talking points are not really aired). He is depressed after the death of his partner, a former student from an adult night-school class for whom he left his wife and young daughter; it was a desertion for which he is still guilt-stricken.Charlie’s only friend now is his late partner’s sister Liz (Hong Chau), a tough-minded nurse exasperated at his refusal to go to hospital. His fragile, lonely life becomes more complicated still with the arrival at his door of a strange young man, Thomas (Ty Simpkins), a Christian evangelist from the church of which Charlie’s partner was a member. His angry, conflicted daughter, Ellie (Sadie Sink), also appears to want to reconnect.Alongside it all, there is Charlie’s love of literature, especially Melville’s Moby-Dick, and Charlie is glumly aware that he is the whale, the huge bloated entity that no one wants to hunt down or obsess over or even think about at all. Or perhaps it is that Charlie is hunting the elusive meaning of his own wrecked life, deep in the ocean of loneliness.Fraser brings a definite gentleness and openness to the role of Charlie, and his performance is good, although of course it is upstaged by the showy latex and the special effects, which are there to elicit a mix of horror and sympathy and awards-season love, like a very serious male version of the “Fat Monica” prom video scene in Friends.There is a too-good-to-be-true sheen to Charlie’s sweet saintliness; his emotional yearning and wounded niceness are underlined by the coercive orchestral score, and this movie’s concept of death is sentimental and even sneakily religiose. But even this isn’t exactly the problem – it is the convoluted plot that surrounds Charlie: the weird and implausible shenanigans around Thomas’s background and Ellie’s unhappiness and bad attitude, all indirectly and clumsily revealed. Charlie believes in Ellie’s essential goodness to the very end, but any supposed ambiguity about her intentions and behaviour is unsatisfying and uninteresting. Fraser does an honest job in the role of Charlie, and Hong Chau brings a welcome fierceness and sinew to the drama, but this sucrose film is very underpowered. The Whale screened at the Venice film festival and is released on 3 February in UK cinemas."
The Ghost of Richard Harris review – a hushed reassessment of a hellraiser by his sons,"Venice film festival: There are some memorable moments in this documentary about the great Irish actor, but too many inconvenient truths are dismissed for it to be definitive",3,"Adrian Sibley’s documentary is a genial, if sometimes incurious film about the legendary Irish actor and singer, who began his screen career as a pressure-cooker of rage on the rugby field in Lindsay Anderson’s This Sporting Life and finally became the beatific face of snowy-haired wisdom as Dumbledore in the first two Harry Potter movies.This watchable film goes easy on Harris’s boozing and brawling: in fact, it takes an almost a counter-revolutionary approach to the whole subject. In recent years, talk of Ollie and Peter and Richard’s hell-raising has usually been countered with a frowning diagnosis of alcoholism, and this film simply quotes Harris’s own roistering dismissal of all that: (“I drank because I loved it!”) and pretty much leaves things there. Incredibly, Harris hired a press photographer to cover a week-long post-divorce European jaunt via private plane he took with his entourage, which took in many bars and brothels – to humiliate his ex-wife, it is alleged, although his high-jinks were covered with giggling hilarity in the papers. Harris’s cocaine habit is hardly mentioned: I suspect because it doesn’t fit in with the essentially sentimental narrative of booze.We go from Harris’s boyhood in a well-off home in Limerick in the Irish republic, his idyllic summers on Kilkee in County Clare, with a large family whose stern, disciplinarian dad was a powerful presence, and then to the Jesuit school where getting the strap was normal. He came to acting late, became a mature student at Lamda in London and, with remarkable entrepreneurial flair, rented a small theatre to mount his own production of Clifford Odets’ Winter Journey (The Country Girl); it led to a job with Joan Littlewood’s Theatre Workshop, West End stage roles and then a stellar movie career, with work in musical theatre, the long-running, long-touring Camelot stage show, and an amazing side-hustle in pop music.The most affecting parts of the film come with his three grownup sons gathering to remember him: actor Jared Harris, director Damian Harris, and actor Jamie Harris. They are still overawed by the colossal reputation which he had cultivated while far away from their growing-up (the boys had been placed at boarding schools). There is something very ghostly in Jared coming back to the sumptuous suite Harris kept at London’s Savoy hotel, where he spent his final days.So where did the rage come from, Jared wonders, the rage that lay behind so much of the excess? Sibley offers a very plausible explanation: when Harris was 19, his promising sporting career was ruined by a diagnosis of tuberculosis, which kept him in bed and which was also socially humiliating because TB was associated with the lower orders. It was in his sickbed that Harris discovered Shakespeare and the imaginative life – but maybe that surge of imagination fused with a surge of frustration and rage.And how about his emotional life and family life? What was it really like, day after day, week after week, month after month for his wife Elizabeth Rees-Williams who was stuck at home and the boys sadly away at boarding school, while Harris was away on location and on tour, enjoying himself? Sexual indiscretions were an important but undiscussed part of booze episodes, and post-booze amnesia was a convenient route to self-forgiveness. The film gallantly steers away from this. Leniency is the film’s mode of operation, but it wouldn’t work without it, and it’s a watchable study of a unique talent. The Ghost of Richard Harris screened at the Venice film festival."
Other People’s Children review – a heartfelt modern love triangle,"This sweet, sad drama sees a teacher keen to be a mother bonding with her new boyfriend’s daughter, while dealing with the constant presence of his ex",3,"Rebecca Zlotowski’s sweet, sad film is a drama of grownup sadnesses, lost chances and last chances; a little lenient and soft-focus, maybe, although I loved the bittersweet closing-credits shot of its star Virginie Efira breezing through the streets of Paris in a spirit of philosophical acceptance to the chanson Les Eaux de Mars on the soundtrack.Efira plays Rachel, a single woman in her late 30s who is a teacher, a demanding, rewarding job that she loves; she is thoroughly committed to her students and is at present trying to find a work-experience placement for a troubled kid that she believes in. Rachel is Jewish, and regularly attends a Paris synagogue with her sister and widower father – a synagogue protected by an armed soldier against antisemitic attacks. Rachel has had a chequered dating history; she is worried about her ticking biological clock and receives warnings from her elderly gynaecologist, a very funny and surreal acting cameo from the legendary documentary film-maker Frederick Wiseman.But Rachel is at the moment secretly very excited about someone she has met at the guitar lessons she’s taking: this is Ali (Roschdy Zem), a handsome divorced guy sharing custody of his five-year-old daughter called Leila with his ex-wife (who is played by Chiara Mastroianni). Ali and Rachel begin a passionate relationship – amusingly, those guitar lessons are never mentioned ever again. But it is complicated by her relationship with Leila whom she adores, but who clearly needs some time to get used to her. Rachel is aware that she may never be able to get pregnant, so if Ali is to be the One, she has got to persuade Leila to think of her as her new mum. Yet Ali’s ex-partner is always on the scene.Poor Rachel is aware that her relationship with Ali, however blissfully happy and fulfilled it appears to be, is always conditional. Ali could break up with her anytime he wants and take up with someone else, and maybe have more children. Rachel does not have that luxury, but can’t afford to put pressure on him for a commitment without risking exactly that breakup. So making Leila fall in love with her is what she has to do. And perhaps Ali will always favour Leila over her. It all has the makings of a very contemporary and painful love triangle.There are tears for both children and adults, although I felt that Zlotowski never quite dramatises the lives of Zem and Mastroianni’s characters; they are a little two-dimensional compared with Rachel. But it is a gentle, heartfelt relationship drama about – and for – intelligent adults. Other People’s Children screened at the Venice film festival and is released on 17 March in UK cinemas and on digital platforms."
Honk for Jesus. Save Your Soul. review – megachurch satire isn’t worth praise,Sterling K Brown and Regina Hall are left stranded in a disappointingly blunt and consistently unfunny attempt to ridicule religious hypocrisy,1,"Not every Black actor is called to play a church pastor on screen. But those who get the part, get the part. Arsenio Hall, a preacher’s kid, channeled his father while hamming it up as Reverend Brown in Coming to America. Courtney B Vance had flashbacks of his childhood churchgoing experience while portraying the conflicted Reverend Biggs in The Preacher’s Wife, and even took the extra step of getting baptized before shooting began. “When we were filming at the church and the choir was singing,” Vance told Jet magazine in 1996, “the Holy Spirit took over. This isn’t just a movie. It’s the Holy Spirit working.”Even actors in small-screen pastor roles rise to the occasion. All summer I’ve struggled to stop myself from rewinding this old JamIe Foxx Show clip of him as the flask-shooting Reverend Alizé, a character you have to believe sprang from formative experiences as a church band member in rural Texas. (“He coulda been cloudy as Kahlúa,” Alizé says while officiating the funeral of a man he’s desperately trying not to disparage, “but Jevus made him clear as vodka!”) For so many Americans the Black church is a rite of passage of joys, conflicts and contradictions – which is what makes preacher portrayals so magnetic, after all. They take you back. Hence why Black church is such an enduring screen trope and, increasingly, real life imitates art.Honk for Jesus. Save Your Soul. doesn’t resonate in the same way, however. The Jordan Peele-produced film was stretched from a 2018 short of the same name and the 90-minute version stars Sterling K Brown and Regina Hall as Lee-Curtis and Trinitie Childs – respectively, the pastor and first lady of a beleaguered Atlanta megachurch mired in scandal. Their once-robust flock of 25,000 has dwindled down to just five sad sacks. Most of the deserters have found a home with a husband and wife pastoring team who used to be part of Childs’s ministry, and is now poised to overtake it. Fold in a mockumentary-style POV, and it’s clear the film would have you take it for a comedy. So why are the laughs so few and far between?Well, for one thing, rookie feature writer-director Adamme Ebo fixates on the same joke – the inherent hypocrisy of institutional religion and prosperity hucksters like the Childses. On camera, they project piety. In the privacy of their Escalade, they rap along to filthy hip-hop music. In bed, they praise God – and mean it. But at no point do we get a sense of what made them such a Sunday draw before the scandal. Brown’s Lee-Curtis isn’t big on Pentecostal-style showmanship. There’s no call and response, no wild metaphors, no grunts or staccato speech runs. There’s just Lee-Curtis railing against homosexuality because, you know, he’s in the closet.Worse, Lee-Curtis has been grooming teenage boys and can’t even help coming on to a young sound guy in the documentary crew. It’s this compulsion that’s cost Lee-Curtis his flock and now has him working overtime to broker a bank-breaking settlement with his accusers so he can get back to the hustle.Not only is this setup not funny. It’s ripped from the headlines. A decade ago an Atlanta megachurch pastor called Eddie Long was sued by a handful of young men who accused him of using his position of power to coerce them into sexual relationships. The scandal didn’t lead to a great exodus among the church’s 25,000 members or otherwise hurt Long, who was also quite outspoken against homosexuality.But there’s no mystery as to why Long held on to his job in the pulpit until he died in 2017 at age 63 from what his church called “an aggressive form of cancer”. He was a spellbinding spectacle, and it takes a mega personality to fill the pews, close the book deals and keep TV money and donations streaming in. Brown certainly has the comedic and dramatic chops to go there. But he’s hamstrung by the film’s lackluster writing, sluggish pacing and fidgety point of view. Hall, a comedic tour de force who should’ve crushed the Trinitie role, is let down, too. Honk would have you believe her first lady is the true victim of this scandal, which takes way too long to play out. Trinitie is the one who carries her husband’s water on camera and in the community and is thoroughly humiliated in the final act. And yet it’s rival mega pastors Keon Sumpter (Conphidence) and wife Shakura (Nicole Beharie) who come off more winsome – mostly because they didn’t get more screen time to evolve their own duplicity.Ebo tries to garner sympathy for Trinitie, leaving her around boys her husband either had seduced or would have if he got the chance. But you never really get the sense their marriage was more than community theater. You don’t feel for them.Black church is all about feeling – the building, the people, the message. But Honk has none of that soul. At best, the film is an abstract commentary on a culture it doesn’t fully understand; at worst, it’s half-hearted creative license. And at this late stage, sadly, not even Jevus could save it.Honk for Jesus. Save Your Soul. is now in US cinemas and on Peacock with releases in the UK and Australia to be announced"
‘Did Will Smith hurt me? He played Ali!’ – Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle live,"M&S Bank Arena, LiverpoolThey are arguably the two greatest US standups of their generation – and both topical for not always lovely reasons. Could this double-whammy possibly live up to the hype?",3,"‘This is going to be one of the most legendary nights in comedy history!” raves the compere. But we’ll be the judges of that. You’ve got to pick through much myth-making to get to the meat of this rare Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle double whammy. But maybe the hype is justified. These are arguably the two greatest US standups of their generation, and both are hot-topical too, if not always for lovely reasons. Rock got walloped at the Oscars live on TV; Chappelle’s routines about trans people prompted a hundreds-strong staff walkout at Netflix. With background noise that loud, and the claims of their numerous hype men ringing in our ears, can the pair’s comedy possibly make itself heard?It can – particularly Rock’s, with the caveat that much of it is rehashed from his recent Ego Death tour. He’s stronger here than in that solo show, with some of the lesser, domestic material culled and a tighter focus on his antic comedy and often nuanced thinking about socio-politics. His race material runs provokingly counter to current pieties, as he considers Meghan Markle’s naivety and, in a routine fruitfully developed since the spring, the Kardashians “loving black people more than black people love themselves”. A riff on dating post-#MeToo culminates in a very effective sketch demonstrating that “all sex looks bad in court”.When addressing sex and gender, Rock’s outlook is not always the freshest. He admits as much here and makes an effort, I think, to soften the harder edges of his occasional chauvinism. Chappelle shares many of the older comic’s assumptions – women’s role is to spend men’s money, and be thankful – but makes no apology for it. Rock sees the funny side of male behaviour; Chappelle, the alpha ne plus alpha, celebrates and even solemnises it. See a closing routine in which, all joking apart, he holds up the Rock v Will Smith fracas as an emblem of maleness: “This is what men do.”That’s Chappelle for you: no comic is so skilled at hanging you from their every word, none can switch so seamlessly from preaching to comedy then back again. But the charisma isn’t always backed up by strong material in this set bookended by visits the 49-year-old made to ex-boxer Floyd Mayweather’s Las Vegas “titty bar”. A story about a brush he once had with Russian mobsters is all skilled raconteurship and minimal content. A lot of the set draws its charge from Chappelle’s unsentimental honesty about his masculinity – the trips to strip clubs, the cheating on his wife, the beating meted out to the man who recently assaulted Chappelle on stage in LA. He knows you’re not supposed to take pride in this behaviour – but there are laughs to be had, if not the most savoury, in the knowing and the doing it anyway.During a show that emphasises the affinities between the two acts by placing them side-by-side, both men address this experience of recently being attacked – their least likely affinity of all. Rock has fresh material on Will Smith (“Did that shit hurt? This motherfucker played Ali!”); Chappelle speaks about how his own assault was hijacked by Rock himself, leaping out of the crowd. Between Rock’s high-octane cultural commentary and Chappelle’s smooth account, there are reminders in this two-hander, albeit sporadic, of how good these comics can be when left to speak unmolested.

House of Hammer review – the dark truth about Armie Hammer’s downfall,This documentary investigates the sexual misconduct allegations against the Hollywood star – then delves into his family who are said to be ‘a million times’ worse than Succession,4,"“I tried watching Succession,” says Armie Hammer’s aunt Casey, somewhere near the halfway point of House of Hammer (Discovery+). “I had to turn it off … Magnify Succession a million times and it was literally my family.” This, it turns out, is not hyperbole.The career of Armie Hammer, star of The Social Network and Call Me By Your Name, ended virtually overnight last year, when the internet lit up with rumours (all of which he denies) of emotional and physical abuse. A direct accusation of rape followed, for which Hammer was investigated but not charged. Three-part documentary series House of Hammer recaps this sorry story then goes further, showing the disgraced actor to be the product of extraordinarily toxic privilege, and pitching his downfall as a battle for the ages: the corrosive influence of old money versus the untameable power of new media.The first episode’s key interviewee is Dallas entrepreneur Courtney Vucekovich, who says she connected with Hammer via Instagram in late 2019. She claims that when they finally arranged to meet in the summer of 2020, their interactions were disturbing from the start. According to her, Hammer left a note reading “I am going to bite the FUCK out of you”, after turning up at her apartment to find her out of town. “I chose to look at it as more flattering than concerning,” Vucekovich recalls. Their first sexual encounter left her traumatised, she says, so she distanced herself from Hammer. But, we hear her claim that he tracked her phone’s location and turned up unbidden to beg forgiveness: “I thought it was romantic. I thought, ‘He’s fighting for me.’” Further meetings, Vucekovich says, left her with visible handprints and deep bite marks on her body, which she claims she was encouraged to wear like trophies. “I was interpreting that as love. Looking at it now makes me sick.”Vucekovich’s story seems absurdly naive in the retelling, but that’s her point. Her account appears courageous and valuable because it demonstrates how, if true, anyone could be vulnerable to coercion and abuse. She is a smart, articulate, successful woman who says she nevertheless ignored what she now believes to have been the reddest of flags.In January 2021 another woman, known as Effie, went public, sharing what she claimed were screenshots of messages from Hammer revealing his sinister, controlling behaviour and a cannibalism fetish. Vucekovich says she recognised the pattern, and the documentary also talks to two further women who claim to have had similar experiences.With Hammer comprehensively cancelled – his agent and publicist dropped him and movie roles evaporated – something odd and very modern happened, powered by social media’s propensity for hive-mind sleuthing. A TikTok user went viral simply by finding a copy of Casey Hammer’s self-published 2015 memoir Surviving My Birthright and summarising, chapter by chapter, its account of abuse and excess in the Hammer family, and its suggestions that the rot had been festering for generations.House of Hammer expands on this book, with Casey as a consultant and the main interviewee of episode two. The dynasty is traced back to Armand Hammer, Armie’s great-grandfather who, as the main stakeholder in Occidental Petroleum, was quietly one of the 20th century’s most powerful men. We hear how his huge wealth and lack of qualms about bribery and blackmail enabled him to do whatever he wanted.Armand bantered with Brezhnev and hobnobbed with Reagan; he was convicted of illegally donating to Richard Nixon’s Watergate fund, but later pardoned by George HW Bush. These big names are thrilling but for British viewers there’s a sudden chill of recognition when Prince Charles and Lady Di appear. A sticky tale plays out about large charitable donations, glittering galas and the PR drive that meant Occidental largely got away with the 1988 Piper Alpha disaster, which happened on one of its rigs in the North Sea.Armand Hammer was a man for whom money bought impunity. His life story, combined with that of his unwanted, bitter son Julian, who ran his LA home like a less avuncular Hugh Hefner (and whose own son, Michael – Armie’s dad – would grow up determined to destroy him, according to Casey) suggests Armie Hammer’s background as one where extreme privilege was both the cause of and, in reputational terms, the solution to some horrific conduct. Logan Roy et al have nothing on them."
"Bardo, False Chronicle of a Handful of Truths review – Iñárritu’s outrageously narcissistic existential crisis",A film-maker returns home to Mexico to face his memories in a spectacular and staggeringly self-indulgent surreal epic,3,"Alejandro G Iñárritu, Oscar-winning creator of such movies as Amores Perros, Birdman and The Revenant has now returned to his Mexican homeland for this quasi-autobiographical epic, sprawling across a personal magic-realist dreamscape where fact and fiction shapeshift into each other in ways which are technically stylish and massively insufferable.It’s a quite staggeringly self-indulgent and self-congratulatory film – somewhere on a continuum between Fellini and Malick – about a Mexican journalist and documentary film-maker who has been lavishly rewarded in the US and is now receiving a big prize, usually given only to Americans. (Iñárritu has, I suspect, a slightly sketchy idea about the working lives of actual journalist-slash-documentary film-makers, as opposed to those of colossally important Oscar-winning feature directors.) But now, at this moment of triumph, our hero finds himself in a midlife crisis of identity, plunged into a rabbit hole of memories and hallucinatory anxieties about his family, his career and Mexico itself.The elegant veteran performer Daniel Gimenéz Cacho plays Silverio, the award-winning film-maker whom we see first in LA (a surreal and poignant scenario to which we will finally return) and then in his Mexican home town where he is trying to secure an interview with the US president – an interview the US ambassador is offering to set up on condition that Silverio abandons his criticism of the White House’s anti-Mexican racism. In fact, we hear a bizarre news story about an attempt by Amazon to buy outright the Mexican state of Baja California as a vast fulfilment centre – a pert piece of satire that alerts us to the fact that this film is produced by Netflix and not Amazon.Silverio is loved and admired by close friends and family but his journalistic contemporaries have something else in their hearts, revealed in the gigantic party thrown for him by his media comrades in Mexico City – a kind of awestruck envy combined with resentment in the way he has left them behind, commodifying Mexican poverty and wretchedness for the gringos in his films about the experiences of immigrants and the drug business. A certain rancorous ex-colleague, who now hosts a top-rated but horribly crass TV show, tries to get him on for an interview but Silverio fears he will be ambushed with questions about his vulnerable childhood and racist cracks about his indigenous background.He is particularly resented for his hugely successful docufictional epic about Mexico, entitled A False Chronicle of a Handful of Truths, which playfully imagines what the conquistador Hernán Cortés was thinking and feeling in a brutal yet whimsically imagined scenario of conquest – a scenario Iñárritu later duly re-inserts into Silverio’s story, which has the effect of semi-seriously making Silverio and Cortés of equal importance in this New Mexico myth.The film is speckled with brilliant individual moments: there is a stunning sequence in which the streets are littered with the inert bodies of Mexico’s “missing”: the vanished people claimed by poverty and crime, heartlessly ignored by the state. And there is a bravura scene in which Silverio comes face-to-face with the ghost of his poor old dad and tries to say all the things to him he should have said while he was still alive.There a shrewdly depicted scene in which Silverio, for all his activism, takes his family to a super-rich vacation resort where servants are not allowed on the beach – and another when Silverio demands the US Immigration official at LAX apologise for saying that as a Mexican national with an O-1 visa he is not entitled to call America “home”. That last one is where the movie seems most intensely autobiographical (but maybe Iñárritu and co-writer Nicolás Giacobone imagined the whole thing).It is made with real panache – so much so that you can forgive much of the film’s outrageous narcissism. Iñárritu could, if he chose, tell us an equally painful but less grandiose and auto-mythic story about his own life – but he has exercised his prerogative as an artist and given us this confection instead. It is certainly spectacular.Bardo, False Chronicle of a Handful of Truths screened at the Venice film festival; it is released on 18 November in cinemas and on 16 December on Netflix."
Dry Ground Burning review – engrossing portrait of all-female gang in Brasilia favela,A cast of swaggering non-actors blur the line between reality and fiction in this electrifying Brazilian tale of rebellion ,4,"Here is an astonishing work of survival and resilience from Joana Pimenta and Adirley Queirós; their docufiction film packs a pulpy punch, yet is also rooted in an urgent political reality. Informed by the 2018 Brazilian general election, this combustible portrait of life on the margins is an engrossing, volatile ride through Sol Nascente, a crime-ridden slum on the outskirts of Brasília.Sharing their names with their characters, nonprofessional locals Chitara and Léa are cast as swaggering half-sisters who watch over a formidable all-female gang. The women steal oil from an underground pipeline and sell the black gold to a motorcycle squad; they create a fortress of their own, rebelling against the disenfranchisement that breeds under the authoritarian government. While their nocturnal escapades offer the visceral thrills of a gangster film, real life is also intimately woven into the narrative. Like her character, Léa is also freshly out of prison, the threat of incarceration still haunting her every footstep.Working with non-actors is a delicate process, and what makes Dry Ground Burning especially absorbing is its willingness to allow fictional storylines to organically emanate from Chitara and Léa’s lived experiences. The film feels like a collaborative effort, and its sense of collectivism is echoed in the invigorating sequences where people sing and dance together. The queer dimension of the bond between the women in Sol Nascente offers another avenue of liberation.In the end, reality does tragically step in, taking the fictional elements in an unexpected direction, but the possibility for catharsis remains. In a world marred by political hopelessness, Dry Ground Burning literally and figuratively sets the landscape on fire, and out of the ashes there is hope for a new order free from oppression. Dry Ground Burning is released on 2 September at the ICA, London."
Her Way review – a sex-worker mum puts her life on the line,Call My Agent!’s Laure Calamy excels as a Strasbourg sex worker forced outside her safety zone to rescue her wayward son,4,"A sex worker, and proud of it, Marie (Call My Agent!’s Laure Calamy, excellent) has a support system of colleagues on the streets of Strasbourg, and a set of rules that keep her safe, in this impressive drama directed by Cécile Ducrocq. But when her sullen, adolescent son crashes out of catering college and into a downward spiral, Marie must break her own working code in order to buy the boy a last chance to make his way in life. She takes a risky job in a brothel across the border in Germany; meanwhile, mother-son relations become increasingly fractious. In cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema"
Mr Malcolm’s List review – costumes steal the show in Regency romp,A jilted beauty plots her revenge in this perky but predictable period drama,3,"The Bridgerton effect is prominently on show in this Jane Austen cosplay, which brings colour-blind casting to an otherwise formulaic 19th-century society romance. Noted beauty Julia (Zawe Ashton, a satisfying, spiky mix of feathers, lace and malice) is furious when she is rejected by wealthy bachelor Mr Malcolm (Ṣọpẹ́ Dìrísù) for failing to match his list of requirements for a bride. She engineers a plot, with her reluctant best friend Selina (Freida Pinto) as bait, to put the arrogant Mr Malcolm in his place.It’s pleasant, frothy, unapologetically by-numbers stuff. Suzanne Allain’s screenplay, adapted from her own novel, will hold no surprises to anyone with even the vaguest familiarity with the genteel intrigues of Austen’s world. Emma Holly Jones’s perky direction keeps the plot trotting briskly along, but the standout element is Pam Downe’s playful costumes."
Official Competition review – Penélope Cruz is a deadpan dream in wicked film-world satire,Two actors vie for the attention of their autocratic director in this hilarious Spanish-language skewering of the movie-making business,4,"There’s a certain kind of film about film-making that fully buys into the magic and mystery; that devours the dream factory narrative and delivers a warm embrace of a movie, channelling a message about the transformative power of cinema. Michel Hazanavicius’s The Artist is one example; so, in its lo-fi way, is Son of Rambow. And Singin’ in the Rain, for all the sprinkling of behind-the-camera cynicism, is a classic of the kind. Official Competition is none of these. Rather than a love letter to the cinematic arts, this very funny Spanish-language satire, starring Penélope Cruz and Antonio Banderas, is more of a poison pen jab to the jugular. It dismantles the lofty ambitions of cinema as great, important and significant, a monument on the cultural landscape. Instead, it shows us art for ego’s sake, and it has a lot of wickedly spiteful fun doing so.The film opens with a slow-panning shot across the 80th birthday present haul of pharmaceuticals billionaire Don Humberto (José Luis Gómez). A lifesize ceramic collie, a painting of a sad clown, a gun, a massage chair: Humberto surveys it all with displeasure, his waxily well-preserved face creasing into a frown. “How do they see me?” he demands of the craven assistant dancing attendance a cautiously respectful distance away (the extravagant shifts in focus between the two during this exchange emphasise just how far removed Humberto is from the rest of the world). The billionaire decides that he needs to reframe his legacy. And how better to launder a tainted reputation than by bankrolling a piece of great cinema?To this end, a hot literary novel is bought (Humberto is more impressed by the massive price tag attached to the rights than he is by the content of a book he never actually bothers to read) and a team of top talent is assembled. Lola Cuevas (Cruz) is the Cannes Palme d’Or-winning director with an electrical storm of red curls and a highly unconventional way of working. Two stars are cast in the lead roles of brothers who are violently at odds but bound together by blood. Félix Rivero (Banderas) is a global superstar, draped in the trappings of celebrity and success. Iván Torres (Oscar Martínez) is a luminary of the theatre who prizes the craft above all else. Both, in their own way, are great actors. Both take an immediate and visceral dislike to each other.The Argentinian directing duo Gastón Duprat and Mariano Cohn (who co-wrote the screenplay of Official Competition with Andrés Duprat) have a fascination with battling male egos: previous films include The Man Next Door (2009), a story of the spiralling conflict between two Buenos Aires neighbours triggered by a disagreement over a party wall. Territory is at stake here too, as Félix and Iván jostle for Lola’s approval during the increasingly wacky rehearsal process that makes up the main body of the film. Duprat and Cohn fill the set – the headquarters of Humberto’s empire, a grand but soulless modernist temple to wealth – with mirrors, the better for these preening, self-regarding egotists to admire themselves.But for all the considerable, if at times slightly overstretched entertainment value of watching Félix and Iván trade petty micro-aggressions and status flexes, it is Cruz, fiercely deadpan and utterly bonkers, who steals the film. Autocratic, exacting and strung as tightly as a banjo, Lola suspends boulders over her actors to fine-tune the authenticity of their emotional response, and uses an industrial metal grinder for an exercise in “ego”.With its blend of scabrous honesty and self-skewering silliness, this may be the most perceptive film about the movie-making business since Tom DiCillo’s Living in Oblivion.In cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema"
My Old School review – deft documentary on a notorious schoolboy imposter,"Animation, interviews and a lip-syncing Alan Cumming tell the true tale of a grown man who passed himself off as a pupil at a Glasgow high school",4,"One of those improbable tales that seem almost too weird to be true, the story of Brandon Lee, the unusually mature 16-year-old student transferred to Bearsden Academy in Glasgow in 1993, holds an enduring fascination for his fellow students. One of them is Jono McLeod, the director of this mischievous exploration of the now infamous case of a thirtysomething con artist who passed himself off as a kid.It’s a limber piece of film-making that blends animation (there’s a hint of the distinctive style of Beavis and Butt-Head in the crude figures and graphic simplicity), documentary interviews and dramatisation, this courtesy of Alan Cumming. The actual “Brandon Lee” agreed to be interviewed but refused to allow his face to be shown. Instead, Cumming lip-syncs his words and delivers an intuitive parallel performance, in a technique similar to that of Clio Barnard’s The Arbor. It’s a fascinating story that starts as an affable, strange-but-true tall tale but ends in a decidedly minor key."
The Feast review – bracingly gory Welsh-language feature debut,A wealthy family’s dinner party in the Welsh mountains takes a turn for the more or less expected in Lee Haven Jones’s slow-build horror,3,"There’s something evil lurking deep within the bedrock, just waiting to be unleashed. This “cursed earth” theme is a central idea in numerous creepy movies, but one that has gained traction with the rise of folk horror: it’s central to the wigged-out witchery of Ben Wheatley’s In the Earth, and to the pastoral menace of a host of new Irish horror pictures. But with his bracingly gory Welsh-language feature debut, Lee Haven Jones presents another angle. Sure, there is something uncommonly unpleasant that rests beneath “the Rise”, the wild land that the superstitious local farmers refuse to cultivate. But the real monsters, arguably, are the affluent family whose opulent modernist new-build is the film’s location, and the smirking, ferret-faced business adviser who has helped them pillage the land for short-term gain.The Feast requires a degree of commitment; it avoids jump scares in favour of a long, slow build of tension – so slow that at times the characters appear to be in the grip of a kind of paralysis – that pays off with an explosively grisly final act. Glenda (Nia Roberts) and her local MP husband, Gwyn (Julian Lewis Jones), are hosting a dinner party. The guests include the couple’s two dysfunctional sons and a neighbouring farmer’s wife. First to arrive, however, is the hired help. Cadi (Annes Elwy) is wild-eyed and traumatised, with sodden hair and a tendency to tread mud across the pristine poured concrete floor. The family might be too self-absorbed to spot the writing on the wall, but the emphatic plotting and pointed shots of axes leave few surprises for the audience."
The Twilight World by Werner Herzog review – Japanese officer’s infinity war,The German film-maker’s partly fictionalised account of an imperial army soldier who refused to surrender until 1974 frustratingly fails to get inside its fascinating subject’s head,0,"We’ve all heard about the Japanese soldier who, after the second world war ended, stayed on the Philippine jungle island where he was stationed, armed and lethal, dismissing all signs that Japan had been defeated as enemy propaganda. His name was Hiroo Onoda; he finally stood down in 1974 after almost 30 years of delusional guerrilla warfare and died in 2014. Werner Herzog, the prolific German film-maker who narrates his documentaries in a Wagnerian register (wonderfully parodied in the YouTube video Werner Herzog Reads Where’s Waldo?), contrived to meet Onoda in 1997 and has now written a very short, only partially satisfying book about him. The Twilight World is best described as a nonfiction account of Onoda’s long, pointless mission that phases in and out of fiction – or vice versa.So why didn’t Herzog do the obvious thing and make a film about Onoda instead? Perhaps because another film-maker got there first: Arthur Harari, whose impressive feature Onoda: 10,000 Nights in the Jungle has recently been released. Stretches of The Twilight World read like a screenplay or documentary outline that’s been injected with prose fiction growth hormones. In the expository and digressive passages, it’s impossible not to hear Herzog’s famous voice ringing charismatically in the inner ear (just as that of Quentin Tarantino resounded unmistakably in his recent novelisation Once Upon a Time in Hollywood). If a less celebrated figure than Herzog presented their editor with a book this slight, they’d probably be sent back to their desk to imagine their way deeper into the psychic jungle, fleshing it out with a few more chapters. Which is to say: we’re here for the writer as much as for the story.This isn’t Herzog’s first book — he is the author, most notably, of the 1978 travel diary Of Walking in Ice  – but they’re rare enough to invite the question we always ask when a lauded artist switches lanes: will he make a tit of himself? The start is shaky – if they ever award a prize for ropiest opening lines, my money is on Herzog (and his translator Michael Hofmann): “The night coils in fever dreams. No sooner awake than with an awful shudder, the landscape reveals itself as a durable daytime version of the same nightmare, crackling and flickering like loosely connected neon tubes.” Happily, this hallucinatory nonsense is a false alarm: the prose soon settles into a less hysterical descriptiveness, with only the odd surreal apocalyptic flourish. The author wisely trusts in the story he’s telling – and with one this good, he can well afford to move out of the way.In 1944, young intelligence officer Onoda is sent by his superior Major Taniguchi to Lubang Island with orders to destroy an airstrip, undermine the enemy American forces with guerrilla attacks and await the triumphant return of the imperial army – a mission he will cleave to for three decades with dizzying literal-mindedness. Taniguchi tells Onoda: “Your base of operations will be the jungle. Your campaign will be one of attrition. Skirmishes, ambushes, unpredictable attacks. You will be like a ghost, elusive, a continuing nightmare to the enemy. Your war will be without glory.” With three men at his command – the last of whom will be killed in the jungle in 1972, two years before Onoda surrenders – the soldier first engages the US forces in combat and then, after they leave, commences his absurd, prolonged resistance to a vanished adversary.In Herzog’s account, Onoda’s war assumes the glitchy, totalising paranoia of a Philip K Dick novel. With elegantly insane anti-logic, he interprets all evidence that the war is over as proof of the contrary. Newspapers, leaflets dropped over the jungle from aircraft, radio broadcasts and even pornography are deemed intricate forgeries designed to trick him into surrendering. Characteristically, Herzog envisions Onoda as a kind of existential hero – his mission obscure, his trials unknown, his enemy vast and metaphysical. Existence and combat are one: “Every human being on this island is my enemy.” Onoda is also, of course, a bizarre excrescence of imperial Japan, whose pressure-cooker code of duty, honour and sacrifice he takes to self-negating extremes.In its brevity, The Twilight World is sometimes as superficial as a Wikipedia entry – whole decades are skimmed over in a line or two – and at times frustratingly withholding. Herzog informs us that “the matter of those he had killed among the population never quite went away”, but no deeper investigation or reimagining follows. A bit of Googling reveals that Onoda and his comrades may have murdered as many as 30 people during his three decades as a rogue commando – which would make him one of the 20th century’s weirdest serial killers. The Twilight World provokes – and thwarts – an appetite to know more. Nearing his 80th birthday, Herzog gives off the megalomaniacal vibe of one who won’t let old age slow him down, perhaps won’t even notice that it’s happening. I hope he follows up this book with a probing, feverish and apocalyptic documentary: Hiroo Onoda – Human War.The Twilight World by Werner Herzog (translated by Michael Hofmann) is published by Bodley Head (£14.99).

Anaïs in Love review – Anaïs Demoustier intoxicates in comic French love triangle,"Cinema’s latest irresistible chaotic femme, Demoustier is perfectly cast in first-time writer-director Charline Bourgeois-Tacquet’s sparkling romance",4,"She’s a familiar character. Skittish, self-absorbed, seductive and terminally unreliable, Anaïs (Anaïs Demoustier) is the latest incarnation of the chaotic femme, the slightly more world-weary European spin on the “manic pixie dreamgirl” trope that is a fixture in the American indie movie circuit.Loosely inspired by the gamine free spirits of the French New Wave, the chaotic femme tends to be in her late 20s or early 30s and at an impasse in all aspects of her life, with a tendency to sabotage the elements that threaten to succeed. She spends an inordinate amount of time running: the chaotic femme is always late, has great legs and favours short skirts, all the better to flit through various photogenic European city backdrops. Like her predecessors – Julie in Joachim Trier’s The Worst Person in the World and Paula in Léonor Serraille’s Jeune Femme, Anaïs ought to be insufferable. She’s feckless, enragingly disorganised and has the attention span of a three-year-old in the throes of a sugar rush. She’s part glitterball, part wrecking ball. In real life you would avoid her like a norovirus omelette. But filtered through the forgiving lens of first-time writer and director Charline Bourgeois-Tacquet’s peppy comic love triangle, she becomes a fascinating, intoxicating presence.The key to bringing magnetism to a superficially annoying character is, as always, in the casting. Just as Renate Reinsve flooded Julie in The Worst Person in the World with an itching, restless intelligence that explains her fickle lack of focus, so Demoustier works a similar alchemy with Anaïs. Often cast in intense, passionate roles – she was fiercely serious opposite a more flamboyant Romain Duris in François Ozon’s The New Girlfriend; intellectually agile in Alice and the Mayor – here Demoustier gets to show a more playful side. Anaïs is an incorrigible flirt. She seduces in order to reject, and is comfortably certain that all her (many) failures and transgressions will be forgiven thanks to her considerable charm. And in this she is correct. She is utterly beguiling. There’s a pivotal scene in which Anaïs, in the audience at a literary event, catches the eye of the speaker. And Demoustier so supercharges her performance with charisma, she almost seems to sparkle.It’s a performance that works in tandem with the film-making to give depth to the woman we see on screen. We are introduced to Anaïs – running, of course – to the accompaniment of a scurrying, tumbling piano score, like panic-induced palpitations in musical form. Her full-tilt movements are shadowed by a camera that seems to be as easily distracted as she is. It picks up on the essential details, however – the way that, having finally dumped her half-on, half-off boyfriend and embarked on an affair with Daniel (Denis Podalydès), an older man, her eyes slide away from his hungry gaze, as though she is already casing out an escape route.But while her relationship with Daniel is over almost before it starts, Anaïs is increasingly fascinated by his author partner, Emilie (Valeria Bruni Tedeschi, delivering her trademark breathy, slightly dishevelled sexy/neurotic shtick), connecting at first with her writing and then through a chance encounter on the street. Impulsive and instinctive as always, Anaïs drops everything, including her dissertation, a job and her cancer-stricken mother, to place herself in Emilie’s orbit.The reward is a sensual brushing of hand against thigh on a beach, a chime of synchronicity on the dancefloor and a cloud-parting moment of realisation. There’s a reason why all of her relationships have failed until now. Why she unceremoniously turfs her men from her bed after sex. The film’s arc might not leave Anaïs as a better person exactly – the apparent disregard for her mother’s deteriorating health suggests that empathy is markedly absent from the emotional baggage she hauls – but she does end the picture closer to taking control of her destiny rather than constantly trying to outrun it."
Orphan: First Kill review – horror prequel is parasitical in all the wrong ways,"Demonstrating how difficult it is to make a 25-year-old look as if they are still aged nine, this can’t compete with its 2009 forebear",2,"The 2009 horror film Orphan relied on a truly daft dramatic conceit, one that depended entirely on the appearance and eerie maturity of then 12-year-old Isabelle Fuhrman as the parentless child of the title, named Esther for much of the film. But Fuhrman’s uncanny performance, supported by similarly beyond-call-of-duty turns from Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard and adept genre management from director Jaume Collet-Serra, somehow turned a mixed bag into a bizarrely elegant reticule of some distinction.This prequel, once again starring Fuhrman as Esther, isn’t nearly as classy or clever, although it has its own wackadoodle twist, two-thirds in. Even more problematic, if you saw the first film, is that Fuhrman is now over a decade older, which makes trying to pass her off as a nine-year-old even harder, although a certain amount of VFX jiggery-pokery and the use of stunt doubles for some shots has been done to adjust proportions. But if any digital work went into de-ageing the actor’s face, it wasn’t enough: nasolabial folds and periorbital regions don’t lie. This makes a nonsense of the plot, which kicks off when the littlest sociopath reinvents herself to get scooped up by Julia Stiles and Rossif Sutherland as an American upper-middle class couple who believe she is their lost child. While the twist accounts for some of the gullibility in the adult world, it’s a long stretch.The most disappointing thing about the film is that it has none of the spark or originality of the first one and just parasitically drains its source material, incorporating details like the creepy black-light drawings and the borderline paedophilic subtext without adding anything substantial. Even the bland attempt to reprise the voyeuristic sex scene from the original film – a truly erotic moment with Farmiga and Sarsgaard humping against a kitchen island – is a poor substitute. Fans deserve better servicing than this. Orphan: First Kill is released on 19 August in cinemas."
Camping Trip review – pandemic lakeside R&R becomes operatic bloodbath,An impressively shot slo-mo brawl scene fails to elevate an illogical Covid-era campout that sees actors and directors overcompensating for a weak script,2,"This is the cinematic equivalent of the stopped clock telling the right time twice a day: a film full of stylistic overkill suddenly runs into the material that justifies it. Near the end of this otherwise unconvincing lakeside thriller from Canada’s Fuica brothers, there’s suddenly a protracted murderous brawl shot in an ecstatic ultra slo-mo sequence. It dazzles not just on its own terms, but for briefly elevating the film into something innovative, rather than the redundant showboating that’s gone before.Maybe the Fuicas had too much time on their hands. Camping Trip is the fruit of Covid-19 lockdown, and hinges on a tenuous pandemic tie-in. Pent-up party people Ace (Alex Gravenstein) and Coco (Hannah Forest Briand) hook up with besties Enzo (co-director Leonardo Fuica) and Polly (Caitlin Cameron) for some forest-bathing R&R beside a secluded lake. But they stumble on the corpse of a doctor involved in some kind of shady tradeoff, who has dumped a bag of money in their tent; if that wasn’t nice enough, he’s left a patent for a prototype vaccine in there, too. The prospect of instant riches divides the party, with skint Ace keen on scarpering with the proceeds. It’s not a great time for Orick (Michael D’Amico) and Billy (Jonathan Vanderzon), the little’n’large roughnecks who offed the doctor, to turn up at the fireside.There’s not much logic or depth to any of this. Characterisation is puddle-deep, with Ace’s serial dick-flashing predominating. It’s not every day you see protagonists having a bisexual foursome, something that goes weirdly unexplored in the later tensions. Everyone behaves idiotically, prompted by story needs: the first squabble over the loot is quickly forgotten, so they can have an impromptu dance party to draw in the criminals. The actors overcompensate for the weak script with postural, shrill performances. The directors overcompensate, never throwing in one drone shot when three or four will do.Which makes the sudden lurch into an operatic bloodbath, shot with considerable psychological acuity, all the more impressive. Shortly afterwards, there is a second confrontation that’s almost as eye-catchingly lensed, the camera swivelling ceaselessly to reveal and then hide the carnage, a bit like Jack Nicholson’s death scene in The Passenger. The Fuicas don’t hone the choreography as finely this time, but clearly there is some visual talent there. So it’s a shame they bandy it around indiscriminately, like noisy city folk in the sticks. Camping Trip is available on digital platforms on 16 August."
War and Peace review – sprawling film essay on horror images of war,"From restored early 20th-century footage to the current unrest in Syria, a probing reassessment of the supposed neutrality of the camera",3,"Since its invention, cinema has played a crucial role in how images of war are created and immortalised in the popular imagination. Divided into four chapters, Massimo D’Anolfi and Martina Parenti’s sprawling documentary throws the supposed neutrality of the camera up in the air, probing how photography is more than a witness; it can also be an integral cog in the war machine.Restored by film archivists from the ravages of time, flickering, scratchy footage of the Italian-Turkish war of 1911-12 jumpstarts this cinematic odyssey; it also alights at the Crisis Unit of the Italian ministry of foreign affairs and ECPAD, the audiovisual wing of the French ministry of defence. From a 1911 public hanging of Turkish men in Trieste to the current unrest in Syria, the horrors of war are front and centre, yet organisations such as the Crisis Unit or ECPAD are where images get dissected with critical distance. Training classes at ECPAD, for example, involve analysing photographs for their informational value, instilling in the soldiers the importance of creating audiovisual materials with military interests in mind.In covering such a wide range of topics, however, the film seems to lose sight of what it is trying to accomplish towards the end. The fourth chapter returns to the refrigerated vaults of film archives, stressing the value of preservation work. Yet this section also includes various clips of wartime brutality with no context. Since the previous chapters go to great length to establish the ideology that lies behind the production of such images, this careless insertion of footage tends to defeat the film’s own purpose. In focusing on how audiovisual materials are scrutinised elsewhere, War and Peace neglects to interrogate its own relationship to the images of war. War and Peace is available on 18 August on True Story."
Special Delivery review – noirish bruiser is Fast and Furious in South Korea,Parasite’s Park So-dam stars as an elite courier ferrying fugitives in an action thriller packed with dangerous driving,3,"This barrelling action thriller has been billed as a Korean Fast and Furious, but takes a swift handbrake turn into something considerably darker and more introspective. Parasite’s Park So-dam stars as Eun-ha, a Busan junkyard worker who moonlights as an elite courier, ferrying fugitives. Calmly sipping a slushie as she slams her BMW through the streets, bantering with her Hawaiian-shirted boss, she is coasting through this petrolhead playground, until her latest job comes in.Eun-ha is tasked with going to Seoul to run a disgraced baseball player involved in a gambling scam down to the docks where he can flee abroad. But there’s a snag: he is caught by Jo (Song Sae-byeok, channelling Gary Oldman’s linen-suited mania from Leon), a corrupt police officer running the racket, so she only manages to pick up his son Seo-won (Jung Hyun-jun). The kid is carrying the security fob needed to access an account holding millions, and Eun-ha finds herself thrust into the role of reluctant parent with the capital’s bent cops on her trail.It’s a labyrinthine setup for an action film, one that blooms almost noirishly as the chase unfolds and Seo-won’s vulnerability triggers dormant compassion in Eun-ha. As we learn when Jo brings on board a special investigator, she is a North Korean defector (who, in South Korean films, often seem to have almost superhuman capabilities). Against her best judgment, she starts to surrender to the feelings of estrangement and abandonment awakened by the boy. In essence, it’s the same “family” message as Fast and Furious – but it’s a hard-won realisation here, not a contractually obliged refrain.Sometimes the joins show on the bodywork where director Park Dae-min, in his third feature, solders this traumatic material to the cocky popcorn-flick register. If there’s a similar ad hoc quality to some of the plotting, this pragmatism serves the action sequences well. Not just packed with slick driving, they are driven by a furious improvisation, too, from jamming legs in car doors to Jo stapling his wounds shut. Like Drive My Car’s chauffeur gone rogue, Park So-dam is an interestingly sullen, uningratiating heroine, and this bruiser of a film reminds us that even middling Korean genre fare is a cut above. Special Delivery is available on digital platforms on 22 August."
A Song for Us review – folk-singing love story can’t avoid hippy nonsense,"Fine performances by the female leads aren’t enough to rescue this amateurish, low-budget film that hits all the wrong notes",2,"This low-budget Canadian feature has its heart in the right place with a gentle story about folk-singing hippy lovers who part and then find each other again years later. Alas, the production values suggest the crew must have been either interns or working for beer and craft table leftovers. Maybe it’s the jarring disconnect between the TV soap-quality of the digital cinematography and the late 1960s setting – the latter just looks wrong on this kind of stock. The disjunction is made even worse by the addition of black-and-white archive footage from the time, showing long-haired youngsters hanging out in Yorkville, then an unincorporated village outside Toronto and home to folk clubs and American draft dodgers. Either way, it feels amateurish, although Lisa Kovack and Haley Midgette, who respectively play the older and younger versions of main character Alice, both give fine performances. That said, it’s not hard for them to look good given how ropey the acting is elsewhere.The action starts in the present day when Alice’s documentary-maker daughter Corrina (Karen Scobie) films a homeless busker named Tom (Keith McKie) and shows the footage to her bohemian mother (Kovack). Alice immediately spots that Tom was the same American-born crooner she knew back in the day, a singer with a golden voice that harmonised with her own dulcet soprano. They became lovers and even made a record or two, but Tom got too deep into weed and LSD and they split up. She hooked up with someone else and he went off to the Himalayas in search of enlightenment and a haven from the military looking for more warm bodies to send to Vietnam.Once reunited, Alice and Corrina try to help Tom reintegrate to sedentary life and it’s to the film’s credit that this process is shown as neither straightforward or even entirely desirable. But then writer-producer-director Peter Hitchcock makes it all trite again by tying the storyline up in a neat bow with a bit of science magic and hugs. In the end this is hippy nonsense, less plausible than a tarot card reading. A Song for Us is out now on Prime."
Psychodrama review – Hitchcock thriller prompts tale of acting and abuse,"Traverse, EdinburghEmily Bruni stars as a mid-career actor who thinks she’s landed a dream role in a stage adaptation of Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho",4,"There is a theme emerging on this year’s fringe about male power and its abuses. You see it in Svengali, the tale of a controlling tennis coach, and in Guide to Surviving Masculinist Territory, which is exactly that. It is also central to this one-woman show about the professional indignities of the acting industry.Psychodrama takes as its starting point Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho and is a reflection, without ever stating as much, on that director’s complex relationship with the women he put on screen. So often, they are both star and victim, framed in the limelight but denied their agency.In Matt Wilkinson’s play, Emily Bruni plays a mid-career actor who believes she has landed the part of Marion Crane in a stage adaptation of the movie by Peter Coevorden, a famous Dutch auteur. It feels like we’re drifting into #MeToo territory but, drawing on anecdotes from an actors’ WhatsApp group, the play takes a broader swipe at a profession too tolerant of artistic and economic exploitation.Bruni, poised and centred on a spotlit chair, is a gifted storyteller, easing us into the tale with its backdrop of humiliating auditions and cliched bit parts in a world where youth and beauty always trump talent. Although her day job in a designer boutique is undemanding, it is a good deal more emotionally secure than her work as an actor, not least in the company of the messianic Coevorden who controls the people around him with a callous disregard for anyone but himself.If it finishes abruptly, leaving us uncertain about the resolution of the unfolding murder mystery, Wilkinson’s production dramatises the industry’s cruel status games with a vivid intensity. At Traverse, Edinburgh, until 28 August. All our Edinburgh festival reviews."
The Hating Game review – sugary Manhattan romcom that goes down easily,Peter Hutchings’ feature about mismatched colleagues who fall for each other has little going for it apart from the leads’ palpable chemistry,2,"This romcom set in a Manhattan publishing house is about as bland and as easily consumed as a cone of soft-serve ice-cream on a hot day. It’s essentially a sticky extrusion of sugar, trans fats and trapped air in cinematic form. Director Peter Hutchings has adapted a bestselling novel of the same name by Sally Thorne that pits perky executive assistant Lucy (Lucy Hale, from the Netflix series Riverdale and its spin-off Katy Keene) against square-jawed rival assistant Joshua (Austin Stowell, Hale’s co-star in Fantasy Island). He is a Waspy corporate type who turns out to be more pleasant than he first seems.As the title suggests, the two begin their relationship by seemingly loathing each other. They clash over issues of taste, given that Lucy started out in an upmarket literary fiction publisher and Joshua worked for a more mass-market house that published trashy supermarket-bound titles. The merger of their two firms results in the two sharing an office – desks facing each other across a gulf of class, opposing values and a rug – as they minister to the needs of co-CEOs Sakina Jaffrey and Corbin Bernsen.As is the way with these things, the protagonists are powerless to resist their mutual attraction, and their relationship turns more carnal in that classic device for inspiring love in such films: the confines of a lift. Before long they have a discreet office romance going, which involves attending a wedding together, spells where they break up and then get back together a couple of times, and a rival love interest in the shape of Damon Daunno’s nerdy graphic designer. All the squares on the romcom bingo card are eventually filled.Nevertheless, it’s hard to deny that Hutton and Stowell have a palpable chemistry. Now that the likes of Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey have moved on to building sportswear empires or flirting with careers in politics, a new generation of blandly good-looking romcom actors need to start cutting their teeth somewhere. The Hating Game is released on 15 August on digital platforms."
Between Two Dawns review – powerful workplace drama over safety failings,A workplace incident pitches a young man into a battle of conscience with his family and the law in Selman Nacar’s debut,3,"Turkish director Selman Nacar made a strong impression with his debut feature, a tough workplace-negligence drama at last year’s San Sebastian film festival. Its indirect narrative style and sense of insidious bureaucratic evasion put me in mind of the Romanian new wave: particularly the performance of Erdem Senocak as Yasin, the bland company lawyer whose task is to pressurise the families of injured employees into signing away their legal rights.Mucahit Kocak plays Kadir, a pleasant young man who, with his more business-minded elder brother Halil (Bedir Bedir), has taken over the management of the family’s textile factory, on the retirement of their father Ibrahim (Ünal Silver). The work is hard, and the factory is having difficulty delivering on orders, but Kadir is happy enough, excitedly making plans with his fiancee Esma (Burcu Gölgedar). But then his world is upended when an employee is severely burned by an inadequately maintained steam-cleaner and rushed to hospital. Was the worker at fault by not wearing the right safety gear, and being drunk on the job, as the firm instantly and heartlessly insists? Or is this a lie? The man’s wife Serpil (Nezaket Erden) refuses to sign Yasin’s document and an increasingly horrified Kadir discovers that he himself is being set up as the company’s fall guy in case of a prosecution and also that the family and the hospital are complicit in withholding the truth about the man’s condition.It’s a powerfully made film, though I was a little frustrated that it ends before we discover exactly what price is to be paid and what the outcome of Kadir’s crisis of conscience actually is. There is a tremendous scene in which Kadir has an uncomfortable dinner with his future parents-in-law, and is prevailed upon to play the saz (a kind of lute) for them, while inwardly agonising about his family’s secrets and lies. Between Two Dawns is available on 15 August on Mubi."
Luck review – pound-shop Pixar is a short straw for young audiences,This robotically made animated tale leads a young woman to a secret world that will surprise no one,2,"Another dismal, algorithmically produced digital animation here, evidently the first off the production line from a new US-Spanish company, Skydance Animation, which has the former Pixar chief John Lasseter as its creative head. Everything about this robotically made movie looks derivative and contrived; the videogame aesthetic is dull and the quirky high concept plays like a pound-shop knockoff of Inside Out and Soul.Sam (voiced by Eva Noblezada) is an 18-year-old kid who has grown up in a quaintly imagined orphanage-slash-girls’-home in an identikit US city. She has been plagued by bad luck all her life, not merely in being an orphan (the backstory there is primly never mentioned) but in tiny little things such as bumping into objects and losing her keys – although this micro-level bad luck could also be called klutziness. Just as she is moving out into her own apartment with a job (I guess no question of higher education), Sam becomes sadly preoccupied with a little kid in the home who is poignantly failing to get a foster family, just as she herself failed to. If only Sam could somehow give her a piece of good luck.Then Sam chances across a black cat in the street, and finds a lucky penny on the pavement; her luck changes, and she realises that this cat, called Bob (voiced by Simon Pegg) can speak – in a Mike Myers Shrek Scottish accent. And this adorable cat lives in the top half of a secret world where planet Earth’s good luck is manufactured: the bottom half, darker and gloomier, is where the bad luck is. Sam finds her way to this boring non-Oz and comes across many unfunny and uninspired characters, including lucky Irish leprechauns; it seems some stereotypes can be OK.Luck’s script is utterly zingless and contorted; it fails to imagine what the “bad luck” half of this secret universe looks like and ties itself in theological knots trying to explain the purpose of bad luck. The target audience deserves better. Luck is released on 5 August in cinemas and on Apple TV+."
"Vengeance Is Mine, All Others Pay Cash review – masterful send up of 80s action flicks","Combining adrenaline-pumping violence and a torrid love affair this is a homage to, and a subversion of, classic Indonesian cinema ",4,"Pulpy yet swooningly romantic, Edwin’s entertaining thriller has perhaps the coolest film title in recent years; it also won the Golden Leopard at last year’s Locarno film festival. Adapted from the popular novel by Eka Kurniawan – the first Indonesian writer to be nominated for the Booker prize – this is a bombastic time capsule of 1980s Indonesia that is all about the essence of manhood. Left impotent by a childhood trauma, Ajo (Marthino Lio) can’t get it up, but he can certainly raise his fists, earning a reputation as a daredevil who chases death just to prove his virility.Paved with hair-raising motorcycle duels and even murder plots, Ajo’s path towards self-destruction is cut short by his encounter with Iteung (Ladya Cheryl), a girl hired as the bodyguard for one of the young man’s intimidation targets. Cue the perfect meet-cute where the pair engage in thrilling hand-to-hand combat against the spectacular backdrop of a concrete dumping ground. And like any classic love scene, the camera lingers on their contorting bodies, accentuating the sensuality as much as the speed of martial arts moves.This paradoxical passion and violence is the beating heart of the narrative. Ajo and Iteung get married, and their wedding is followed by a trail of betrayals, homicidal revenges, and prison stints. These blood-soaked deeds are portrayed in a hilariously deadpan manner, which simultaneously pays homage to and subverts 1980s Indonesian action flicks. Considering that most of the baddies are ex-military figures, the film subtly conjures up the brutality that existed under Suharto’s New Order regime, when ideals of hypermasculinity ran rampant in popular culture.An adrenaline-pumping action fest that is ironic in many respects, Vengeance Is Mine, All Others Pay Cash swerves towards the mystical and the spiritual in the latter half, becoming a earnest and potent critique on the trappings of masculinity. Vengeance is Mine, All Others Pay Cash is available on 5 Aug on Arrow."
"What Josiah Saw review – a sharp, sleazy slice of southern gothic",Director Vincent Grashaw stitches together fragmented stories of grubby low-lives and festering family secrets to create an unsettling tapestry of sordid horror,4,"The French Dispatch and The Ballad of Buster Scruggs have recently shown how the anthology film is often content to supply a carousel of curios to amuse the viewer. But when the individual episodes aren’t merely self-contained but converge into a single conclusion, the portmanteau can supply a narrative kick like no other. Vincent Grashaw’s hunk of American gothic What Josiah Saw isn’t quite as accomplished as Pulp Fiction, whose intersecting trajectories and penchant for petty criminal sleaze it shares. But it has a stubborn, almost literary feel for character that accumulates a baleful momentum by the time the finale hits.Josiah (Terminator 2’s Robert Patrick) is the shock-haired, blowhard patriarch of the Graham farm, which is being eyed up by local fracking companies. Supping his “morning tea” (read: hooch), he only has youngest son Thomas (Scott Haze) for company – though the pair are haunted by the suicide of the latter’s mother, Miriam. Meanwhile subsisting elsewhere on the white-trash fringes is another son Eli (Nick Stahl, another Terminator alumnus), a feckless sex offender who is strong-armed into a sketchy heist to obtain a cache of gold from the Roma at the local fairground.Hovering over Josiah and Thomas’s bizarre dinner-table exchanges and Eli’s grubby encounters with low-lives and the law, Grashaw picks away at the family’s festering kernel. “There’s a hollow inside me – I can’t ever fill it,” says Josiah’s daughter, Mary (Kelli Garner), a mordant bourgeois pretender trying for a child. When the parties finally come together, over the oil-company offer, lurking psychological horror lurches into the full-blown physical kind. Slathering the climax with a crawling string section, the big reveal is straight out of the sordid southern-gothic closet, but the fragmented structure – clueing us in early as to how moral corruption seeps outwards – keeps the film sharp and contemporary. If only the depiction of the child-snatching Roma, which borders on racist, was that considered.That latter aspect is a shame, given the astute characterisation and performances elsewhere. The entire main cast are strong, but Stahl takes the prize as the sunken-faced, swivel-eyed piece of human flotsam who manages one last noble act before destiny catches up with him. What Josiah Saw is available on Shudder on 4 August."
Bullet Train review – Brad Pitt choo-chooses badly with runaway vehicle,All off-board for this sub-Guy Ritchie clanger in which Pitt plays a gonzo hitman outwitting quirky killers in the service of Sandra Bullock,2,"Let’s hope the estimable Brad Pitt isn’t giving us his leading-man swansong with this weirdly exhausting and overwhelmingly unfunny gonzo-violent action comedy set on a Japanese bullet train from Tokyo to Kyoto – with the film’s frantically hyperactive tempo cranked up in homage to the locomotive speed. This film would be an awful way for Pitt’s performance career to hit the buffers and he is given lines like: “He follows me around like … something witty.”It’s a semi-westwashed version of the bestselling 2010 novel by Japanese author Kotaro Isaka, and directed by David (Deadpool 2) Leitch, all about a bunch of wacky assassins aboard the train, their murderous destinies all chaotically colliding, and all turning out to have more to do with each other than they think.With the whip-pans and crash zooms, the sudden flashbacks, the voiceovers, stylised punchups, shootings and stabbings and inter titles introducing the zany characters and geezer crims – two of whom are cockneys and serious West Ham fans – this is worryingly like something by Guy Ritchie. (Although Brad Pitt’s eccentric performance as a traveller in Ritchie’s film Snatch is better than anything here.)Pitt himself, in goofy bucket-hat, nerdy glasses and superannuated surfer dude gear, plays a laidback hitman codenamed “Ladybug” whose handler (Sandra Bullock) gives him an easy job, to ease him back into the game after an uproarious series of calamities in previous missions.All he has to do is grab a cash-stuffed briefcase belonging to two other killers: Tangerine (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Lemon (Brian Tyree Henry) who have just rescued the son of a noted mobster from a kidnapping and this money is the ransom they didn’t need to pay. They both talk with poundshop Laarndaarn accents and Lemon has an obsession with, of all the quirky-cool things, Thomas the Tank Engine - an elaborate yet perfunctory character touch which is about 47% as funny and well-observed as it needed to be.Meanwhile there’s another bloodthirsty Brit aboard, codenamed the Prince: a psychopathic high-schooler played by Joey King, who has attempted to kill the infant son of fellow passenger, Japanese killer Kimura (Andrew Koji) and retains a sinister hold over him – but may yet have to reckon with Kimura’s own father, known as the Elder, in which role veteran player Hiroyuki Sanada comes closer than anyone in the cast to actually being cool.There’s another killer on the train called the Wolf (Benito A Martinez Ocasio) with a grudge against Ladybug, another called Hornet (Zazie Beetz) and towering over everyone in legendary evilness is the White Death (Michael Shannon) waiting on the platform at Kyoto.It rattles strenuously on and on and on with unexciting and uninterestingly choreographed fights, cameos which briefly pep up the interest and placeholder non-lines where the funny material should have gone. Pitt’s puppyish good nature keeps it from flatlining entirely but he doesn’t have anything like the script and direction that he got from Soderbergh or Tarantino or Fincher. And the Japanese setting is handled really cursorily; there are gags about Japanese toilets which should have gone out in the 1980s. This is a tourist ride to nowhere. Bullet Train is in cinemas on 3 August in the UK, 4 August in Australia, and 5 August in the US."
Not Okay review – a just okay satire for the influencer age,The dark comedy about a white woman who fakes trauma for clout is like many films about social media – at times unnerving but just a little off,3,"It’s an enduring paradox that for as much time as we spend on the internet – narrativizing ourselves, intaking others, dissecting content into takes and memes – very few films accurately capture the experience of social media or the head-scrambling velocity of being online. Recent attempts have fallen flat, either into cheap, simple didacticism (Mainstream’s message of internet = bad) or Zola’s hazy, languorous adaptation of what was a punchy viral Twitter thread. The good ones –Eighth Grade, Ingrid Goes West, Searching – have managed to convincingly portray the warping force of the digital world through maladaptations of human behavior, with a grasp on a specific micro-era of digital culture.Not Okay, written and directed by 27-year-old Quinn Shephard, aims squarely for the title of “internet film”. Its protagonist, friendless twentysomething Danni Sanders (Zoey Deutch), works as a photo editor at a Refinery29/Buzzfeed-esque digital media company called Depravity. Her bedazzled phone is totem, oracle, companion – she clutches it near constantly, pecks at it listlessly in her dark Brooklyn apartment. With her two platinum hair streaks and candy-colored rings, Deutch, who is also 27, looks like a Zoomer, and Danni calls herself a “zillennial”, but her obsession with social media perfection and becoming a New York writer feel distinctly millennial.To the even somewhat online, Shephard’s screenplay will recall a number of late-2010s viral phenomena, mashed up and rearranged into an original story which feels like Spotify radio – smooth, vaguely derivative, the enjoyment dependent more on familiarity than insight. Like the notorious internet celebrity Caroline Calloway (who appears briefly as herself), Danni is the child of rich parents who aspires to writing success without actual writing. Like Anna Delvey, the so-called “Soho grifter” who inspired the Netflix series Inventing Anna, Danni spins a web of intricate lies that win her fawning friends and, eventually, widespread scorn.Like Aubrey Plaza’s Ingrid in Ingrid Goes West, Danni is a talented mimic primarily motivated by obsession: first, with co-worker Colin (Dylan O’Brien), a weed influencer whose style – bleached hair, ambient vape cloud, Black slang-inflected speech – riffs on the internet thirst for e-boy dirtbags a la Pete Davidson. In order to impress him and spite more successful co-worker Harper (Nadia Alexander), Danni invents a writer’s retreat in Paris and photoshops her glamorous time abroad. As in Dear Evan Hansen, Danni’s silly and somewhat sympathetic lie escalates into an unforgivable, attention-grabbing one after a traumatic event: a fictionalized terrorist bombing in Paris that kills dozens.Unable to admit that she was never there, Danni barrels ahead: “Im ok and safe. I don’t have reliable service yet but please know I am alright. Devastated for those who are not,” she posts on Instagram stories. At a support group to bolster her story, Danni meets her second fixation, Rowan (an excellent Mia Isaac), a teenage school shooting survivor turned heralded activist, a la the Parkland survivors of March for Our Lives. Craving Rowan’s celebrity, genuine purpose and preternatural talent, Danni channels Rowan’s trauma into a viral article, a hashtag, and false clout.Danni is, clearly, not a person to root for, and it is a testament to Deutch’s bubbly yet grounded performance of anxiety that we care to see her growth, whether in the inevitable comeuppance or the seeds of an actual bond with Rowan. But Not Okay as a whole struggles with what to make of Danni’s house of cards, other than to illustrate that she can build them, that these things happen, that (surprise!) the desire for validation and main characters can breed a vampiric kind of fame. As in, say, a scroll through Twitter, Not Okay occasionally hits a nerve – the mini-thrill of the half-second between hitting post and your story hitting Instagram, the dopamine hit of a like with a blue checkmark next to it, the anxious weight of the “seen by” list. A scene in which Colin hooks up with Danni and uses her famous victimhood as dirty talk got under my skin. Danni’s confused mix of feelings toward Rowan – envy, concern, greed, loyalty – are a heightened version of the parasocial bonds formed through the Instagram portal.But these moments are undercut by the film’s looseness of tone and time, at odds with the fanged boldness and timestamped specificity of the online. Not Okay feels very 2019 but is set vaguely in the present – or at least, a time when everyone is always in the office, no mention of the pandemic. At times, it veers into blunt satire of a performative woke, clickbait-y workplace (“Depravity would be honored to give you a platform,” Danni’s editor says when she learns of Danni’s story). At others, it somewhat successfully parses the difference between Danni’s pathological narcissism and anxiety, which is less successfully, often uncomfortably, leveled with the actual trauma of a Black teenage shooting survivor.It’s only at the moving end, which hands the mic to Rowan, that Not Okay settles on something sharp, resisting a tidy redemption arc for Danni and suggesting something beyond an artfully arranged, well-acted pastiche. Not Okay is like many “internet movies” before it – approaching uncanny valley, somewhat obvious, just a little off — but this unsettling darkness makes it a solid entry into the canon of just-okay social media films.Not Okay is out on Hulu in the US and Disney+ in the UK and Australia on 29 July"
"Paris, Texas review – Harry Dean Stanton unforgettable in haunting classic","Wim Wenders’ iconic vision of American alienation, starring Stanton as a weatherbeaten drifter, has held its mystery for 40 years",5,"After almost 40 years, Wim Wenders’s Euro-Americanist masterpiece Paris, Texas feels as richly mysterious and mesmeric as ever: an outsider’s connoisseur-perspective on the US with its wailing, shuddering slide guitar by Ry Cooder which became as much of an instant classic as Ennio Morricone’s theme for The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. It mimicked the desolate beauty of the Texas desert and the micro-landscape of the star’s own weatherbeaten face. He was, of course, the unforgettably gaunt and haunted Harry Dean Stanton, who at 58 years old, and after a lifetime of self-effacing supporting roles, suddenly leapfrogged mere star status to become an icon.Paris, Texas is a beautiful-looking, beautiful-sounding film, although I have to confess to being unsure about the ending (reportedly one of a number considered by Wenders and his co-screenwriters Sam Shepard and LM Kit Carson). However, when I first saw it, I was hugely relieved about the way it turned out for Nastassja Kinski. I had been very worried about a sudden, final reappearance from Slater, the sinister, tough-looking guy that runs the peep show, played by Jarmusch regular John Lurie.Stanton is Travis, a dishevelled guy seen at first walking surreally alone through the parched west Texas desert in a shabby suit and tie, mute and clearly in some traumatised state, agonised by a secret history of guilt and shame. Finally, he is picked up by his longsuffering brother Walt, a wonderful performance from Dean Stockwell. Walt has, these four years, been looking after Travis’s infant son Hunter (Hunter Carson, son of the writer) after Travis suddenly vanished at the same time as his wife, Jane (Kinski).What the hell has been happening all this time? Walt and his French wife Anne (Aurore Clément) take Travis into their home, if not yet their hearts; and he lives with them in suburban LA, hardly more than a kid himself. Travis opens up about his dreamy long-forgotten plan to live in the little town of Paris, Texas where he was conceived, and he gets it together sufficiently to take Hunter on a road trip with him to Houston where he has discovered Jane is living. It is there he finds her working in a sleazy and somewhat bizarre peep show, a Lynchian touch.The lonely geographies of Texas and the unglamorous Los Angeles suburbs are superbly caught, and Wenders and Shepard indulge a love of motels with their heartbreaking neon signs about TV and air-con; this movie did much to make motels the signifier of roadside reality and the American heartland, and rescue them from the taint of Psycho and the Bates motel. Walt, incidentally, has a job creating billboards, the occasion for some witty scene-setting: he shows us a poster of Barbra Streisand’s face, distorted and foreshortened like the skull in Holbein’s The Ambassadors. There’s a great extended scene as Travis walks across a highway bridge to the accompaniment of a male voice ranting hysterically. Is it the radio? No: it’s a disturbed guy screaming into the traffic whom Travis has been calmly approaching this whole time, and passes with a casual pat on the shoulder.Finally, there are those amazing, climactic scenes in the peep show, a metaphor for Travis and Jane’s alienation from each other. Kinski has the supremely difficult job of showing us Jane’s backstory in just two scenes. As Travis starts telling her their story (without revealing who he is), Kinski shows how Jane is at first bemused, then startled, then moved by what she still thinks is this story’s fortuitous resemblance to her own, and then her devastation at the truth.The sordid loneliness and weird alienation of these sequences, coming after the more reassuring story of domestic comfort and father-son bonding, delivers the film’s enduring impact. It is an eerie, sad story whose meaning disappears over the vast horizon as if on a highway heading away through the desert. Paris, Texas is released on 29 July in cinemas and on 5 August on Curzon Home Cinema."
"Fire of Love review – romantic portrait of passionate, doomed volcanologists","Documentary embraces the mythology around Maurice and Katia Krafft, the husband-and-wife scientists who died in the 1991 Mount Unzen disaster",4,"On 3 June 1991, the Mount Unzen volcano in southern Japan erupted catastrophically, killing 43 people, among them the volcanologists Maurice and Katia Krafft, a married couple who had become legendary for their passionate devotion to the study of volcanos; their daredevil films, photographs and books documented their breathtakingly dangerous closeup study of volcanoes in mid-flow. I first heard of them from Werner Herzog’s film Into the Inferno.But where Herzog’s film has something dispassionate, almost fatalistic in its awe in the face of the volcano’s terrifying power, this film looks for something romantic, celebrating or consecrating the myth of the Kraffts: they loved each other, they loved volcanoes and it all came together on that terrible day. Maurice in fact often casually talked about the probability of dying in a volcano eruption – although the film shows him talking about it happening to him, not to both of them together. Did they really, in their hearts, think that it could happen? Or did their lifelong acclimatisation to danger inoculate them against that thought?Either way, this film shows how their buccaneering volcanology was born decades before in the countercultural spirit of the late 60s – they were the new generation challenging the placid dullness of scientific work. They soon learned to distinguish between two different sorts of volcano. The “red” type, with its mighty red rivers of lava was paradoxically less dangerous than the “grey” type with its explosive detonation of dull ash, rocks and dust, which could swallow you up in a moment – which is what happened to the Kraffts in Unzen.They really were amazing personalities: almost like children, although they came to be depressed that their work was not inspiring governments to work on evacuation protocols. Perhaps Herzog understood something about the Kraffts that this film doesn’t quite, for all its fascination: the element of the danger cult, or death cult, in their work. I found myself thinking of Timothy Treadwell in Herzog’s film Grizzly Man, the amateur grizzly bear enthusiast who hung out with grizzlies in the wild until one killed him. Fire of Love is released on 29 July in UK cinemas, and on 25 August in Australia."
Hit the Road review – irrepressible defiance in beautifully composed debut feature,"Directed by Panah Panahi, the son of jailed Iranian film-maker Jafar Panahi, this tense family drama is drenched in a subtle but urgent political meaning",5,"Great child acting is rare: so is great adult acting, and so is great directing of children and adults. But they all come together in this lovely, beautifully composed debut feature drenched in a subtle but urgent political meaning. It comes from 38-year-old film-maker Panah Panahi, son of the Iranian director and pro-democracy activist Jafar Panahi, who has this month been sentenced to six years’ imprisonment for criticising the Iranian government.It takes the form of a road movie, though that Hollywood term doesn’t really cover Hit the Road, which is part of Iranian cinema’s entirely distinct genre of films shot semi-covertly in a car, and has evolved to avoid Iranian state snooping. It is a mode of film-making using the interior possibilities of the car, which is both prop, symbol, mobile location and means of transporting cast and crew about without attracting attention during filming. Abbas Kiarostami’s Taste of Cherry and Jafar Panahi’s Taxi Tehran are other examples.In Hit the Road, a family is making a tense, hot, uncomfortable road trip in a borrowed car through remote north-western Iran, heading apparently for the Turkey/Azerbaijan border. The elder son (Amin Simiar) is at the wheel, a quiet young guy who says little but often seems in the grip of an intense, suppressed emotion. Pantea Panahiha is excellent as his mum, sitting in the front passenger seat, bantering drily with her husband (Hasan Majuni) in the back: a shambling, grumpy bear of a man with a broken leg in a plaster cast and a consistent need to smoke. Next to him is a wacky 8-year-old boy, played by Rayan Sarlak, who gives a glorious performance: always clowning around, winding down the window and winding everyone up. Their ailing dog, Jessy, in the back, keeps needing to be taken out for calls of nature.There is an elephant in the room, or rather the car. The family are lying to this kid about why they are on the road. They have told him that his elder brother is leaving the country temporarily to get married. It is a tale that makes the grownups tense and the little boy hyperactive. The film shows us that he does not really believe it, and that goofing around is at least partly a symptom of his unease at this explanation. Is their journey a strange sort of game? Or a surprise? A lark? At any rate, he knows that something is off, and he is testing their lie to destruction with bad behaviour. Meanwhile, the mother panics when she thinks they are being followed (in fact, the motorist behind wanted to alert them to coolant leaking out of their air-con unit) and also panics when her younger son confesses to bringing a mobile phone along, against her instructions, which she confiscates, destroying the SIM card. This is criminal activity. Or possibly antigovernment activity?It’s also about displacement activity: about all the things that the adults do to distract the child and themselves from the awful truth. The mum lip-syncs to an Iranian pop song on the radio and suddenly the film has a rush of Bollywood energy, or maybe Tollywood energy, straight from Tehran. The film brings back in its final moments an uproarious and oddly moving lip-sync spectacular in which the fate of Jessy becomes a marker for their unspoken anguish and grief.Cinephilia is an important part of this film, and the elder son has a scene where he explains to his mum why he loves Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey, which inspires a woozy, visionary moment of intimacy between father and younger son. Incidentally there is a similar scene in Richard Linklater’s Apollo 10 ½ – perhaps the Space Odyssey explanation is going to become a rite-of-passage for all film-makers.Running through it all is a streak of sadness and even terror: something they are not quite facing up to. The family is heading for a grim farewell and loss involving not just the elder son, but maybe also the parents who could get into serious trouble and be taken away from their adored younger boy. This family could be blown into pieces. And yet an irrepressible defiance and comic energy bubbles under every scene. Hit the Road is released on 29 July in UK cinemas, and 25 August in Australia."
Anything’s Possible review – Billy Porter’s sweet but uneven trans teen rom-com,"The Pose actor’s patchy directorial debut follows a black trans teenager in Pittsburgh as she strives to thrive, rather than just survive, senior year",3,"Representation can be a double-edged sword. There’s undeniable power in seeing oneself reflected on screen, in normalizing marginalized identities, but an emphasis on visibility alone can reduce complex characters to one identity, one presentation, a checkbox on a list. This is the fine line walked by Anything’s Possible, a coming-of-age rom-com directed by Pose star Billy Porter, and in its smartest moments, the predominant internal dilemma for Kelsa (Eva Reign), a confident yet guarded Black, transgender teenager in Pittsburgh who, in her own words, wants to thrive in her senior year of high school rather than just survive.Porter’s directorial debut, written by trans screenwriter Ximena García Lecuona, relies heavily on such hashtag parlance, which splits the 96-minute film, out on Amazon this week, about evenly between banal (if well-meaning) cliches and fresh fun. Example: “My best friends make survival look good,” Kelsa says in one of her YouTube videos, which double as voiceovers and effective segues. The comment alone is sassy and an effective introduction to her besties – diva Em (Courtnee Carter) and punk Chris (Kelly Lamor Wilson), both outsized personalities without much backstory – but gets run into the ground by the script’s consistent comparison of high school life to the animal kingdom, a la Mean Girls. (Kelsa, an aspiring zoologist, compares Chris to a howler monkey and the feeling of a crush to “having a freshwater eel in your throat”.)Kelsa, like any high school girl, has some pressing concerns: she wants to get out of Pittsburgh for college in New York or LA. She’s trying to find the balance between uninhibited expression (all three girlfriends’ outfits take a page from Porter’s reputation as a gender-fluid fashion maven) and being treated like a normal teenager; she often invokes the “law of averages” to her single mother, played with almost too-fizzy energy by Renée Elise Goldsberry (Girls5Eva, Hamilton’s original Angelica) – as in, treat her as any average mother of an average teenage girl would.But true to life and cinematic form, Kelsa is most pressed about a guy: Khal Zubai (Abubakr Ali, giving serious Dan Humphrey vibes), a nice Muslim boy whose Egyptian parents pressure him to attend a “good” four-year university. (It is refreshing to see a character aspire to attend a local trade school, instead of the Ivy League dreams of protagonists in recent teen films such as the To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before trilogy, Along for the Ride and Hello, Goodbye and Everything in Between.)Khal, stammering and sweet, reciprocates Kelsa’s attraction, and the first half of the film is an immersive fall into like, then love, with them – despite Em’s stated interest in Khal, a roadblock that feels more contrivance than convincing. The two are bashful and endearingly awkward in person, but self-assured and confessional online – Kelsa in her YouTube videos, which evolve from diaristic accounts of hormone blockers to laments of making everything about gender to just relishing a crush; Khal as an anonymous Redditer in r/relationships, where he both dispenses and seeks advice (Lecuona has said a real Reddit post about asking out a trans girl inspired the screenplay.)At times, the film gestures at thorny contradictions – Kelsa wants to speak directly about “trans stuff” on her public YouTube channel, but doesn’t want too much attention, wants Khal to care for all of her but not focus her trans-ness, wants to be seen and loved but not fought for. These paradoxes are specific to Kelsa’s experience but also broadly relatable to adolescence in the internet age, figuring out one’s identity and the balance between expression and over-exposure.Unfortunately, the film hastily buries those complexities in a hairpin twist toward villainy, courtesy of Em and Otis (Grant Reynolds) – Khal’s best friend, a Black teenager whose blatant transphobia feels airdropped in – then just as hastily resolves most of said villainy for the sake of resolution. Until the bittersweet coda, the film’s second act devolves into what feels like an attempt to throw in references to as many pressing (and genuinely upsetting) trans issues as possible – bathroom bans, the false moral righteousness of TERFs, the terrifying experience of going viral on an internet full of trolls, white women co-opting Black women’s pain for attention. Any one of these scourges could have been interesting territory for testing Kelsa and Khal’s relationship with unfortunate, painful reality, but the result is less nuance than a cacophony of tweets-as-dialogue that don’t really add up to anything cohesive.Thankfully, Anything’s Possible is light-hearted enough to glide past all that. Porter films his hometown of Pittsburgh with clear appreciation, though the film’s school scenes are stylistically indistinguishable from numerous Netflix teen productions. With a mop of dark curls brushed over batted eyes, the 31-year-old Ali looks younger than he is, but too old to be talking about SATs and college applications. Still, his chemistry with the dynamic Reign, more than up to the task as romantic lead, is enough to see their relationship through to the inevitable departure into the unknown, open future.The answer often given for a lack of representation, trans representation specifically, on-screen is more, on all fronts, in all roles and genres. Anything’s Possible is another needed step in the right direction – a just-fine high school romantic comedy about an unapologetic, bold trans teenager on a major streaming platform.Anything’s Possible is now available on Amazon Prime"
Where the Crawdads Sing review – Daisy Edgar-Jones wasted in terrible southern Gothic schmaltz,Normal People star deserved a better Hollywood debut than this solemnly ridiculous film and its outrageously evasive cheat ending,1,"Daisy Edgar-Jones was a lockdown smash for her excellent performance in the BBC’s Sally Rooney adaptation Normal People, and she deserved better for her Hollywood debut than this uncompromisingly terrible southern gothic schmaltzer based on the humungous US bestseller by Delia Owens. It’s a relentless surge of solemnly ridiculous nonsense in the style of romdram maestro Nicholas Sparks (creator of The Notebook and Message in a Bottle) culminating in a courtroom trial with Edgar-Jones’s free-spirited heroine in the dock as the Manic Pixie Dream Girl Murder Suspect. Defending her is David Strathairn as the white-suited decent liberal lawyer and it is at this stage that this film plays like an all-white reboot of To Kill a Mockingbird with Edgar-Jones somehow getting to play Scout and Tom Robinson at the same time. And the big twist ending is an outrageously evasive cheat.The scene is the beautiful and dangerous marshland of North Carolina in the 50s and 60s, a place “where the crawdads sing”; crawdads being crayfish that apparently sing metaphorically, doing their crayfish thing when no human beings are around. Edgar-Jones plays Kya, a young woman who has basically raised herself in a remote shack (there is only the tiniest bit of tastefully restrained five-string banjo picking on the soundtrack). She’s had to learn to survive when her drunken and violent Pa (Garret Dillahunt) drove Kya’s mother away after years of domestic abuse; her siblings fled and Pa finally keeled over. So as a teenager Kya is basically on her own, making a living by selling freshwater mussels to the local store, roaming wild and free on the wetlands in her outboard motorboat and drawing pictures of the local flora and fauna with her amazing untrained artistic talent.Kya is subject to much paranoid misogynistic abuse from the local townsfolk, who are also racist to her only allies: the black store-owners played by Sterling Macer Jr and Michael Hyatt. But two very similar-looking local blond hunks fall in love with Kya. One is a decent young fellow called Tate (Taylor John Smith) who is just about to go away to study at Chapel Hill; she does a bit of kissing with Tate while the lakewater sploshes around them, like Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr in From Here to Eternity. The other guy is boorish high school quarterback Chase (Harris Dickinson), whose dead body is found in the marsh, just underneath the fire tower. Kya is arrested for his murder. She pleads not guilty. So was Chase’s death an accident? Or did someone else kill him?And so the drama drones on and on and on, leaving us to wonder, with increasing urgency … when, oh when, are we going to get the crucial flashback to which we are surely entitled? The scene when the film shows us, on screen, moment-by-moment, what actually happened, and what responsibility the participants actually have. Well, suffice it to say that what we get is a hilarious and ridiculous cop-out, a cakeist twist that left me yearning for the gators gliding around in the marsh to chomp down on everyone involved. Where the Crawdads Sing is released on 22 July in cinemas."
The Big City review – Satyajit Ray’s miraculous look at a new world of possibility,The struggles and triumphs of a 1950s Kolkata family whose highest earner is a woman is told with marvellous lucidity in an optimistic masterpiece,5,"Satyajit Ray’s magnificent movie from 1963 is now rereleased as part of a Ray retrospective at London’s BFI Southbank, and what a pleasure to marvel again at this film’s freshness, its fluency, its directness, its powerful and essential optimism. Ray’s lucid storytelling always strikes me as a kind of miracle whenever I see this film. He makes the miracle look easy.The setting is Kolkata in the early 1950s and Subrata Mazumdar (Anil Chatterjee) is the harassed employee of a bank which – though he doesn’t know it – is on the verge of going under. He is reasonably happy with his lot, with a humorous, distracted manner, often absent-mindedly smoking or eating during conversations. He lives with his wife Arati, whose sensitivity, sweetness and darting glances of insight are wonderfully portrayed by Ray’s great leading actress Madhavi Mukherjee. But their household is crowded: there is their young son Pintu (Prasenjit Sarkar), Subrata’s kid sister Bani (Jaya Bachchan) and also his elderly parents – mother (Sefalika Devi) and grumpy father (Haren Chatterjee), a retired teacher who is enviously obsessed with the fact that all his ex-pupils seem to be well off while he is ending his days hardly more than a pauper in the home of his not-particularly-well-off grownup son.Keenly aware of the need for more housekeeping money, Arati upends everything her menfolk know about life. She boldly applies for and gets a job as a door-to-door saleswoman, ringing on doorbells and encouraging the lady of the house to buy from her a state-of-the-art knitting machine, with which, she promises, you can run up a jumper in an hour. (The firm is evidently the Kolkata franchise of a western company, Autoknit, whose white models are up on posters in the city’s branch office.)After a nervous start, the smart and personable Arati is a huge success: she is the star of this movie and now the star of her own breadwinning family life, much admired by her grinning boss Mr Mukherjee (Haradhan Bannerjee). Encouraged by her flighty new best friend at work, an Anglo-Indian woman called Edith (Vicky Redwood), Arati uses lipstick and becomes a modern woman about town in sunglasses. Meanwhile, her husband is thoroughly humiliated and emasculated by his wife’s sensational triumph; her father-in-law is increasingly hostile for the same reasons, and Arati’s success accelerates his own depression. This creates a diplomatic froideur with Subrata, whose mother also disapproves of the upstart new job. In an attempt to defend Arati, Subrata says: “Do you know what Bernard Shaw says about working women …? Oh … forget it.” (I always wonder what Subrata was about to quote. Perhaps it was: “The domestic career is no more natural to all women than the military career is natural to all men.”)The poor ailing old dad, perhaps out of some masochistic need to prove to himself how well the young people are doing and how poor he is, tours the city in the burning sun asking for favours from his old pupils. From one, an ophthalmologist, he begs for new glasses, after uneasily turning over the pages of Esquire in this man’s waiting room, with its racy pictures of young European women.Mukherjee’s luminous performance as Arati, at once modest and sensual, is an absolute treat, perhaps especially when she is paid for the first time. In the ladies’ bathroom she takes the crisp, new notes out of the pay-packet and fans them under her nose, inhaling and smiling inscrutably at herself in the mirror. What is she thinking? Perhaps it is: this is what independence feels like; this is what a new world of possibility feels like.The men feel it too, in a very different way. Arati is earning as much as them and more, and her work is enjoyable and exciting and modern. No wonder they resent it. Disaster looms, but Arati and Subrata are to be romantically reconciled and her wonderful final lines are: “Such a big city … so many different jobs … surely one of us can find a job!” The big city is the hero, not the villain, of the story: a place where they can start afresh. The Big City is released on 22 July in cinemas."
Notre Dame on Fire review – high adventure ripped straight from the headlines,Veteran director Jean-Jacques Annaud rips a swashbuckling escapade from news footage of the catastrophic fire at the Paris cathedral,3,"Veteran French director Jean-Jacques Annaud serves up some high-octane film-making with this old-fashioned disaster movie, composed in a docu-realist style, about the catastrophic fire that engulfed Paris’s Notre Dame cathedral in 2019. With dramatic reconstructions, digital effects and the splicing in of amateur video, social media material and genuine news footage – President Macron himself appears at one stage to be talking to an actor playing the fire chief – Annaud rips a pretty swashbuckling adventure from the headlines. A terrifying blaze, flying buttresses about to collapse and molten lead pouring from the roof on to the believers below; and Annaud cheekily intersperses the thrills with a querulous old lady who keeps calling the fire brigade because her kitten has got out on to the roof: France has, as they say, picked the wrong day to quit smoking.There are some startling scenes, all apparently accurate, showing cathedral officials desperately trying to rescue the most precious possessions: the Crown of Thorns, a vial of Christ’s blood, a fragment of the true cross and a nail from the crucifixion. And no one even murmurs the possibility that these are medieval artefacts. As far as these people are concerned: these are the real thing, and this glassy-eyed belief in their authenticity, and the ecstasy at their deliverance, is somehow more important than issues around the incompetence that caused the fire in the first place: it gives the film a slightly reactionary sheen.That’s not to say it isn’t perfectly watchable and it gives us in the UK food for thought. How long before the Houses of Parliament go up in flames in exactly the same way? Notre Dame on Fire is released on 22 July in cinemas."
McEnroe review – a deep dive into the psychology of a sporting phenomenon,Barney Douglas’s documentary on the tennis champion stands alongside Asif Kapadia’s films on Senna and Diego Maradona,4,"Solid sports documentaries are 10 a penny. Sports documentaries that delve so comprehensively into the psychology of their subject, which position them both in the cultural landscape and in a transformative moment of their chosen discipline, are less common. Barney Douglas’s doc about tennis maverick John McEnroe belongs to that rare handful of portraits that should find an audience far beyond just fans of the game itself. In this, it has a kinship with Asif Kapadia’s films Senna and Diego Maradona.There’s one key difference, however – while the subjects of Kapadia’s films are now dead, McEnroe is still very much alive. And while not mellowed exactly – an evocative device shows the grizzled former champion prowling around the night-time streets of the city that shaped him, New York – the film finds him in a contemplative mood. Through extensive interview footage, both with McEnroe and those close to him, archive material and some slightly unwieldy CG graphics, the film unpicks the experience of being a phenomenon and a hate figure for a kid who was barely out of his teens."
Don’t Make Me Go review – mediocre family weepie with a cheap twist ,Amazon’s road trip tale wastes John Cho and newcomer Mia Isaac on an extended sitcom episode that leaves a sour taste in the mouth,2,"At the beginning of Amazon’s cutesy father-daughter tale Don’t Make Me Go, a voiceover tell us: “You’re not gonna like the way this story ends, but I think you’re gonna like this story.” Almost two hours later and the prophecy was only half-correct. For the way that the film ends is a genuine text-your-friends-and-spoil-it-for-them-in-caps shocker, for all of the very worst reasons, a cheap, emotionally manipulative head-scratcher of a twist that leaves one with a sour taste in the mouth that lingers. But even before the dramatic left turn, all the way over the cliff and into flames, this ho-hum road trip comedy drama was already hard to like, an unspecific sitcom of eye-rolls and finger-wagging.It’s unsurprisingly the work of an ex-This is Us writer, a network soap of shameless string and rug pulls, and perhaps ardent fans might find something here to mope over in that show’s recent absence. But for the rest of us, a film that should be radiating warmth and humanity is in fact surprisingly cold, almost factory-made, a drama about the messiness of family that feels far too tidy. The often under-utilised actor John Cho at least makes the most of a rare lead role, echoing similar single dad energy from 2018’s devilishly entertaining cyber-thriller Searching. In Don’t Make Me Go, there’s nothing as nefarious pulling him and his daughter apart but, ultimately, something equally life-threatening.Cho’s Max finds out early on that those headaches he keeps experiencing are in fact the result of a terminal brain tumour, which gives him two unpleasant options. The first is surgery, but with only a 20% chance of survival, and the second is, well, nothing, and facing up to his final year of life. He opts for the latter in order to prepare his 15-year-old daughter Wally (newcomer Mia Isaac) for life without him. But he chooses not to tell her, and instead decides on a road trip both to attend a high school reunion and to track down the mother who abandoned them both years earlier.Appearing on The Black List a decade ago, the annual list of the most-liked un-produced scripts in Hollywood and originally titled A Story About My Father, it’s baffling to see why something as generic and listless as this would have survived the long journey to the screen. It feels more like a sample script than a passion project, written to get staffed on something such as This is Us (timing-wise that may very well be what happened), and there is a clinical competency to writer Vera Herbert’s perfunctory dialogue. But it’s less a believable representation of how actual people talk and more of how characters in a show would, a slick but empty back-and-forth lacking in any detail or nuance, every expected beat from a father-daughter dynamic recycled without energy or thought.It’s a shame, because Cho and Isaac, also impressive in this month’s social media satire Not Okay, try their very best, as does director Hannah Marks, all bringing their A game to a script that barely deserves their C (although Marks’ decision to use Iggy Pop’s overused The Passenger twice in a road movie deserves an enthused thumbs down). It’s their combined effort that crawls this out of one star territory, although I wavered in the heinous finale as the aforementioned reveal crash-lands into view. I’ll often forgive a deranged and poorly foreshadowed last-act twist in a horror or thriller, the heightened territory allowing for such silliness, but in a grounded film that takes itself as seriously as this, it’s much harder to stomach and impossible to forgive.It’s a bizarre act of audience manipulation that only serves to highlight the overall incompetency of the script, relying on something this wild to distinguish itself from the great number of similar family dramas like it. The tears that the film so desperately wants us to find ourselves soaked in never come. Our eyes are far too busy rolling.Don’t Make Me Go is now on Amazon Prime"
Roadrunner: A Film About Anthony Bourdain review – genius painted in broad strokes,The hungry wanderer’s wit and intellect make for compelling viewing in an otherwise conveyor-belt documentary,3,"Here it is, finally arriving on Netflix, the Anthony Bourdain documentary that sparked controversy last year when director Morgan Neville revealed he’d used AI to bring the chef’s voice back to life – three poignant lines from an email he’d sent to an artist friend. “My life is sort of shit now. You are successful, and I am successful, and I’m wondering: are you happy?” Bourdain took his own life at the age of 61 in 2018. In the end, the AI deepfake gimmick is perhaps the most interesting thing about what is otherwise a conveyor-belt film with plenty of talking heads, some more fawning than others. (Rule of the thumb: the more famous the interviewee, the fewer the insights.)Bourdain had been “a mediocre chef in a middling restaurant” – his words – when his memoir Kitchen Confidential shot up the book charts. At the time, food was the new rock’n’roll, and Bourdain was like a cross between Iggy Pop and William Burroughs – a bad-boy former drug addict with a dry, laconic wit. At 43, he had thought all his adventures were behind him. Instead, Bourdain landed a TV show – A Cook’s Tour, later Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations – which took him around the world. The film-makers have done a terrific job here trawling through episodes, stitching together footage to create a portrait of a man who went out in the world with open eyes, hungry for encounters and meaning.The film is a reminder of just what a brilliant writer Bourdain was. He describes falling in love with Vietnam as being “pheromonic” and, like meeting the woman of his dreams, “inexplicably it looks and smells right”. Fame led to the breakdown of his first marriage. The 250 days a year he spent on the road filming resulted in a friendly divorce from wife number two, mother of his daughter. I was uncomfortable with how some of his friends framed Bourdain’s final romance with the film-maker Asia Argento; blame the woman.Bourdain says at one point that the greatest sin is mediocrity – a little of that creeps into the film perhaps. Not that Bourdain would have cared. He professed not to give a hoot what happened to him after death: “Throw me into the woodchipper and spray me into Harrods in the rush hour.” Roadrunner: A Film About Anthony Bourdain is available on 15 July on Netflix.In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

The Railway Children Return review – family classic sequel stays on track ,Plot riffs on the original story include a black US serviceman on the lam in this earnest but likable homage to the beloved 1970 kids’ adventure,3,"Jenny Agutter became a British cinema hall-of-famer as Roberta, or Bobbie, in the much-loved 1970 family classic The Railway Children, about three children forced by circumstance to move with their mother to a cottage in Yorkshire and have adventures involving steam trains. She returned to play the mum in a 2000 TV movie version, and now Agutter is back as her original character, 40 years older, in this sparky sequel imagining a new generation of railway children in 1944, a reboot devised and co-written by producer Jemma Rodgers and directed by Morgan Matthews.Maybe it’s a bit self-conscious in the way it revives and reimagines the classic plot points, and there could be historical authenticity issues. Would US army military police really have been allowed to arrest an underage British civilian and transport her across country in handcuffs? But there’s a fair bit of fun, channelling bygone classics such as Hue and Cry and Whistle Down the Wind.Three evacuee kids from wartime Manchester, Lily (Beau Gadsdon), Pattie (Eden Hamilton) and Ted (Zac Cudby) fetch up in exactly the same village where Roberta has apparently stayed on and is now a kindly grandmother: her daughter (Sheridan Smith) is the headteacher of the local school and has a slightly Just-William-ish son called Thomas (Austin Haynes), whose dad is away in the RAF fighting the Germans. Railway Children fans may be forgiven for wondering if any more legacy characters from the original film are going to be revived, or if we will find out if Bobbie really did marry Jim, grandson of the “Old Gentleman” in the first tale, as seemed likely. Well, suffice it to say we discover that Bobbie became a convinced suffragette as a young woman and, on those grounds, comes very close to the blasphemy of disagreeing with Winston Churchill. Now it appears the family apparently have a kindly old uncle, or great-uncle, played by Tom Courtenay, who is something hush-hush in the War Office.Lily, Pattie and Ted roam around the place with their new friend Thomas, getting involved in scrapes with the local kids who resent them, and they get to know the peppery stationmaster Richard, played by John Bradley. But the grownups are aware of tension with the American military police who have a racist attitude to the African American GIs who are popular in the village. This adult problem becomes a reality in the children’s lives when they find a wounded, shivering black American soldier hiding in one of the railway engines in a siding; this is Abe (Kenneth Aikens), who sternly tells them he is on a secret mission and they must not on any account tell anyone that he is there. Earnestly, the four children fetch him food and supplies and agree to hide him in their house.This is a film with a touch more savvy about the real world than its 1970 forebear, at least partly because it has child actors who are the same age as their characters. The now legendary scene from the first film in which Bobbie sees her daddy through the steam on the railway platform – a scene which has become more iconic than its creators ever quite envisaged – is echoed and doubled in a new dream that Lily has, in a much more serious context. And there are more shenanigans involving holding up signs to a passing train and getting it to stop. It’s an amiable and ingenious tribute to the innocent, good-natured spirit of the original. The Railway Children Return is released on 15 July in cinemas."
Futura review – fascinating snapshot of Italy’s young adults,"In this charming documentary, Italian teenagers from across the country share their hopes and fears as they contemplate the future",4,"Three Italian directors – Pietro Marcello, Francesco Munzi and Alice Rohrwacher – take the pulse of their country by talking to the individuals who make up its future. It’s a simple idea: a series of interviews with young people on the brink of adulthood, exploring their hopes and concerns as they move into the next stage of their lives. But this lovely, thoughtful documentary, which visits cities, suburbs and provincial communities, has a cumulative power.The film-makers couldn’t have anticipated it, but the fact that the production was interrupted by the pandemic brings an added depth to the insights – youngsters in the process of deciding who they are find their journey disrupted, their certainties shaken. Some talk eloquently, some glare at the camera with cagey mistrust. But the point of this worthwhile and frequently fascinating project is that all have the opportunity to be heard."
Brian and Charles review – a very British robot story,David Earl and Chris Hayward’s moving buddy comedy about a man who builds a companion in his shed has charm to spare,4,"Mary Shelley’s archetypal “Modern Prometheus” narrative is given an absurdist modern twist by actors and co-writers David Earl and Chris Hayward in this sweet-natured and hugely likable odd-couple fable about an eccentric inventor and his ramshackle robot. Mixing DIY physical-comedy charm (there’s a touch of Silent Running’s anthropomorphic drones in the droid’s boxy movements) with sentimental tragicomic melancholia, this Sundance festival favourite offers a delightful antidote to the horrors of the world news cycle and the cynicism of the blockbuster franchises that currently pass for “fantasy” entertainment.“I was very lonely,” explains Brian (Earl), a singular fellow who lives in a remote cottage in the valleys of north Wales, where he spends his time in his “infamous inventions pantry” (AKA his cowshed). Here, he knocks together outlandishly madcap creations such as the pinecone bag, the flying cuckoo clock, the egg belt and trawler nets for shoes – until one day the discovery of a fly-tipped mannequin head gives him bigger ideas. Like an amiable cross between Caractacus Potts and Victor Frankenstein, Brian drags the disembodied head and an old washing machine into his workshop and, with a little help from a convenient lightning storm, breathes haphazard life into a childishly sentient robot.This is Charles (Chris Hayward), a latterday Tin Man with wildly mismatched body parts and a glitchy Max Headroom voice who wouldn’t seem out of place in a Wallace and Gromit animation. “I am your friend,” declares Charles, whose twitchy feet are made for dancing and whose wonder at the world around him (“How far does the ‘outside’ go? Does it stop at the tree?”) weirdly recalls that of the young survivor from Room. Brian thinks its best to keep Charles (who grandly adopts the surname “Petrescu”) a secret from the locals, and so the pair spend their days playing darts, cooking cabbages, riding bikes, having pillow fights and watching TV travel shows that give Charles a wanderlust to visit places like “Hono-loop-loop”.It’s an idyllic existence, ecstatically captured in a montage played out to the Turtles’ Happy Together. Yet all too soon, electronic adolescence dawns and Charles starts to resemble a stroppy teenager, albeit one whose tiny head looks more like that of an eccentric professor and whose wayward manner will strike a chord with anyone who has experienced older relatives succumbing to the strange infantilisation of Alzheimer’s.The characters of Brian and Charles grew out of an internet radio show and a live standup act that spawned an eye-catching short film in 2017. In that original screen incarnation, the only real narrative tension came from Brian locking Charles in a shed after he pilfered one of his prize cabbages, before sending him off to live under a tree – a decision he almost instantly regretted. For the feature, there’s clearly a need to up the dramatic ante. Thus we are introduced to local bully and bonfire-builder Eddie Tommington (Jamie Michie) whose family terrorise the neighbourhood; and to Hazel (Louise Brealey), a kindred spirit who lives with her domineering mother and a talkative parrot, and whose company Charles instinctively encourages Brian to court, with tenderly touching results.Director Jim Archer, whose television CV includes stints on the BBC’s The Young Offenders and Channel 4’s Big Boys, says that Brian and Charles is “primarily about loneliness and the power of friendship and companionship”, a theme this marvellously raggedy film shares with more polished stateside AI productions such as Marjorie Prime and, more particularly, Robot & Frank. Here, the humour is distinctly British, with the nervous laughter of Brian’s to-camera monologues (the film has a very loose mock-doc structure) evoking the spirit of Ricky Gervais, with whom Earl has collaborated on shows such as Derek, with which this shares some tonal similarities.Director of photography Murren Tullett lends a glowing cinematic grandeur to the bleakly beautiful widescreen exteriors, while composer Daniel Pemberton’s score blends nursery-rhyme innocence with an electronic sheen that perfectly embodies the duelling elements of Charles’s fairytale-like character. The result has homemade charm to spare, proving delightfully ridiculous but also poignant. Oh, and while this may not be a megabucks Marvel movie with umpteen fatuous end-credits scenes, it’s well worth sticking around for the Charles Petrescu rap that is nestled away at the very end of the film."
Thor: Love and Thunder review – sentimental multimillion-dollar romp ,Chris Hemsworth’s Thor suffers an existential crisis in director Taika Waititi’s self-satisfied follow-up to Thor-Ragnarok,2,"It’s quite an achievement for a film-maker to put their own personal stamp on a multimillion-dollar studio production movie quite as empathically as Taika Waititi has done, first with Thor: Ragnarok and now with Thor: Love and Thunder. Zack Snyder manages it; the films of James Gunn bear the recognisable fingerprints of their director. But Waititi is in a different league. There are moments in Love and Thunder when the film feels like a $185m megaphone, dedicated solely to amplifying the voice of Taika Waititi. Response to the film will be neatly divided along the line between those who are convinced that he can do no wrong and those who find his brand of chipper mateyness and disingenuous sentimentality increasingly irksome. I find myself veering towards the latter camp.We join Thor (Chris Hemsworth) in the midst of an existential crisis, having never fully moved on from his relationship with Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). The hammer-wielding Asgardian with the disconcertingly Oxbridge accent is moonlighting with the Guardians of the Galaxy. There’s a moment, after Thor has defeated a bunch of alien hell-owls on flying bikes, but destroyed a crystal temple, the cherished institution he was meant to be protecting, when he is congratulating himself, in his rousing toff voice, on a job well done. And you wonder if a moment of satirical political commentary has snuck into the screenplay. For the most part, however, this romp, which pits Thor against Christian Bale’s cadaverous God-slayer, is superficial stuff – a film that brings a greeting-card triteness to its themes of love and sacrifice; that harvests internet memes (screaming goats) in the service of easy laughs."
Persuasion review – a travesty of Jane Austen ,Theatre director Carrie Cracknell’s ham-fisted adaptation misses the naunces of the author’s writing and opts instead for romcom sassiness,1,"The sweet spot for period literary adaptations is to combine an instinct for the spirit of the original work with a distinctively modern sensibility. Greta Gerwig’s Little Women handled the balance elegantly; and The Personal History of David Copperfield, in the hands of Armando Iannucci, matched irreverent humour with respect for Charles Dickens’s classic. But this adaptation of Jane Austen’s Persuasion, by the theatre director Carrie Cracknell, from a screenplay by Ron Bass and Alice Victoria Winslow, is a travesty.The gauzy melancholy of Austen’s story about lost loves reunited is mothballed in favour of a sassy romcom reading of the material. Anne Elliot (Dakota Johnson) was persuaded not to marry the then penniless Frederick Wentworth (Cosmo Jarvis) seven years before. But now, with fortunes reversed, they meet again. Cracknell beefs up the humour by having Johnson repeatedly make winking eye contact with the camera. It’s such a tone-deaf device, demonstrating so little sensitivity to the delicate precision of Austen’s writing, that you wonder why she didn’t just go the whole hog and bung in some comedy trombone quacks and an audience laugh track.Persuasion is on limited release in cinemas and on Netflix from 15 July"
Eric Ravilious: Drawn to War review – fascinating portrait of the great British artist,"With contributions from family, friends and fans including Grayson Perry, this vivid documentary argues that Ravilious should be as famous as Turner and Constable",4,"He was one of the most prolific and – at the time at least – beloved English artists of the mid-20th century. Working in watercolour, pen and ink and woodcut engraving, Eric Ravilious’s work combined an arcane Englishness steeped in nature, rolling landscapes and pagan embellishments with a sensibility that was bold in its modernity and economy. His admirers, interviewed in this fascinating and characterful documentary by Margy Kinmonth, include Grayson Perry and Ai Weiwei. But Ravilious lapsed into almost total obscurity until his children rediscovered his drawings some years after his death. Even now, he is not widely known. The film makes a case that Ravilious should be regarded, alongside the likes of Turner and Constable, as one of Britain’s great landscape artists.So why did Ravilious slip through the net? He was, in the words of his wife, Tirzah Garwood, “not quite a gentleman”, so class prejudices may have played a role. But it’s possible that his untimely death at the age of 39 – he perished in a plane crash in 1942 while serving as a war artist – also contributed to his relative obscurity. Rediscovery is long overdue."
Wayfinder review – Larry Achiampong’s poetic lockdown odyssey,"A young wanderer encounters social injustice in the artist’s melancholy, sometimes magical feature set in a near-future England",3,"Created during lockdown, the latest work from British-Ghanaian artist and film-maker Larry Achiampong is a poetic odyssey, a top-down journey through a near-future England, divided into chapters. It follows a young woman (Perside Rodrigues), known only as the Wanderer, as she travels the country, bearing witness to its iniquities and injustices. Through a fabric of narrating voices, the film touches on race, economic imbalance, the housing crisis and gentrification, among other themes.The approach is superficially similar to the work of Andrew Kötting, although the playfulness and humour that characterises his travelogues is absent here. There are moments of magic: the loamy folk vocals of artist Mataio Austin Dean, who sings twice in the film, gave me goosebumps. And the film conveys a pervasive sense of melancholy: a kind of real-time bereavement for lives that are increasingly marginalised in the name of progress. But there are moments in which the picture’s wafting lyricism works against it – points that need, or deserve, to be more emphatically made."
Tigers review – gripping true-life tale of a troubled Swedish football prodigy,Erik Enge excels as Inter Milan wunderkind Martin Bengtsson in Ronnie Sandahl’s impressively knotty look at the psychology of top-tier sport,4,"A Swedish teenage football prodigy who is acquired by a top Italian team finds that the high price tag placed on his skills doesn’t necessarily transfer to his self-worth, in this impressive, knotty examination of the psychology of sporting excellence. The second feature from writer-director Ronnie Sandahl (who also wrote the screenplay for the tale of tennis rivalry Borg vs McEnroe), Tigers is inspired by the real-life story of Martin Bengtsson.Erik Enge is remarkable in the central role of Martin. He’s a gauche, driven kid with braces and a notebook in which he writes, in his naive child’s hand, motivational notes to himself: Train Eat Recover. But he finds himself in a world that, while not exactly grownup – the other junior team members are arrested in a kind of petulant permanent adolescence – is full of adult temptations and challenges.Ostracised by the fact that he speaks no Italian, and struggling to understand the animosity that’s directed at him by the other players, Martin finds a friend in American teammate Ryan (Alfred Enoch), and a girlfriend, Vibeke (Frida Gustavsson), a Swedish model coasting in a job she no longer cares about.But Martin’s career, according to the slick-suited men who treat young players like expensive additions to their toy box, should come before all else. Lonely, depressed and in crisis, he finds that dark thoughts rush into the hole where his emotional support system used to be. It’s an accomplished, unusually sophisticated take on the sports movie genre, which marks Sandahl out as a premier league talent."
Nitram review – a harrowing portrait of Australia’s most deadly mass shooter,"Based on the true story of a lone gunman who killed 35 people in Port Arthur, Tasmania, in 1996, Justin Kurzel’s drama is a complex study of a lethal misfit",3,"At a crucial moment in this quietly harrowing drama from Justin Kurzel, director of Snowtown, Macbeth and True History of the Kelly Gang, a young man walks into a gun shop with a bag of money and walks out with an arsenal of firearms. What’s remarkable is how horrifyingly matter of fact the scene is, with its casual talk of throwing in ammo rounds and “nice” carrying bags. Yes, there’s a slightly sticky moment when the young man reveals that he doesn’t have a licence, but that’s circumvented when he agrees not to register his purchases. So the deal is done; hands are shaken, money is exchanged (“a pleasure, thanks for your business”) and lethal weapons are sent out into a world where no one is safe.For most of its running time, Nitram is not about gun control – or at least, it doesn’t appear to be. Instead, it presents a thoughtfully intimate account of the belated coming-of-age struggles of a misfit loner, superbly portrayed by Caleb Landry Jones, who earned best actor accolades at the 2021 Cannes film festival and at the Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts awards, where Kurzel’s film swept the board. Mockingly nicknamed Nitram (his name reversed), this spiky, emotionally unstable figure lives with his mum and dad in mid-1990s suburban Australia. His father (played in almost unrecognisably downtrodden form by Anthony LaPaglia) loves his son, but struggles to contain his reckless impulses, such as giving lighted fireworks to children at the local school. Meanwhile, his mum (Judy Davis, wearing her jagged nerves on the outside) exudes flinty exasperation and resigned defeat at her wayward offspring’s behaviour.When Nitram clumsily embarks on a lawnmowing business, he is greeted by hastily closed doors, until he meets Helen (Essie Davis). An eccentric woman of wealth with a menagerie of dogs and cats, Helen buys the overgrown boy clothes and a car and allows him to move in – making the break from his parents. For a while, this odd couple seem to be enjoying an off-kilter Harold and Maude-style relationship. But the honeymoon period cannot last, and Nitram’s destructive urges soon leave him alone in the house, with his thoughts and her money. Meanwhile, his dad’s dreams of setting up a rural bed and breakfast suffer a setback that sends him spiralling into depression, to the horror of his son.Screenwriter Shaun Grant, who previously collaborated with Kurzel on Snowtown and True History of the Kelly Gang, began working on the script for Nitram, which he calls “an anti-gun film”, after being in the US in 2018 in the wake of two mass shootings and seeing a former athlete on TV vigorously defending his right to own a semi-automatic hunting rifle. Recalling the Port Arthur massacre of 1996, which still hung like a dark cloud over his home country (it was the worst mass shooting in Australian history, leaving 35 people dead and 23 others wounded), Grant resolved to write a script around that still-raw wound. It would, he hoped, cause “the audience, especially those pro-gun, to sit with a character who clearly should not have access to firearms and watch as they are so easily granted access to them”.For better or worse, Nitram, which aroused great consternation in Tasmania for daring – or perhaps presuming – to dramatise such horrific recent history, does exactly that. It places its audience in the deeply uncomfortable position of watching a young man’s mental health issues accelerate inexorably from a personal problem to a national catastrophe by the insane addition of easily accessible guns. Impressively, the film avoids portraying its central character – a stranger to remorse who replaces empathy with aggression – as either monstrous or sympathetic. He may have suffered taunting bullying as a kid, but when the surfers with whom he pathetically hopes to ingratiate himself give him the cold shoulder, we understand why.This is as it should be for a film that ultimately is not about its titular character (or his unnamed real-life inspiration), whose crimes are kept offscreen. We never see the devastation he wreaks, nor do we need to. All the horror the film needs to tell its story is there in that gun shop."
The Black Phone review – Ethan Hawke shines in a supernatural chiller,Director Scott Derrickson brings depth and dramatic detail to conventional horror themes,3,"After a brief but well-regarded segue into the Marvel universe with Doctor Strange, director Scott Derrickson returns to his horror-drama roots with The Black Phone, a solid, spooky period chiller. Like his breakthrough picture, The Exorcism of Emily Rose, it combines conventional horror themes – in this case a masked child murderer (fully and terrifyingly inhabited by Ethan Hawke) and a supernatural element – with a rewarding depth of dramatic detail. The backdrop, blue-collar Denver in the late 1970s, is evoked through a nicotine and spilled Coors palette and the kind of parenting that is hands off apart from the occasional beatings.Finney (Mason Thames) and his sister Gwen (Madeleine McGraw) live in fear of two things: the Grabber, the mysterious man behind a string of child abductions, and their own father, who whips them when any hint of their mother’s psychic ability manifests in them. It’s this ability, however, that might just save Finney when he is snatched. A disconnected phone in the basement prison links him with previous victims, each with a crucial hint on how to escape."
The Big Hit review – impressive French prison comedy-drama,"Based on the true story of a drama teacher who worked in a high-security jail, this film crackles with charm and nervous energy",3,"A middle-aged, down-on-his-luck actor, reduced to teaching Maori hakas as part of corporate-bonding exercises, takes a job working with prisoners in a high-security jail. Impressed by the talent and their raw, unconventional energy, he decides to put on a production of Waiting for Godot, in this amiable, French comedy drama, which is based on a true story. Somewhat montage heavy and repetitive initially, the film hits its stride in the unexpected final act. A baggy, slightly defeated-looking Kad Merad is impressive as drama teacher Étienne. But the standout performances are in the supporting cast of prison inmates, in particular the crackling nervous energy of Pierre Lottin, as the jittery, borderline illiterate Jordan, and Sofian Khammes, who brings an unnerving blend of charm and menace to gang boss Kamel."
The Sea Beast review – dazzling maritime adventure,"A terrific animated escapade from Netflix, in which a plucky orphan hooks up with a misunderstood monster of the deep",4,"Big Hero 6 director Chris Williams jumps ship – literally – from Disney to Netflix for this immensely enjoyable animated maritime adventure. Aiming its harpoon at everything from Moby-Dick to Master and Commander, the film unfolds in a distant past in which generations of brave hunters have battled with a variety of fearsome monsters of the deep. But what, the film asks, if the real enemy is not the giant fish that is just going about its business, but a power that is rather closer to home? A few slightly pantomime-voice performances apart, this is terrific stuff, a rousing buddy movie between plucky orphan Maisie (Zaris-Angel Hator), fearless hunter Jacob (Karl Urban) and a misunderstood horned monster nicknamed Red. The film features dazzling action and a fantasy world that is realised with an almost tactile level of detail. Seek it out on a monster-size screen if at all possible."
"Moon, 66 Questions review – oblique view of a family reunion is a cinematic pleasure",Greek director Jacqueline Lentzou’s elliptical tale of an estranged father and daughter is a supremely confident debut,4,"There’s something dispiriting about the kind of hand-holding film-making that doesn’t trust the audience to follow a story – it suggests a fundamental lack of faith in the language of cinema. Which is why, perhaps, the teasingly elliptical, oblique storytelling of Greek writer/director Jacqueline Lentzou is such a pleasure. Her feature debut, Moon, 66 Questions, is the work of a film-maker who is already supremely confident in her craft.Showing the reunion between a young woman, Artemis (a fascinating and mercurial Sofia Kokkali), and her long-estranged father Paris (Lazaros Georgakopoulos), the picture’s impulsive, unfettered approach mirrors Artemis’s erratic nature. Her age is not specified but, returning after a long absence to Athens because of a sudden deterioration in her father’s health, Artemis seems to regress to the teenager whose relationship with him was characterised by distance and a sullen restraint on both sides. There is a space between them even now. “Does it hurt,” asks Artemis, reaching towards her father’s hand. But she doesn’t quite touch him, her fingers hover just above his. There’s a sense of remove in the way the camera is used – a whole scene is shot through the distorting lens of a magnifying glass. Later, when a physiotherapist shows Artemis how to support her father, their bodies, forced into physical contact, are rigid with discomfort.Bored, slightly rebellious and working through her own destructive issues, Artemis explores her father’s space until she finally stumbles upon a secret that explains his reticence. As the enigmatic, tarot-inspired title suggests, questions remain, but Lentzou leaves us with the sense that this long-stalled relationship can finally move forward."
There Are No Saints review – Schrader script is schlocky revenge thriller,An attempt to resuscitate a Mexico-set Paul Schrader crime movie – complete with a dodgy Tim Roth cameo – fails miserably,1,"A new film with a Paul Schrader script has to be news … but this isn’t exactly new. It’s a grungy, grubby and frankly dreary exploitationer in the straight-to-video mould, with a perfunctory and shallow religious motif and nasty misogynist scenes, which has actually been on the shelf since 2014, after Schrader was replaced as director by Alfonso Pineda Ulloa and Succession’s Brian Cox with Ron Perlman.Mexican actor José María Yazpik (from Almodóvar’s I’m So Excited) plays a notorious gang enforcer nicknamed the Jesuit (after the Spanish Inquisition’s torture habits); he is newly released from prison in Texas and brooding on going straight when his ex-wife Nadia (Paz Vega) is murdered by her vicious new husband Vincent (Neal McDonough), who also abducts the Jesuit’s son and takes him to Mexico. So the Jesuit follows this guy south on a terrifying quest for his boy, with revenge on his mind and murder in his heart, taking with him a stripper called Inez (Shannyn Sossamon) whom he met in the film’s “sexposition” scene in a lapdance club, and whom he apparently needs to pose as his wife. Tim Roth plays the Jesuit’s dodgy British lawyer and he phones his performance in with a cockney-geezer accent.The film clunks on, acted with no flair or charisma by anyone in the cast and no energy or interest in the direction. A Rodriguez or a Tarantino – or, indeed, a Schrader – might have found something in the film’s episodic structure and its gallery of grotesques, but, as it is, this is just leaden. There Are No Saints is released on 27 June on digital platforms."
Theo and the Metamorphosis review – provocative drama of nudity and hating,"An initially intriguing slice of secluded life descends into hollow indulgence, the kind of film that gives arthouse cinema a bad name",2,"Guided by a deliberately monotonous first-person narration, French director Damien Odoul’s cryptic exercise in loneliness unscrolls like a visual diary. The opening half of the film has an observational documentary style, as the camera stalks about a secluded cabin in the woods where Theo (Theo Kermel), a young man with Down’s syndrome, lives with his photographer father. The line between nature and civilisation gradually erodes as the pair frequently roam around in the nude. Theo – or TO as he likes to call himself – even watches loud porn with his father sitting in the same room.When the patriarch leaves for a work trip, the film sheds its realist veneer. From its tone of deference, TO’s voiceover morphs into impotent rage and resentment, as he speaks about a near biblical hatred towards his father. Forbidden desires and fantasies flare up like an unquenchable fire that annihilates any sense of stylistic as well as narrative coherence.Unfortunately, this is when the initially intriguing slice of secluded life descends into hollow indulgence. TO’s somewhat amusing dream of becoming a trained samurai mutates into orientalist nonsense, as the film cooks up a porridge of Asian cultural practices that the young man wants to emulate, from jujitsu, tai chi, and Indian deities, to the Chinese philosophy of Qi.There’s also a juvenile delight in provocation for provocation’s sake that is simply exhausting. Repeated nude vignettes and closeups of male genitalia being played with or mutilated soon evolve from playfulness into simplistic tactics to evoke the psychosexual turmoil that takes hold of TO. All in all, the only metamorphosis worth mentioning here is the film’s own transition into the kind of tiresomeness that gives arthouse cinema a bad name. Theo and the Metamorphosis is released on 24 June in cinemas."
Our Bodies Are Your Battlefields review – sensitive study of trans women’s struggles,"Filmed with power and insight in Argentina, the documentary conveys a feeling of intimacy and closeness",3,"What makes this documentary about a community of transgender women in Argentina so powerful is the feeling of intimacy and closeness. Director Isabelle Solas films her subjects with sensitivity and insight – and in return they open up their lives for the camera. That said, the film doesn’t exactly make it easy for audiences outside Argentina, giving virtually no explanation or context. It opens with scenes from the 2018 trial of a man convicted of stabbing to death a trans woman, Diana Sacayán. But it takes a bit of Googling to learn her story: Sacayán was a high-profile transgender activist murdered in 2015. The conviction of her killer was historic – the first in Argentina under laws against gender-motivated hate crimes.The film focuses on two trans women. One is veteran activist Claudia, a funny, witty force of nature who is doing her damnedest to lobby feminist groups for more trans inclusion. We see her passionately and persuasively making the case for common ground at a rally. “History has made us invisible too, it has persecuted us, it has murdered us, humiliated us.” Claudia is close to her family: her elderly mother beams with pride sitting next to her daughter.That’s not the experience of other trans women in the film, who talk of being disowned by their families, pushing some into sex work. Many share their stories with Violeta, a cool and soulful anthropology researcher and trans activist, who is the film’s other focus. Being trans is dangerous in Argentina; one activist points out that life expectancy is just 35 years in Latin America as a whole. In her early 50s, she is beating the odds. Still, the film ends on an optimistic note: Violeta at an exhibition celebrating trans culture and history – wall after wall of black and white images from the archive of gorgeous trans women done up to the nines. Our Bodies Are Your Battlefields is available from 22 June on Mubi."
"Moon, 66 Questions review – elusive but rewarding study of family tension",Jacqueline Lentzou’s highly anticipated debut feature follows a daughter struggling to reconnect with her ailing father,3,"Jacqueline Lentzou’s debut feature is a difficult, elusive, but ultimately rewarding study of a daughter struggling to reconnect with her father: it’s a film which – initially at least – appears to occlude its own meaning with mannerisms which I associate with the absurdist style of the Greek new wave.Sofia Kokkali plays Artemis, a young woman who has been away from her Athens family for a long time, but comes home when her father, Paris, (Lazaros Georgakopoulos ) suffers a stroke, rendering him hardly able to walk and all but speechless. Somehow, the responsibility of caring for Paris falls on Artemis while her extended family interview live-in caregivers and squabble about how to proceed. Meanwhile, her mother, estranged from Paris, seems detached from the whole situation, and Artemis is faintly disquieted to be reacquainted with an affectionate family friend: Iakovos (Nikitas Tsakiroglou).It is all the more painful for Artemis because she and her father argued constantly in her teen years: the kind of confrontation which, in one agonised and faintly surreal scene, Artemis reenacts while alone in her bedroom, playing both parts, before finally collapsing in tears. The action – at first displayed through disorienting closeups and odd camera angles – is broken up with references to tarot cards and the phases of the moon, as well as old analogue video footage which Paris appears to have shot himself 20 years before with his own commentary, footage whose emotional meaning is effectively withheld until the very end of the film.There is a kind of unemphasised intensity about this movie, which makes the climactic dialogue scene between Artemis and Paris effective, although I wondered if there was not perhaps a little too much tricksiness and contrivance in the way the “discovery” was managed and the opening scenes were shot. But Kokkali persuasively enacts both the emotional hurt and emotional healing. Moon, 66 Questions is released on 24 June in cinemas."
Summer in the Shade review – teenage girls bond in study of anxious adolescence,Cornish holiday of two 13-year-old friends is shadowed by ominous premonitions of what will become of them,3,"It’s a sultry summer in the late 1990s and 13-year-old Grace (Niamh Walter) leaves her parents and their troubled marriage behind in London to visit Cornwall with her best friend Asta (Nyobi Hendry) and Asta’s boho-cool mum Kate (Rebecca Palmer). There are woods to mess around in, plenty of time to wonder what kissing boys will be like, and long-leash supervision from Kate who lets the girls run free. Nevertheless, the every-night’s-a-sleepover atmosphere is darkened by Grace’s menace-suffused dreams, rabbit corpses that keep popping up out of nowhere, and a handsome but intrusive male presence in the shape of Sid (Zaqi Ismail), who comes to visit. A shy, watchful only child who is having one of those adolescent religious phases, Grace is troubled by her knowledge of dad Rupert Shelbourne’s infidelity and her mother’s sorrow, but has also internalised her dad’s prejudice against “fat girls”. She looks primed to develop either an eating disorder or a drug habit, or maybe neither of the above. It’s that point in a life when everything is possible.Director Alice Millar and screenwriter Isobel Boyce jointly evoke the sensuality and protean quality of 13-year-old girls, especially the delicate kittenish power struggles between friends over who is more sophisticated, but also who is more authentically a child. The period setting is especially useful here because, instead of spending all their time staring at their phones like most contemporary teens, these two are still interested in building dens in the woods. But they also want to decorate the structure with flowers: “I think it’s really important that it’s attractive as well as functional,” says Asta, clearly channelling mum Kate’s sensibilities. And while the warm, sun-flare-dappled cinematography is credited to Benjamin J Murray, Millar’s experience as a director of photography pays off with a strong visual identity that runs through everything, from the lighting to the warm orange hues in the costumes and production design.Less assured, however, is Millar’s touch with the young actors; they struggle a bit to make the dialogue sound natural. Meanwhile, the film’s ambition to evoke a sense of dread, especially with a droning, almost John Carpenter-ish sort of soundtrack, doesn’t quite come off somehow, and the last act is maladroit and all over the shop. Still, it’s an interesting, promising feature debut for Millar, and Walter has real star presence. Summer in the Shade is available on 20 June on digital platforms."
A Mother’s Fury review – mom goes on the warpath after son dies in frat-house hazing,Siobhan Fallon Hogan is a force of nature as a feisty Irish Catholic mother who goes on a quest for justice in this watchable revenge-tragedy,3,"This watchable if undeniably on-the-nose drama follows middle-aged American mother Barbara (Siobhan Fallon Hogan) on a quest for justice after her first-year student son Jimmy (Jay Jay Warren) dies at a party in his frat house after imbibing an excess of alcohol and pills. In entirely believable fashion, the son’s university refuses to admit any responsibility for Jimmy’s death. But Barbara is a feisty Irish-Catholic with red hair, and has an unquenchable devotion to her children – although her focus on them, especially her ill-fated eldest son, comes off a little dysfunctional in the early part of the film as she calls Jimmy incessantly to hear how his pledge week is going. After his death, and a period of mourning and housecoat wearing, she goes on a long road trip to gather information about other kids who died in hazing rituals in order to either get a news story published or put pressure on her local senator to do something about the harmful effects of these initiation ceremonies.As it enters the home stretch, viewers who haven’t done their research might be thinking this film could be something based on a true story about a crusading, working-class woman defeating the weaselly educational institutions or the formidably well-funded “Greek” network of fraternities and sororities. But then it goes off in a whole other revenge-tragedy direction, which is kind of barmy but also much more satisfying.Few actors would have been able to pull this off like Hogan, who is not only the star but also the film’s screenwriter and producer. She’s one of those “who-is-that-again?” character actors you’ve seen hundreds of times before in all sorts of films, from Men in Black to Lars von Trier’s Dogville and most recently Clifford the Big Red Dog; she is ordinary looking but also radiant, a force of nature in a fringed buckskin coat. Danish director Vibeke Muasya just rolls with it and lets Hogan steer the ship. A Mother’s Fury is available on 20 June on digital platforms."
Lightyear review – Toy Story spinoff boldly going beyond with a treat from Pixar,This cracking origin story for Toy Story’s spaceman hero is fun and clever and reminds us why we loved Pixar in the first place,4,"To infinity – and even further back! Lightyear is a treat: a time-travelling, space-ranging, animated adventure in the spirit of classic sci-fi. It is a prequel origin-myth for the Buzz Lightyear spaceman figure from the Toy Story movies, that lantern-jawed and gung-ho astronaut sonorously voiced in the original by Tim Allen and now by Chris Evans. Lightyear might not precisely be up there with the very creamiest of the Pixar crop but it reminds you why we loved Pixar in the first place: wit, fun, storytelling and heart. It does, however, leave untouched the crucial question of whether “Buzz” is his given name or his nickname. I naturally spent this film waiting for someone to call him Edwin Eugene Lightyear Jr. But no.In the original films, Sheriff Woody was the cowboy toy taken from a hokey TV show called Woody’s Roundup. Now it transpires that Buzz Lightyear – who once threatened Woody for dominance in the toy collection of a kid called Andy, just as sci-fi superseded the western in Hollywood myth-making – was taken from a sleek and exciting movie called Lightyear. And the opening titles explain that this is that very movie, the film that generated the merch of which Buzz was a part. It was therefore supposedly made in the early 90s, the era of the first Toy Story set in 1995. Young Andy must have had his mind blown at this film’s digital effects and perhaps also by its admirably forward-thinking attitudes on LGBTQ+ representation. It also has a very startling twist. What a strain it must have been for Buzz, Woody and everyone else never to have mentioned that.Well, now we get to see Lightyear in civilian clothes and in fatigues, and often without the snugly fitting skullcap that goes under his helmet. Now we see his brown hair, cut short: the effect is to make him rather boyish and vulnerable. With his commanding officer and best friend Alisha Hawthorne (voiced by Uzo Aduba), Buzz finds himself marooned on a hostile planet when their vast mother-ship crash-lands there. The hundreds of personnel on board are ordered to make the best of things and build a temporary community in this remote place, while fearless pilot Buzz makes a series of test flights out into space to see if the hyperspeed necessary for escape is even possible.But the awful truth is that these attempts mess with the space-time continuum: after each 60-second flight, he comes back to find four years have gone past. Buzz keeps poignantly flying out, while everyone else gets older and dies off. Finally he returns to find a new generation of commanding officers who tell him they are just staying and that he must now give up on thoughts of getting away. But doughty Buzz (eerily forever young) is not to be put off and finds himself making common cause with Alisha’s smart, grownup granddaughter, Izzy (voiced by Keke Palmer) and a ragtag group of volunteers. Under Buzz’s command, their destiny is to confront the evil Emperor Zurg, voiced by James Brolin.Wittily, this film shows us the living scenes and personae of which the famous toys were a simplification, and it gives us new characters into the bargain: notably a robot cat companion for Buzz called Sox (voiced by Peter Sohn) who, though not especially original, adds to the film’s good-natured fun. The film just bounces along, zipping through its running time. Now surely we need Pixar to give us a heart-rending Revolutionary-Road-style drama about the early married life of Mr and Mrs Potato Head. Lightyear is released on 16 June in Australia, and 17 June in the US and UK."
Spiderhead review – Netflix’s prison-experiment fable is going nowhere,"Tale of lab-rat detainees testing psychoactive drugs, presided over by a creepy Chris Hemsworth, rather loses its way",2,"Here is a rather self-conscious sci-fi satire, directed by Joseph Kosinski and adapted by Deadpool screenwriters Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese from George Saunders’s New Yorker short story Escape from Spiderhead, published in the collection Tenth of December – which someone in this film is actually shown reading, an unbearably smug piece of brand cross-promotion.Miles Teller plays Jeff, a convict who some time in the future has been given the chance to serve his term in the relatively cushy Spiderhead unit for experimental psychology, run by the oleaginous Dr Steve Abnesti (Chris Hemsworth). Jeff is there on condition that he, like all the other specially chosen lab–rat prisoners, consents to have various hi-tech drugs flooded into his system from a special unit fixed to his lower back: drugs to make him irrationally happy or sad or horny (in the company of a similarly doped prisoner), while Dr Abnesti and his increasingly unhappy assistant Verlaine (Mark Paguio) look on from behind the two-way mirror. And in a Stanford-type refinement of cruelty, Dr Abnesti will also invite Jeff back to this observation deck and monitor his undrugged reactions on being told to choose which of two prisoners behind the glass gets the “pain” treatment.Jeff’s relationship with another prisoner Lizzy (Jurnee Smollett) will provide the movie’s crisis point and we will finally discover the full truth about why Jeff is in prison after a cheatingly fudged flashback scene. There is some fetishistic interest in the way Dr Abnesti administers all these dosages from his smartphone, though this hi-tech touch makes a certain vitally important old-fashioned tatty leather-backed file-binder a little bit implausible in this brave new world. A nice, creepy performance from Hemsworth, with Teller gamely going along with the script, but having stretched out the story idea to feature-film length, the film doesn’t really give the sense that it knows where it is going. Spiderhead is released on 17 June on Netflix."
Goya’s horrific Black Paintings are brought to life – La Quinta del Sordo review,"Prado, MadridPhilippe Parreno’s filmic re-creation of Goya’s late murals, full of his bleakest visions, is like a time machine that lets us see this ghostly space through the artist’s eyes",5,"In 1819, deaf, old and ill, Francisco Goya moved into a house known as the Quinta del Sordo, or House of the Deaf Man, on the southern outskirts of Madrid. Removing himself from the proximity of the royal court and the political turmoil of the city, he lived here for the next four years, principally working on preparatory drawings for his ongoing series of etchings, Los disparates, or Follies, and on the cycle of murals whose 14 images have come to be known as the Black Paintings. Using oils, he painted directly on to the plaster walls, covering over a number of landscapes that already decorated them, suggesting that the images he created there were made only for himself. Neither they nor his last great series of etchings, and their accompanying drawings, emerged until some years after his death, in exile in Bordeaux in 1828.Two hundred years later, the Black Paintings remain by turns nightmarish, bitter, funny and tender. They come across as wounded, both as images and as objects. They have suffered a lot. Goya’s paintings were eventually cut from the walls (some say “hacked”, though the technique used to remove and conserve them was a skilled task) and transferred on to canvas in the mid-19th century. Paint was damaged or lost, and at least one was cut down in size.Among the most enigmatic works of his turbulent life, they now occupy a single room at Madrid’s Prado museum, whose collection they entered in 1881. Why Goya painted them, and even if they were all originally painted by the artist himself; how much he revised and changed them, and how much they were further altered by early restorers – all that remains a matter of debate. There is also conjecture about his house (which got its name not from Goya, but from the previous occupant), which was demolished in 1909.A few steps away from the Black Paintings takes us 200 years into the future, to a room of similar proportions, temporarily converted into a small cinema by the French artist Philippe Parreno, where he is showing La Quinta del Sordo, a film first seen at a Goya exhibition in Switzerland last year. Now it is paired with the paintings that provide its subject. Typically of this complex artist, there is more to it. Several times a day, the lights go down and a cellist takes a seat beside the screen, reading a statement by Spanish composer Juan Manuel Artero before beginning to play.“Preludes, as we know, are like a time machine,” he reads, before playing a short solo composed by Artero. “They present something that has not yet happened.” When Parreno’s 40-minute film is over, the cellist takes up his bow a second time to play a sonata by Luigi Boccherini, an 18th-century Italian composer who had a place at the court in Madrid, and who had once been a friend of Goya’s. The prelude played before the film begins is itself a variation on Boccherini. The music is, Artero says, a time machine and a mirror, like the film.Parreno’s film oscillates between surface and depth, light and shadow; between sound and vision, the pictorial spaces Goya created and the walls of the rooms they originally covered. This oscillation continues, like a tilting gyroscope, between past and present. At the end of the film, we see a crossroads at dusk, street lights, a row of buildings. We hear the traffic and the screeching brakes of a local train taking a bend in the track.Parreno calls his film “science fiction”. This may seem contentious, until we learn about the 3D computer model he created of the house, which included the placement of the paintings in relation to windows and doors and to one another. Parreno was then able to make an acoustic model to simulate the way sound travelled through the building, the creak of its doors, footfalls on the wood floors, light and birdsong coming in through its windows. It is a kind of speculative architecture, a ghost space.His film also employed a camera capable of shooting the Prado’s own high-definition scans of Goya’s images at half a million frames per second; this seems to generate a hiss, as if coming from the paintings themselves. There are further tilts and gyrations, between the paintings and our apprehension of them and the rooms they once inhabited, and the space inside a deaf man’s head.How daylight fell and crossed the paintings, how shadows and murk and candlelight illuminated and obscured them as he moved about. How we saw, going from surface to depth as the fitful light raked their surfaces. How sound came and went, was heard and not heard, or how it reached Goya or was lost to the pounding in his ears and the interior squeaks and muffles in his head. The film makes us think how hearing affects sight, and how apprehending things is dependent on all our senses.Everything rests on circumstance, the times of day, the months, the seasons and the weather. For all the research, working with documents in the Prado and other material, La Quinta del Sordo cannot be anything other than impressionistic. It approaches realism, but is constantly thwarted by detail, atmosphere, the volatility of its subject. The camera roves, catching Saturn’s boggling eyes as he gorges on his child. It dwells on gawping mouths, someone shouting in the ear of an old man, a hand holding scissors and an elderly couple eating. The crowds walking out of the city in the festival of San Isidro, Madrid’s patron saint; a couple of men trying to beat each other to death with cudgels. There are people sitting on branches and others floating in the air, all seen fleetingly, incompletely, as the camera goes from face to face, detail to detail, hand to ear, just like a wandering eye, homing in and sliding away.The Black Paintings are filled with apparitions, classical references, with eating and anti-clerical rants, folkloric superstition and memory. Daylight through the window casts the shadows of leaves on the woman in the mantilla. The painting is incomplete and a bit of a ruin, but somehow alive, accompanied by the sound of pigeons and sparrows. Children’s squabbling voices leak in, parents calling, a church bell. Everyday sounds and a subliminal choir, thunder and deep encroaching rumbles at the witches’ sabbath.This could be cheesy, but it isn’t. Parreno’s frequent collaborator, Nicolas Becker, won an Oscar for his sound design for the movie Sound of Metal, about a heavy metal musician losing his hearing. Becker helped Parreno map the acoustics of the Quinta. His aural re-creation of the house is marvellous. We listen on headphones, and sometimes feel pressure in our ears, the roar of circulating blood. This is almost a film about deafness, with its ringing interior noise, as well as the pictorial noise of the paintings themselves.Watching Parreno’s film is like moving around an unfamiliar space with a candle. The dark sometimes assumes a galactic hugeness, lit by pulsing motes and clouds of ochre-ish dust, a flight of insects and light catching the camera lens, like spectral moons, by sparks and hisses, squeaks and squeals, and ominous vague shapes that won’t resolve. We only ever see things incompletely, which is how Goya’s paintings also appear to us now. There’s rain pattering at the window, the shadow of droplets sliding down the pane projected on to the heavy, overpainted emptiness above Goya’s dog. Did its owner once stand there, but was painted out? Afterwards, returning to the Black Paintings, I’m more alert to their every touch, to their silences and indeterminacy and strangeness, their hauntedness.Until 4 September at the Museo Nacional del Prado, Madrid."
All My Friends Hate Me review – dark satire on quarterlife crisis from viral comedy duo,Despite their undoubted comedy talents Tom Palmer and Tom Stourton’s debut feature feels too light on the funny to live up to its potential,2,"Tom Palmer and Tom Stourton made their names as the comedy double-act Totally Tom who went viral some years ago with their (very funny) creation High Renaissance Man, about clueless public schoolboys at uni, but their jointly scripted debut feature film, directed by Andrew Gaynord (from TV’s Stath Lets Flats) is a weirdly unrelaxed dark satire.An entitled thirtysomething called Pete (played by Stourton) has spent some years abroad doing self-congratulatory “gap yah” charity work with refugees, but now wants to reconnect with his old gang from university, one of whom offers to host a huge birthday weekend for Pete at his colossal country estate. There Pete discovers, to his increasing paranoid dismay, that they all now seem to be giggling at him behind his back and that he is the punchline of a massive group joke that he does not understand. These upper-middle class chums of his have also invited a boozy, obnoxious local guy from the village called Harry (Dustin Demri-Burns), whom Pete has never met and doesn’t like, but can’t find a polite way of disinviting.It is an interesting premise, with what could be hints of Peckinpah’s Straw Dogs and Haneke’s Funny Games, and there is mileage in the quarterlife-crisis fear of unpopularity and losing what made you interesting in your teens and 20s. But this struck me as that kind of comedy horror in which (like much romantic comedy) the “comedy” half of the equation has gone missing. The funny stuff which we know that Stourton can do is jettisoned in favour of ordinary straight acting, and the plot’s big reveal feels anticlimactic and undeveloped, relating to what appear to be two separate guilty things in Pete’s past, neither of which has much impact. But I still hope that Stourton and Palmer can yet bring their High Renaissance Man comedy energy to films. All My Friends Hate Me is released on 10 June in cinemas."
Laurel and Hardy review – a dream of slapstick and sadness,"Royal Lyceum, EdinburghStephen McNicoll and Barnaby Power make a consummate team as the comedy legends, delivering knockabout hilarity with a melancholy undertow",4,"Movie director Leo McCarey has a proposal for producer Hal Roach. He has seen Oliver Hardy and Stan Laurel acting in the same silent short, The Lucky Dog, and now he wants to see them as a double act. The film could be called Putting Pants on Philip and the comedians would play to their distinctive characteristics: Hardy as the southern gentleman, Laurel as the wiry Brit. McCarey thinks they’ll be funny together.Not only that, this will be an antidote to the madcap tomfoolery of Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd and the Keystone Cops. His genius idea is for them to play it slow.This is the cue, in the late Tom McGrath’s play, for a piece of choreographed slapstick. The kind of wallpaper sketch we’ve all seen in panto becomes a ballet of ladders, brushes and shovels. Wordlessly, Stan and Ollie run through an extended dance of ducks, dives and crashes. Heads get bashed, ties get slashed and paste gets everywhere. Nearly a century on, the audience guffaws.In this way, McGrath’s play is a paradox; it is a monument to the ephemeral. First seen in 1976, it not only celebrates the comic genius of Stan and Ollie, reprising some of their finest sketches, but also laments the passing of their moment.Written with the fluidity of a dream, it charts the biographical details, from music hall and vaudeville to cinema success, via multiple wives and misguided deals. But rather than a straight tribute, it is a wistful commentary on getting older, a reflection on the impossibility of capturing a fleeting instance of inspiration, laughter and camaraderie.Returning to the parts they last played in 2005, Stephen McNicoll and Barnaby Power are a consummate team. McNicoll, uncannily like Hardy in stature and manner, is all grace, pomposity and flourishes of the tie. Power, always deferential, captures the sleepy eyelids, lolloping gait and endless double takes of a tuft-haired Laurel.Oddly, the theme of ageing is less poignant now that the actors are closer to the ages of the comedians in their heyday. But on a monochrome set by Neil Murray on which even the pies are grey, Tony Cownie’s production remains a bittersweet celebration of the silly and sublime.At the Royal Lyceum, Edinburgh, until 25 June."
Swan Song review – Udo Kier gets on the pantsuit as haughty hairdresser,There are plenty of laughs in this bittersweet drama as a retired stylist makes his way across town to do the hair and makeup of a deceased and disagreeable client,3,"The price of admission, as they say, is justified by the sight of legendary German actor Udo Kier in a Dynasty-era lime-green pantsuit, heels, sunglasses, a rakishly inclined hat and a More cigarette smouldering between his lips. In another of his arrestingly unpredictable career-swerves, Kier now teeters on a knife-edge between throwaway camp humour and sentimental sorrow, playing Pat Pitsenbarger, a character based on a real-life figure from director Todd Stephens’s Ohio home town.Pat is a retired hairdresser, now in a care home; he is recovering from a stroke, still alert, although secretly addicted to his cigarettes and an obsessive habit of folding paper napkins into the kind of small square shape that used to go under highball glasses in the bars where he once hung out. He is visited by a haughty lawyer, Mr Shanrock (Tom Bloom), and Pat’s nurse can’t believe that her patient will wish to see this man: “Shall I tell him you’re dead?” Shanrock tells Pat his late client Mrs Rita Parker Sloan (Linda Evans) – the Republican society hostess whose coiffure was nurtured by Pat every Friday afternoon – has left instructions in her will that Pat should do the hair and makeup work on her corpse before she is buried. So Pat has to reassemble his flamboyant clothing ensemble and sashay across town for this final job, his chef-d’oeuvre, and make his peace with his memories of Rita’s snobbery and homophobia – and also with his hairdressing rival Dee Dee Dale (Jennifer Coolidge), who stole his most famous client.There are plenty of laughs here and Kier doesn’t have to work very hard to get them: he demonstrates a tremendous hauteur in the way Pat asks for various inaccessible items at the local convenience store and then like a Vegas high-roller, while other customers are impatiently lining up behind him, demands various lottery scratchcards: “Hit me!” Like Werner Herzog, Kier’s German accent lends a deadpan drollery to everything he says, but there is a gooey soft-centre to his film, and Kier carries that off reasonably well, his face becoming almost boyish.

Major review – legend of military hero of Mumbai attacks burnished in high style,"A hero of the 2008 hotel siege gets a relentlessly entertaining biopic, going all-out with the hagiographic bells and whistles",3,"As unstintingly jingoistic as it is relentlessly entertaining, this Indian blockbuster celebrates a fictionalised version of the life and – as most of its audience will already know - death of heroic soldier Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan, who was killed fighting terrorists during the 2008 siege at Taj Mahal Palace hotel in Mumbai.Sandeep’s story is already the stuff of legend, so this lavish production goes all-out with all the hagiographic bells and whistles, turning him into a noble, fearless warrior (played by Adivi Sesh, also the film’s screenwriter). Sesh and director Sashi Kiran Tikka turn Sandeep into a very old-school sort of hero: part godlike being, part 1980s-style Hollywood action man, capable of hitting a target with a semi-automatic while sliding for metres on his knees, in slow-motion no less. He also possesses an unswerving moral compass that makes him a natural leader and compels him to honour his duty as a soldier above all else, even if that means neglecting his beautiful architect wife Isha (Saiee Manjrekar, utterly magnetic) and sometimes failing to return calls from his parents (Prakash Raj, Revathi).The first, more fictional part covers Sandeep and Isha’s courtship in some detail, climaxing with a no-cliche-left-unused kiss-in-the-rain declaration of love. That strand of the story is crosscut with lots and lots of montages showing how quickly Sandeep rises up the ranks thanks to his natural proficiency until he becomes a training officer for the elite 51 Special Action Group in the National Security Guards. When the dastardly terrorists attack in Mumbai, he shouldn’t have been among the soldiers who went in to save the hostages and fight back, but he insisted on going. The producers have clearly paid up for the extras, sets and visual effects making this a lavish work, never dull for a second of its ample running time – even if some viewers may find the sentimentality a little hard to digest. Major is released on 3 June in cinemas. This article was amended on 3 June 2022 to remove mention of Bollywood, as the film was produced by India’s Telegu film industry."
The Camera Is Ours review – evocative shorts from pioneering female film-makers,"This compilation of British documentary shorts, dating from the 1930s to the 1960s, comes with content warnings about racism – though the sexism can be just as shocking",4,"Here is a feature-length selection of documentary shorts from Britain’s pioneering women film-makers from the 1930s to the 1960s – a theatrical “touring version” from the Independent Cinema Office, taken from a larger assortment on the BFI’s two-disc DVD release.The directors are very often tackling what were considered – by the male producers, that is – to be the “women’s issues” of the day: motherhood, family, hearth and home. Sometimes these are the explicit themes and sometimes they are a subtext. Two of the films are prefaced with content warnings about racism (though not sexism): a blackface minstrel show in Broadstairs is shown in one film and, in another on obstetric education for working-class women, someone is shown repeating the extraordinary superstition that drinking stout will “give you a black baby” – although, unlike the minstrels, this is clearly signposted in the film itself as bizarre and wrong.Beside the Seaside (1935) by Marion Grierson, sister of John Grierson, is a sprightly, ambient evocation of the prewar seaside holiday, regarded without criticism or irony as a healthy restorative tradition. There’s a little of Jean Vigo’s À Propos de Nice in it. Another Grierson sister, Ruby, directed the drama-doc They Also Serve (1940), a paean to the home-front wives and mothers whose husbands were away in uniform, or perhaps too old for service. Quite a few of these films show, with unintentional poignancy, how stressed and prematurely aged the women had become. That is partly true of Birth-Day (1945), directed by Brigid Cooper and Mary Beales, about how working-class women of Scotland should speak to the soothing and reassuring professionals at the antenatal clinic. And it’s certainly true of Kay Mander’s Homes for the People (1945), a much brisker and less patronising work about the need for proper housing.The selection finishes with the aspirational and slightly baffling Something Nice to Eat (1967), directed by Sarah Erulkar, sponsored by the Gas Board, with input from the Sunday Times magazine, evangelising for an ambitious kind of cooking inspired by the classy French. The film is a bit insufferable once it becomes clear that it is entirely addressed to ladies, and there is a curious section praising the ultra-modern kitchen. The one shown here comes with a lava lamp – great, for those who can afford it. The Camera Is Ours is released on 3 June in cinemas."
Dashcam review – Maga-loving social media monster leads pandemic horror ,Annie Hardy plays a livestream host so toxic that even zombies struggle to deal with her,2,"Nasty, brutish and mercifully short, but occasionally mildly amusing, Dashcam represents another dollop of pandemic-themed shock schlock from writer-director Rob Savage, recently renowned for his lockdown-set horror pic Host. This time around, Savage has exchanged Host’s Zoom-chat framing device for a Discord stream, with comments and emojis scrolling up from the bottom of the screen as a fictional audience reacts to the main content. This will probably need a lot of explaining to viewers in 20 years’ time, but for now it seems very à la mode and down with the kids, as is the blurry gore-soaked violence, smutty material (get ready for lots of jokes about anal insertions) and air of cynicism.The star of the show is Annie Hardy, a social media star apparently playing a version of her IRL self: she is an intentionally abrasive millennial Maga fan, whose usual gig is driving around Los Angeles livestreaming and improvising raps in response to suggestions from her fanbase. Unfortunately, lockdown has thinned the action on the streets, apart from the odd naked cyclist. So Annie flies over to the UK to visit her old friend and former bandmate Stretch (Amar Chadha-Patel), who in the years since he’s seen Annie last has got less amused by her racism and refusal to conform by, for instance, wearing a mask around others. Hardy is a personification of everything that is obnoxious about the American right, but seemingly about as unkillable as a cockroach or Donald Trump’s political career judging by the way she navigates through a zombie apocalypse that starts out of nowhere.Savage melds the conventions of found-footage horror and livestreaming effectively up to a certain point until it just starts to seem like a silly, contrived gag. Shot largely on iPhones, there’s a huge amount of shaky-cam jiggling about that may leave some viewers feeling as if they are on one of the funfair dodgem rides featured in the final act. Others may have already begun to feel nauseous at an earlier point when the closeups of a faeces-smeared anus started up. Either way, it’s not pretty. Dashcam is released on 3 June in cinemas, and on 6 June on digital platforms."
I Am Zlatan review – compelling insight into the making of a football superstar,Jens Sjögren’s sympathetic film avoids the cliched sport movie formula of triumph over adversity by focusing on what happens off the pitch,3,"That’s Zlatan as in Zlatan Ibrahimović, the superstar Swedish striker whose troubled childhood in a tough working-class neighbourhood of Malmö is dramatised here. The cocky underprivileged kid saved from (possibly) a life of crime by football; it sounds like the cheesiest sports movie ever. And yet director Jens Sjögren, more interested in what happens off the pitch, dodges the dull cliches. His sympathetic, realist film is a compelling watch.The film is based on Ibrahimović’s autobiography, co-authored with the Swedish writer David Lagercrantz. Dominic Andersson Bajraktati plays 11-year-old Zlatan, who is disruptive in school and bad-tempered on the pitch. What soon becomes clear is that all this behaviour is the communication of a kid who feels inadequate, alone and often hungry. He’s playing football with middle-class boys who wear the right football boots, their dads cheering from the sidelines. Zlatan’s parents divorced when he was little. His dad, Bosnian caretaker Šefik (Cedomir Glisovic), is a brooder who drinks heavily, and his exhausted mum Jurka (Merima Dizdarevic) is emotionally unavailable; both characters are written with real emotional generosity.Granit Rushiti is Zlatan aged 17 during a crucial moment when he might make the Malmö first team or quit football altogether. Rushiti also plays Zlatan a few years on, in his early 20s, now a promising young striker for Ajax – where racist news reporting refers to him as a “lazy immigrant”. There are some insightful insider-y scenes as his agent negotiates a big-time deal with Juventus.What works best is that I Am Zlatan doesn’t push the triumph-over-adversity sports-movie formula. What keeps Ibrahimović on the straight and narrow? Survival instinct? His passion and God-given talent? The film entertains a darker possibility that he channelled his anger, that football success meant revenge against those who wrote him off. I Am Zlatan is released on 3 June in cinemas and on 20 June on digital platforms."
"Pacifiction review – trouble in paradise, in apocalyptic Tahitian mystery","Benoît Magimel’s French high commissioner confronts the end of his personal Eden in Tahiti, in Albert Serra’s distinctive film",4,"Albert Serra’s bizarre epic is a cheese-dream of French imperial tristesse, political paranoia and an apocalyptic despair. It is a nightmare that moves as slowly and confidently as a somnambulist, and its pace, length, and Serra’s beautiful widescreen panoramic framings – in which conventional drama is almost camouflaged or lost – may divide opinion. I can only say I was captivated by the film and its stealthy evocation of pure evil.Admirers of Serra’s previous movies The Death of Louis XIV and Liberté will know what an uncompromisingly original and startling film-maker he is. That distinctiveness is certainly on display with this new spectacle, but with intriguing new hints of David Lynch and Nicolas Winding Refn. (Refn famously directed Agatha Christie’s Marple on British TV; perhaps Albert Serra will turn out to have done some uncredited work on Death In Paradise.) The setting is Tahiti, part of French Polynesia and thus part of the French republic; its lush coasts and landscapes are evoked with breathtaking flair, yet with something lowering in their beauty, something sinister imposed upon them from above or a haze they have had to generate from below.Benoît Magimel (who seems to be morphing into Gérard Depardieu before our very eyes) is M de Roller, the French high commissioner who strolls around with raffish entitlement in his rumpled white suit, a breezy sleazy fellow who enjoys patronising all ranks of the Tahiti population. He hangs out at the local club owned by Morton, another white expatriate, played by the reliably unsettling Sergi López, and De Roller grinningly ogles the almost naked bar staff and glad-hands all the other seedy officials there. He also loves hanging out with the semi-clad indigenous dancers who perform traditional dances for the tourists and, like a poundshop Paul Gauguin, fancies himself a connoisseur of their traditions. He has also fallen in love with the dancers’ choreographer Shannah (Pahoa Mahagafanau).But De Roller’s mood has become more cynical and dyspeptic as his term of office reaches its end, and he is disconcerted by new developments on the island. There seem to be more and more military personnel around, including a certain admiral (Marc Susini), who, when drunk, tells people at the club about the importance of behaving ruthlessly with one’s “own people” (which constitutionally includes Tahitians) to scare potential enemies. De Roller chairs an excruciatingly difficult meeting with indigenous representatives who demand to know if there is any truth in the rumour that the French government is preparing to resume nuclear testing on the island (which, notoriously, took place in secret from the 60s to the 90s.) De Roller, in a cheerfully evasive style, which reminded me of a certain British politician, tells them what they want to hear, and finishes with what he imagines to be a charming bit of patriotic whimsy: promising that they would be welcome at the new casino being built, where Bastille Day would be duly celebrated every year.But in his heart, De Roller knows that this personal Eden of his is about to become poisoned, and perhaps that poison of political bad faith has always been there. A Portuguese diplomat (Alexandre Melo) arrives on the island, making a fuss about his lost passport, and then temporarily loses consciousness, perhaps drugged; was he secretly investigating the French nuclear project? Either way, Shannah takes it on herself to nurse him, a terrible blow to De Roller’s amour propre. And, are the committee of anti-nuclear protesters, De Roller wonders, being sponsored by France’s nuclear rivals: the Russians, the Americans, the Chinese?As the neurosis and horror roll in like invisible fog, De Roller takes a final tour of his beloved, yet also hated, colonial possession. There are superbly composed scenes: particularly shots of the large crafts that take parties of surfers out to where the rolling breakers come in far from shore and these big lumbering boats take on staggeringly high waves: a truly surreal spectacle. The final scenes show De Roller preparing to leave the inferno in a balletically silent and unearthly sequence. But will he actually leave?Perhaps Pacifiction is flawed, but its waywardness is part of Serra’s authorship: it is an authentic descent into darkness. Pacifiction screened at the Cannes film festival and is released in UK cinemas on 21 April."
Nostalgia review – bittersweet crime yarn also homecoming love-letter to Naples ,"Tremendously shot and terrifically acted, this Neapolitan gangster drama from Mario Martone shatters the rose-tinted spectacles",4,"Mario Martone’s beautifully shot and superbly composed film teeters on the edge of something special. And if it doesn’t quite achieve that, settling in the end for something more generically crime-oriented, it’s still very good. Naples looks wonderful here, although very different from the city that Paolo Sorrentino depicted in The Hand of God. A middle-aged guy comes back to his home town after 40 years away, arriving on a plane from Cairo: this is Felice, played by the craggily expressive Pierfrancesco Favino. A great deal of the film’s opening movement is just Felice walking around, overwhelmed with bittersweet memories that he cannot put into words: the streets, the stores, the churches, the balconies, the kids. (The film uses silent Super 8 flashbacks to make explicit some of what he’s remembering.)Felice makes an emotional visit to his ageing mother, Teresa – a delectably sad portrayal from Aurora Quattrocchi – and is angry to see that she has sold the apartment he grew up in and has moved to a dingy ground-floor flat in what he suspects was a ruinous deal. But mother and son are deeply moved to see each other again and there is a touching scene when Felice takes her tiny naked body in his arms and bathes her.But there is a hidden wound beneath all this. Felice’s boyhood friend Oreste (Tommaso Ragno), with whom he indulged in petty crime back in the day, is now a much-feared dead-eyed local mobster, and clearly has something to do with Felice leaving his beloved Naples in the first place. Don Luigi, the local priest, played by Francesco Di Leva, is a passionate campaigner against Oreste’s murderous gangsterism, and after reacting angrily to Felice’s secular “confession” that he was this notorious figure’s best friend, begins a subtle plan to flush Oreste out. This involves introducing Felice to all his parishioners (thus inciting the gossip that will get back to Oreste) and even encouraging the non-drinking Felice to take a little wine.Nostalgia is tremendously shot, and terrifically acted by Favino. It challenges the idea of “nostalgia” as broadcast in the title: it isn’t simply that nostalgia is delusional, or that the past wasn’t as great as it appears when viewed through rose-tinted spectacles. It is that there is no past and present. Naples then and Naples now are the same – and for Felice his fears and loves never really went away or even changed that much. A strong, deeply felt, valuable movie. Nostalgia screened at the Cannes film festival and is released on 17 February in UK cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema."
"Stars at Noon review – languid tale of sex, lies and intrigue in the Nicaraguan heat",Benny Safdie stands out among a strangely lethargic cast in Claire Denis’ erotic and intimate political drama,3,"A heavy tropical raincloud of sensual languor and political intrigue looms over this interesting if sometimes uncertainly acted movie from director Claire Denis – and incidentally, casting Benny Safdie in a small role is to risk everyone else getting upstaged, and so it proves here.This film touches on her keynote themes of sexuality and colonialism, in its 21st-century manifestation, though maybe the romantic passion and duplicity don’t come across as strongly as they might have done with leads who had a stronger chemistry.Denis has co-adapted the 1986 novel by Denis Johnson, originally set in Nicaragua during the Sandinista revolution of the early 80s but here updated to the Covid period, the pandemic evidently fulfilling the “life-during-wartime” background function, although this is necessarily far less dramatic and explicit and Denis substitutes the eerie emptiness of the streets as a kind of military curfew. It is certainly more intimate than a film like The Year of Living Dangerously (1982), often more resembling an erotic hotel-room chamber piece.Margaret Qualley plays Trish, who has come to the capital, Managua, as a freelance journalist but infuriates her sometime editor back in the US (a nice Zoom cameo for John C Reilly) by being utterly useless and unreliable. She is unable to get any lifestyle/travel articles off the ground and a rash political piece criticising corruption has earned her the loathing of the authorities. Now she is reduced to hanging around luxury hotel bars, selling sex for US dollars. She is also having a sordid affair with a local cop (Nick Romano) in return for her continued press corps privileges and with an ageing government official who has offered help.Trish meets a mysterious, handsome Englishman in the bar one evening. Daniel (Joe Alwyn) claims to be in the energy business and engages her services for the evening. Trish later sees Daniel in the company of a certain local who has told Daniel he needs his professional help. But Trish – wily and streetsmart in ways that Daniel isn’t – tells Daniel this man is clearly a Costa Rican cop working for a government agency making common cause with the CIA against what Uncle Sam sees as an unhelpful nation state. Soon, this man is after Daniel’s head. Daniel, too, is not what he seems and as their danger increases, Trish and Daniel embark on a passionate affair.It is reasonably acted, although the cool, enigmatic sophistication required of Alwyn brings him worryingly close to Roger Moore territory. Qualley nicely conveys neediness, alcoholism and self-reproach although her performance, like Alwyn’s, sometimes feels a bit callow. They are outclassed by Safdie as the mysterious US expat who befriends Trisha.What works better is the ambient mood of torpor, cynicism and bad faith in the insupportable heat – all shrewdly conjured by Denis. Stars at Noon screened at the Cannes film festival and is released on 19 June in the UK on digital platforms."
"Leila’s Brothers review – one woman, five misogynistic parasites in fierce Iranian drama","Iran’s Saeed Roustayi puts the spotlight on a woman driven to distraction by the indolent, incompetent patriarchy",4,"Iranian film-maker Saeed Roustayi delivers a big, absorbing, character-driven family drama in the Italian-American style with fierce performances, a huge set-piece wedding scene and touches of Visconti’s Rocco and His Brothers and Coppola’s The Godfather. There’s even some Arthur Miller amid the angry, painful recrimination.We get a blistering turn from Taraneh Alidoosti – known for her work on movies by Asghar Farhadi – playing the Leila of the title: a woman driven to distraction by the indolent, incompetent patriarchy. Leila lives with her elderly parents; she is plagued with periodic back pain brought on by stress and overwork and is basically the only regular wage-earner, single-handedly supporting four adult brothers.Overweight Parviz (Farhad Aslani) works as a toilet cleaner in the mall, but does not make enough to feed his family, which grows as he tries repeatedly for a boy. Musclebound lunk Farhad (Mohammad Ali Mohammadi) is interested only in US wrestling on TV. Bone-idle Manouchehr (Payman Maadi) is looking for dodgy get-rich-quick schemes, not work. And Alireza (Navid Mohammadzadeh) recently quit a factory job whose bosses weren’t coming through with the wages.At the head of all these useless, parasitical males is their ageing father, Esmail (Saeed Poursamimi) – a whining, self-pitying schemer, addicted to opium, and obsessed with becoming “patriarch” of his extended clan, a position that has fallen vacant with his cousin’s death. The cousin’s son Bayram (Mehdi Hosseinina) tells him the patriarch’s metaphorical crown could be his – as long as he pays 40 gold coins as a marriage present “tribute” at Bayram’s son’s forthcoming wedding. Greedy, foolish Esmail agrees – because he has the coins and knows that the patriarch’s unofficial perk is taking a secret “cut” from any and all marriage gifts at future weddings.Meanwhile, Leila has latched on to an imaginative plan which could yet make the family an honest income: they could take the lease on one of the new retail units being built at the mall, symbolically on the site of Parviz’s public lavatory. But she can only get the bank loan with a deposit – she needs cash – and is enraged to learn that the old man’s stash of gold coins is going to be squandered in this fatuous, dishonest way. But can he be stopped?Leila lives in a world of male crooks who never cease congratulating themselves on their status and prestige, yet are averse to anything resembling work and entirely content to leech off the women, rewarding them with misogyny and condescension. The cynical crook Manouchehr had suggested to his brothers a business meeting with a pal – Leila was naturally excluded from the meeting, as a woman. This opportunity turned out to be merely a scam to lease nonexistent cars, similar in its underhandedness to the patriarch’s “wedding gift” trick. And as with that trick, it is extremely likely that the person letting you in on the secret is making you the biggest victim.Leila’s simmering rage at the contemptible mediocrity of her father and brothers, and the exhaustion of trying to save them from themselves, is the emotional energy that powers the movie, building to that climactic wedding scene. It is a great performance from Alidoosti, first among equals in a great ensemble cast. Leila’s Brothers screened at the Cannes film festival."
Jerry Lee Lewis: Trouble in Mind review – Ethan Coen’s amazing tribute to the Killer,"The Coen brother goes solo to put together a documentary about the shamanic wild man of early rock’n’roll, who reinvented himself as a country and gospel act",4,"The Coen brothers temporarily parted ways for solo projects on haunted charismatic wrongdoers: for Joel it was Macbeth, for Ethan it has turned about to be insurgent rock’n’roll legend Jerry Lee Lewis, the shuddering, quivering Pentecostal shaman of the devil’s music, who is still alive at the age of 86.Coen has put together a thoroughly enjoyable documentary composed entirely of archive footage of Jerry Lee throughout the years and his interviews and performances, starting with his sensational beginnings in the 1950s, leading to his cancellation in 1957 on the grounds of getting married – of all the sweetly old-fashioned things – to his 13-year-old cousin Myra Gale Brown. With cheerful impenitence, Jerry Lee is shown correcting an interviewer: Myra was one day shy of her 13th birthday on their wedding day so she was actually twelve.Long years in the touring wilderness followed, doggedly tending to his US fanbase coast-to-coast, before Jerry Lee cunningly and successfully reinvented himself as a country singer, and an extravagantly sincere gospel performer: personalities which co-existed with multiple marriages and drink and drug abuse issues.In the amazing 50s footage Jerry Lee looks like the most terrifying Batman villain: the Riddler, perhaps, with his unfurled ringlets of blond hair that flew back from his head as he clattered the notes with those straight, splayed fingers for Whole Lotta Shakin’ Goin’ On, kicked the stool back and crashed a dissonant heel down on the keyboard. In his later, country incarnation in the 70s with more measured style and subdued hair, Jerry Lee is shown performing Whole Lotta Shakin’ again, and it sounds even more predatory. No one made the line “we got chicken in the barn” sound more horribly unwholesome. He would still periodically go into the weird marionette playing style, bending his forearms up at the elbow, alternating to bring his fists down.Like Elvis and all white rock’n’roll legends, Jerry Lee had an unpayable debt to black music and great black performers like Little Richard; Coen doesn’t mention it, but there’s also an obvious link between Jerry Lee and Liberace, the same weirdly coy up-through-the-lashes glance at the audience that’s created when you look at them from the keyboard. Elvis’s instruments were the mic stand and the guitar, which lend themselves more directly to pelvis-gyrating sexiness. With the piano it’s different - you have to launch yourself crazily away from it, as if moved by the spirit.Jerry Lee always looked like a carnival barker and a televangelist - much more so than his cousin Jimmy Swaggart, who actually was a televangelist. He looks completely different for a BBC TV interview he gave to my colleague Richard Williams on The Old Grey Whistle Test: Jerry Lee had a beard, because he was preparing to play Jesus in a planned movie called The Carpenter. Sadly, I can find no record of that film ever getting made - what a remarkable performance Jerry Lee would surely have given. There is also a fascinating audio recording of a conversation Jerry Lee had with Sun Records founder Sam Phillips, in which confessed his agonising fears about the state of his immortal soul.This documentary does something very few films can: it makes you grin with pleasure. Jerry Lee Lewis: Trouble in Mind screened at the Cannes film festival."
Forever Young review - endlessly tedious story of self-involved drama students,Valerie Bruni-Tedeschi’s latest Cannes lock-in is a woeful soap about aspiring actors in 80s Paris with neither the songs – or the soul – of Alan Parker’s Fame,2,"Endless drama, perpetual pouting and nonstop narcissism in this epically tiresome movie from director Valerie Bruni-Tedeschi and screenwriter Agnes De Sacy about a generation of highly-strung and mercurially talented young drama students in the 1980s who are admitted to the prestigious acting school at Patrice Chéreau’s Theatre Des Amandiers in Nanterre.Among the ranks of yearning and deeply serious hopefuls, Stella (Nadia Tereszkiewicz) is a passionate blonde star who is sort of embarrassed about the hugely wealthy home she comes from; Adèle (Clara Bretheau) is the rebellious, wacky figure who doesn’t wear knickers at the audition; Victor (Vassily Schneider) is a sweet-natured, klutzy boy; Étienne (Sofiane Bennacer) is the smack-addicted guy who starts going out with Stella, and his moody image and habit of shouting “Stella!” earn him the nickname Marlon Brando — the film’s one genuinely humorous moment.The drama teacher Pierre Romans is played by Micha Lescot, and the legendary Chéreau is played with much smouldering imperious charisma by Louis Garrel.This is a strange, overwrought setup, though perhaps quite accurately drawn, in which the students are in a permanent state of emotional meltdown. Étienne introduces his teacher Pierre to smack and the supposed authority figure gets completely out of it in the middle of a rehearsal. As for Chéreau himself, he is a huge cocaine enthusiast, and is shown snorting a massive line in the middle of the working day. The fact that all these students are sleeping with each other means that news of an HIV positive diagnosis creates a great spasm of shrieking anxiety and three of them are shown cramming into a single phone box to get the news of an Aids test. But this whole subject is treated with far less seriousness than a movie like, say, Robin Campillo’s 120 BPM and these young people don’t really appear to care about anything or anyone other than themselves.With a subject like this, the shadow of Alan Parker’s Fame is never far away, and it is maybe too easy to mock. But what is exasperating about the film is its reluctance to dramatise the teaching: to show the young people themselves simply getting better at acting. They are doing a performance of Chekhov’s Platonov, one of whose themes is the fragility and impermanence of youth. But their relationship to Chekhov is not taken seriously: the play simply provides incidental scenes and a backdrop to the silly, soap-operatic uproar."
Cop Secret review – unsubtle Icelandic police comedy,Two rival cops are paired up with not quite unforeseen results,2,"In this rowdy cop-movie pastiche from Iceland, a hot shot detective is partnered with his arch rival, only to find that their mutual animosity is a mask for deeper feelings. A heady mix of muscle cars, bank robberies, shootouts and macho posturing is juxtaposed with a polite Icelandic backdrop and a touching (if not entirely persuasive) gay love story.Cop Secret is a broadly comic feature debut from Hannes Þór Halldórsson (who in a previous life was goalkeeper in the Icelandic national football team), but one that is too exhaustingly blunt to be as funny as it clearly believes itself to be.

"a-ha: The Movie review – Norway’s 80s pop pinups in dour, exacting details",The trio recount their formative years – and their fallouts – in this slightly dispiriting documentary,2,"There has been a wealth of exceptional music documentaries lately – the kind of films that are strong enough to connect with both fans and audiences who are indifferent to the music of their subjects. Unfortunately, a-ha: The Movie is not one of these. The story of the unfathomably pretty 80s Norwegian pop trio is recounted in dour, exacting detail by three men who make no secret of how little love is lost between them. The iconic animated video for Take On Me is referenced – one of the more appealing aspects of the film is the way it also uses animation to illustrate tales of the bandmates’ early lives.Fans will no doubt find the film fascinating, if a little dispiriting: it may be like eavesdropping on your parents, only to discover that they’re on the brink of divorce."
The Innocents review – icily brilliant tale of kids with supernatural powers is future classic,"Young actors steal the show in this scary movie set on a Norwegian housing estate, where grownups are unaware of the children’s abilities",5,"A Norwegian housing estate becomes the village of the damned in this icily brilliant supernatural tale from film-maker Eskil Vogt, who as a screenwriter is known for his collaborations with Joachim Trier; rather amazingly, his movie before this brutal chiller was their co-scripted romantic comedy The Worst Person in the World. As for The Innocents, it might yet become a scary-movie classic: it greased my palms with anxiety and incidentally has some of the best child acting I have ever seen. See it now before Hollywood comes along and messes up your perception with a dodgy remake. (Having said which, Steven Spielberg or Brian De Palma might well have been interested in this script in their younger days, or maybe even now.)Vogt places us in a pleasant, if featureless residential development in Romsås, Oslo, with 60s-style high-rise buildings near an artificial lake and picturesque woodland. Ida (played by newcomer Rakel Lenora Fløttum) is a moody nine-year-old who resents her mum and dad paying so much attention to her elder sister Anna (Alva Brynsmo Ramstad), who is autistic. As the long hot summer drags on, Ida is left to play outside, and tasked with looking after Anna. But Ida leaves her sister alone on the swings one day while she goes off with a new friend: a boy called Ben (Sam Ashraf) who shows her a strange mental trick he can do, making a bottle cap fly through the air without touching it. He also has a nasty predilection for torturing animals.Meanwhile, Anna strikes up a friendship with a girl called Aisha (Mina Yasmin Bremseth Asheim), who has telepathic powers to match Ben’s telekinesis. Aisha starts silently communicating in her mind with Anna, who – to her parents’ overjoyed astonishment – is now able to speak, thanks to her new friend. But these superpowers, revealed as calmly and frankly as if in some social-realist drama, become forces for evil.There is something compelling and even shocking about Ida’s first reaction to Ben’s bottle-cap trick: her sudden, fierce grin of pleasure and excitement. It is almost unearthly. These children are not innocent, and yet there is something pristine in their seclusion from adulthood; like the children in this film’s namesake from 1961, based on Henry James’s ghost story The Turn of the Screw, their world is a secret from the grownups. I also found myself thinking of English TV dramatist Dennis Potter.With a story such as this, it is tempting to find it legible only as metaphor: to decide that Ida, Anna, Ben and Aisha’s existence is a parable for abuse, family dysfunction or racism (it is the two young people of colour who have the powers, at least initially.) Vogt’s script for Trier’s 2017 film Thelma, with its telekinesis theme, is obviously amenable to metaphorical readings. But perhaps this film’s force comes from the fact that there is no other level to find in it. They simply have these supernatural abilities, it is something to do with their being children, and that is all there is to it. The final “duel” scene, taking place in almost complete silence and under the nose of the notionally competent adults, is a masterpiece of sorts. The Innocents is a nightmare unfolding in cold, clear daylight. The Innocents is released on 20 May in cinemas and on digital platforms."
a-ha: The Movie review – Take on Me hitmakers relive the highs and the lows,An air of self-loathing and regret hangs over this 40th-anniversary documentary about the Norwegian trio who shot to fame in the 80s,3,"It’s got to be one of the worst jobs in showbiz: being a-ha’s official photographer. Here’s the poor guy after a particularly awkward, everyone-gritting-their-teeth photo shoot: “It’s very hard as a photographer when people don’t want to be together. It shows.” And it really does show. Watching this 40th-anniversary documentary, you might conclude that what a-ha really need is a band therapist, not a photographer.Four years in the making, a-ha: The Movie is the comprehensive story of the Norwegian trio (about 20 minutes too comprehensive for all but diehard fans). To anyone over 45, no introductions are necessary: a-ha is the band whose single Take on Me reached No 2 in the UK charts back in 1985 (it’s still a knockout pop tune with the crack-cocaine of riffs). Back then, the band’s singer Morten Harket smouldered like a sensitive misunderstood bad boy. Now he looks like the dishy doctor from a daytime soap, still impossibly chiselled. Like all the band, Harket has got his personal demons: he’s a perfectionist who instantly reaches for the hand sanitiser after meeting fans (this was filmed pre-Covid, apparently). Keyboardist Magne Furuholmen still resents being booted off guitar back in the 80s. Guitarist Pål Waaktaar-Savoy is a controlling presence.The history that emerges here is of a band yo-yoing between attempts to be taken seriously as artists, then coming back for more boyband fame and adulation. An air of collective self-loathing and regret hangs over them. Of course, it’s impossible to feel that sorry for three wealthy men in middle age swanning around the world on sold-out tours wearing leather jackets that cost the price of a second-hand car. Waaktaar-Savoy’s wife puts it best when she says it’s a shame they can’t enjoy it more. “It’s sinful not to appreciate what you have when you have so much.” a-ha: The Movie is released on 20 May in cinemas."
"Final Cut (Coupez!) review – Hazanavicius’s silly, splattery zombie horror meta-farce","The Artist director’s remake of the Japanese cult film One Cut of the Dead is an undemanding, easygoing way to kick off the Cannes film festival",3,"Let’s do the wacky metafictional zombie film right here! That is the rationale behind this unassuming knockabout comedy-farce - in which more or less everyone gets splattered with blood and bodily fluids - from Michel Hazanavicius, chosen to open this year’s Cannes film festival, and so starting things off with some easygoing laughs. (A very bizarre experience, considering that audiences at the opening gala had just watched a live video-link address from Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Zelenskiy, however, is a comedy veteran in his former TV showbusiness career - and might well approve.)This is in fact a remake of the cult Japanese movie One Cut of the Dead by Shin’ichirô Ueda, from 2017, and this remake is itself therefore about a remake, thus adding another metafictional level to the proceedings. The result is something appreciably sillier and more eccentric than the original, with some gags about patronising and stereotypical European attitudes to the Japanese which make it broader still, and sometimes it’s a tiny bit self-conscious in unintentional ways. It’s certainly far from the sophistication and gloss for which Hazanavicius became famous ten years ago with his silent pastiche The Artist; it’s closer to his spy spoof series OSS 117. But it’s likeable and goofy.Just as with the original film, it’s impossible not to think about the classic Michael Frayn meta-farce for the stage, Noises Off, showing in its first act a cheesy and chaotic rep play, then the backstage action in real-time explaining that the disasters we just witnessed. At first, the film appears to be about the making of a low-budget French zombie movie, which is interrupted by real zombies, brought back from the dead because the film crew has infringed an ancient local taboo. These real zombies delight the screamingly dictatorial director (Romain Duris) who wants authentic horror to galvanise his torpid cast. But his crew are horrified, particularly his assistant (Bérénice Bejo). But wait. Why do these French people have Japanese names? Why is the acting so strange, and what’s with the final wobbly crane shot?The answer is that this is supposed to be a continuous single-take movie lasting just 30 minutes, being filmed on the lowest budget imaginable: any mistakes, and they can’t just go back to first positions. They just have to improv it out. And once the curtain is lowered in this curious spectacle, flashbacks show us the bizarre compromises and negotiations that led up to this highly unlikely situation.It’s an entertaining piece of work - and a genuine oddity, ostensibly about cinema, but more about the live theatre experience. It may yet have found a way to breathe new life into the zombie genre itself. Final Cut screened at the Cannes film festival and is released in the UK on 7 November on digital platforms."
Mariner of the Mountains review – dreamily wonderful Algerian odyssey,Karim Aïnouz’s essay on his own family history takes him from Brazil to north Africa to discover his father’s country,4,"Karim Aïnouz, best known for mostly Brazil-set dramatic features such as Invisible Life, Love for Sale and the evocatively titled I Travel Because I Have to, I Come Back Because I Love You, is truly an international film-maker. The son of a Brazilian mother and an Algerian father, he lives sometimes in Berlin and sometimes in the US, depending on his latest project. (His next film, Firebrand, will star Alicia Vikander as Henry VIII’s last wife Katherine Parr.)Mariner of the Mountains, which premiered last year at Cannes, goes back to basics technically and Aïnouz’s own family history to create a thoughtful, often moving essay film about his journey to Algeria, the fatherland he never knew. Narrated throughout in Portuguese by the silky-voiced director, the film comprises a sort of filial love letter to his recently deceased mother, Iracema, who brought him up in Fortaleza, northern Brazil, with his grandmother after she was separated from her husband, Majid, Karim’s Algerian father. Majid went to Algeria to fight in the civil war, leaving his wife pregnant back in the Americas.In the film, Aïnouz meets disaffected youth smoking blunts by the waterside, kindly old folk who offer him coffee and oral history, a bright teenage cousin who reels off local creation myths, and an especially beautiful goat with curly wurly horns. The imagery mixes the scenic footage Aïnouz shot himself along the way, intermingled with old Super 8 footage of Iracema as a young woman, archive footage and bewitching microscope views of the single-celled sea creatures the director’s mother studied as a scientist.Adding the film’s dreamy vibe is the editing by Ricardo Saraiva, which repeatedly builds up an atmosphere in a montage with some lovely music bedded under it only to abruptly cut, killing the buzz each time. It’s as if the film wants to keep pulling the rug out from under us, just when we might be thinking we’re in for a bit of brainy cinematic tourism. But Aïnouz is no sentimentalist; his essay invokes not just the mysteries of his parents’ marriage but the country’s postcolonial history and anguished present, a subject that he explored further in Nardjes A, a companion piece to this that he shot concurrently and follows a local activist fighting for democracy. Mariner of the Mountains is on Mubi from 23 May."
The Essex Serpent review – Claire Danes is magnificent … unlike Tom Hiddleston,The Loki actor feels too suave to play a humble vicar in this adaptation of Sarah Parry’s lush novel – which makes the central romance cold and condescending,3,"Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, said Freud. But darlings, let me tell you – a snake is never just a snake. And certainly not in The Essex Serpent (Apple TV+), the new six part miniseries adapted by Anna Symon from Sarah Perry’s 2016 bestselling novel of the same name.At the tail end of the Victorian era and recently liberated by her wealthy, abusive husband’s death from cancer, young widow Cora Seaborne (Claire Danes) abandons London society and moves to Aldwinter on the edge of the Blackwater marshes to pursue a much more fulfilling life as an amateur paleontologist in comfortable clothes. With her she takes her devoted maidservant Martha (Hayley Squires) and her autistic (in modern day terms) son Frankie. Her husband’s former doctor, Luke Garrett (Frank Dillane), becomes a friend – and, in time, a contender at least in his eyes for her affections – and visits often.When sightings of the legendary monster of the marshes begin, Cora theorises that it may be a living fossil – an icthyosaur-like being that escaped evolutionary pressures in the ancient wetlands – while the locals cleave to superstition and supernatural explanations for what they call “the Blackwater Beast”. Between the two stands the Rev Will Ransome (Tom Hiddleston), a man of God but also of the Enlightenment, keen to keep the growing fears and fancies of his flock under control and not call on divine or diabolic explanation unless all others have been exhausted. In this, he is not helped by his curate Matthew, a fire and brimstone type (whose name is surely meant to evoke the Witchfinder General Matthew Hopkins, who began his career in Essex in the 17th century) who sees the serpent as a sign from God that urgent repentance of the villagers’ sins is needed.As the friendship between Will, his ailing wife Stella (Clémence Poesy) and Cora grows, so does the attraction between Will and Cora – rather less convincingly on screen than in the book. Perhaps this is down to a lack of chemistry between the leads, or perhaps the miscasting of Hiddleston, who never manages to shed his innate air of suave confidence. It works well when playing a god of mischief amidst a plethora of equally towering egos in the Marvel Cinematic Universe; less so when playing a Victorian vicar humble enough to admit doubts and wrestle with his conscience. Let alone fall in love with a woman cleverer than him, and spend time offering explanations that he is too honest to dismiss out of hand, however much they pain him. It gives his exchanges with Cora a condescending edge that is the death knell to the love and profound yearning that animated their relationship in the novel.Danes, on the other hand, is magnificent as Cora – brusque, athletic, undisguisably intelligent and every inch a woman gradually being restored to life and self in the wake of her husband’s brutality. In fact, all the women are wonderful, from Squires, who brings vitality and conviction to what could be the slightly worthy part of the Socialist servant eager to bring about change, via Lily-Rose Aslandogdu and Dixie Egerickx as guilt-stricken youngsters who fear they summoned the beast, to Poesy who – as gentle, watchful Stella, is a heartbroken and heartbreaking revelation.For all that, there is something strangely cold and sluggish about the adaptation of Perry’s book, which despite being a novel of ideas, was lush and vibrant, too. Although it excavated the links between myth, science and religion, it held up love in all its forms to the light as well. Platonic love, sexual love, requited and unrequited romantic love, love of a child, of a vocation, of discovery, of God. It was Wuthering Heights pulled into shape and given intellectual rigour without losing any of its sweeping gothic passion. But on screen, abundance has become austerity, suppressed feeling shades into inertia and the protagonists keep treading and retreading the same small patch of argumentative ground instead of sparking off each other and forging the greater and greater bond on which the story should turn.Maybe I am simply too much a fan of the book. Symon’s take works perfectly well as a drama that delivers suitably sinuous twists and, under Clio Barnard’s direction, looks grimly fabulous, emerging out of the marsh mists that seem to promise that any malevolence is possible. And Danes grounds and gives a remarkable truth to the whole. But even allowing for the fact that screen adaptations rarely capture the full filigree of a literary novelist’s work (one reason why uncomplicated genre fiction generally fares better – there is more to add, less to lose), it feels like slightly too much has been lost in translation here."
"Top Gun: Maverick review – Tom Cruise is still speedy, less needy in a rock’n’roll sequel",Cruise presides over some surprising differences from his first outing as the navy pilot hotshot in a film that’s missing the homoerotic tensions of the 80s original,3,"In the first Top Gun in 1986 – that anti-Strangelove cold war classic – the US Navy’s fighter pilot Lt Pete “Maverick” Mitchell gets accused of letting his ego write cheques his body can’t cash. But with the sequel, it’s quite clear the body of Maverick, played by Tom Cruise, has been cashing cheques with abandon for decades. His pecs have been setting up standing orders. His biceps have been signing off on direct debits. His abs have been authorising BACS transfers and his rock-hard buttocks each have their own PayPal account. In short, as we return to the extraordinary story of Pete Mitchell, it’s plain that he’s still physically solvent, in the opening scene recklessly test-flying a colossal stealth fighter at Mach 10 against orders from the glowering officer on the ground (played by Ed Harris), who is forced to concede that he’s “got balls”. (They’re both configured for contactless payment.)Almost 40 years on from the first film, which was directed by Tony Scott, Maverick is still speedy, less needy – more centred and calmer, in fact, but still in humungous shape and in love with flying. Directing duties are taken over by Joseph Kosinski, known for his digital effects and sci-fi, and the script is by Ehren Kruger, Eric Warren Singer and longtime Cruise collaborator Christopher McQuarrie. In 2022, Maverick is still only a captain, when he could have been an admiral by now. Despite his badass attitude, he’s respected by the real flyers and loathed by the pointy-headed brass, and is protected by his enduring bromance with former classmate and rival Iceman, who is now an admiral. Val Kilmer gamely contributes a cameo.The inevitable crisis is a double-header. The Navy must get an elite team of pilots to carry out a Dam Busters-style raid on an anonymously-located nuclear enrichment plant. Commanding officer Cyclone (Jon Hamm) has the ticklish diplomatic task of telling Maverick to train this new generation of adorable hotheads without joining them in the skies himself. What’s even trickier is that the new intake includes Bradley “Rooster” Bradshaw (Miles Teller), son of Goose, played by Anthony Edwards in the first movie: Maverick’s wingman and buddy, for whose fate many (including Rooster) still blame Maverick. But you can’t stay mad at Maverick, or keep him on the ground, for long.There’s plenty of rock’n’roll fighter-pilot action in this movie, but weirdly none of the homoerotic tension that back in the day had guys queueing up at the Navy recruitment booths set up in cinema foyers. Weirder still, it is actually less progressive on gender issues than the original film, which did after all put a woman in charge: astrophysicist Charlotte Blackwood, played by Kelly McGillis, was the trainer (inspired by real-life Pentagon official Christine Fox). Now it’s Maverick in charge and there is just the one female pilot under his instruction: Phoenix, a thin role for Monica Barbaro. McGillis has evidently not been invited back and her character is never mentioned. The unmarried Maverick’s love interest this time around is a nice woman who runs the local bar, an entirely thankless part for Jennifer Connelly.But where, oh where, is the towel-round-the-waist, semi-nude locker-room intensity between the guys? The guys who compete with each other but need each other? Well, nowhere. The confrontations happen in more wholesome, open conditions: in Connelly’s bar, mostly, and a healthy good-natured game of beach football for team-building. Teller has to be a tough guy, so his late father Goose is remembered by this film as more of an alpha than he actually was: in fact, Goose was a nerdier and more retiring type, closer to this film’s bespectacled comedy turn Bob (Lewis Pullman). Glen Powell plays an arrogant young pilot, call-sign Hangman, who has the burden of incarnating the big-headedness of both the younger Iceman and the younger Maverick.Cruise’s movie-star chops are still miraculous though, and he has a genuinely touching dialogue scene with Kilmer. Now I want to see him take on a sequel to Risky Business and do the underpants dance again. Top Gun: Maverick screens at the Cannes film festival and is released on 26 May in Australia, and on 27 May in the US and UK."
Vortex review – Gaspar Noé’s stunning split-screen descent into dementia,"A retired psychiatrist suffers a stroke, while her film-maker husband potters about their Paris apartment in denial in this brutally insightful film",5,"Gaspar Noé brings his cauterisingly fierce gaze to the spectacle of old age: the world of those about to enter the void. He brings to it a particular structural insight which I don’t think I have ever seen represented so clearly. Dying is bifurcated: a real-time split-screen experience divided between the carer and the cared-for. An old married couple, people who have had a lifetime to wonder which of them will die first and which of them will have to take up the burden of care, find that it is not so clear during the terrible endgame itself.Veteran director Dario Argento and actor, screenwriter and director Françoise Lebrun play a couple who live together in a small, chaotic Parisian apartment covered in an amiable clutter of books and papers. He is evidently a film-maker or maybe a writer, working on a book about cinema and dreams entitled Psyche; she is a retired psychiatrist. They have a son, Stéphane (Alex Lutz) who is himself the father of a small boy, and burdened with drug issues and money and marital worries. The movie opens – ominously – with a video clip of Françoise Hardy performing the 60s chanson Mon Amie la Rose, about the mortality of flowers. Then Argento and Lebrun enjoy a modest meal on their rickety terrace: these are Lebrun’s final moments of lucidity. We learn that she suffered a stroke a few years ago and has been descending into dementia since then; recently the rate of decline has accelerated.Noé splits the screen into two, dual stories running concurrently, showing in one half Argento’s character pottering thoughtfully about the flat, in denial about what is happening: reading, snoozing, clattering away at his manual typewriter and also leaving surreptitious phone messages, like a lovelorn teenager, for a woman called Claire with whom he has been miserably in love for decades. Meanwhile, on the left-hand side of the screen, Lebrun’s character, with the impassive, leonine expression of dementia patients, wanders off into the streets without telling her husband, or throws all his notes away, or dangerously leaves the gas on, all in a miserable haze of unknowing.Stéphane comes around to see them, deeply upset by what is happening, and by his own inability to persuade them to enter a care home; this is a subject complicated by his own history with his psychiatrist mother, stricken by the fact that he and they now live in a world of drugs, legal and illegal. Noé will periodically contrive a camera-cut in either of the frames and resume from another point of view; occasionally the two scenes will overlap creating a Hockneyesque perspective-dissonance. Brutally, the medium is the message. These two people will never again share the same screen.This is a movie without the pornographic and psychedelic sheen of Noé’s previous work, but those earlier pictures had a recurring trick: forcing audiences to the edge of nausea by making them stare into a vortex of flickering stroboscopic light. In this movie, death is the vortex: the dark focus, whose gravitational pull gets stronger – and harder to avoid thinking about – with every passing year. And Vortex tells us something else about old age, something which a severe and high-minded movie like Michael Haneke’s Amour would not grasp: death is chaotic, like life. It ends with things undone and in messy disarray. This is a work of wintry maturity, and real compassion. Vortex is released on 13 May in cinemas."
Father Stu review – renegade-turned-priest Mark Wahlberg blesses Catholic drama,Mark Wahlberg stars in a based on truth story ably supported by Jacki Weaver –though Mel Gibson is a much less welcome presence,2,"In this de facto, if far from de jure, latest iteration of the Ted franchise, Mark Wahlberg once again forms a strange, almost inexplicable bond with a supernatural creature who tests him in a number of painful, problematic ways. However – surprise! – instead of a stuffed teddy bear that’s come to life, this time the agent of chaos is God himself, that omnipresent, omniscient, all-powerful scamp. God first makes the life of Wahlberg’s Stuart Long hard by taking away his little brother via a sudden death when they are little kids, and then giving him a nature that gets him into trouble throughout his life, keeping him from finding a vocation until he finally Finds a Vocation, ie the desire to become a priest.On the plus side, Stu at least has a number of nice people rooting for him and helping him out, including his feisty mom Kathleen (Jacki Weaver). There’s also a saintly girlfriend named Carmen (Teresa Ruiz) who first leads him to the church, and variously supportive fellow seminary students (Aaron Moten and Cody Fern) who, like most of the supporting cast, deserve canonisation for offering very strong performances as unexpectedly well defined characters. And I am loth to admit this but that also goes for Mel Gibson; if you can separate the dancer from dance, he is an actor capable of bringing a face like a long stretch of ravaged road and a credible impression of pain to the role of Stu’s alcoholic dad Billy. Still, Gibson’s connections to a particularly retrograde, Opus Dei-adjacent branch of the Catholic church represents a problem for a movie that wants us to celebrate the faith’s ability to be more inclusive and accepting of renegades. Is this really what Jesus would have wanted?There is a nice soundtrack by Dickon Hinchliffe, sometime Tinderstick and composer of several great soundtracks for directors such as Claire Denis, Debra Granik and Maggie Gyllenhaal. What he’s doing working with the likes of Gibson is puzzling but we all have our crosses to bear. There are also good bits in this based-on-a-true-story drama, including the aforementioned performances and a commitment to theology so sincere it’s not afraid to bore an audience with lots of pin-head-fine debates about Godhood. If Gibson weren’t part of the package it might be possible to like it more. Father Stu is released on 13 May in cinemas."
Wild Men review – Danish dad seeks his inner Viking in midlife crisis comedy,"A suburban man leaves his family and heads to the mountains, where he meets a criminal on the run…",4,"Draped in deerskins, armed with a roughly hewn axe and a bow, Martin (Rasmus Bjerg) is at one with the land. He appreciatively sniffs a handful of what looks suspiciously like faeces, scans the undergrowth, before looming over his prey. He is, in his mind at least, a mighty hunter. The score, an urgent, muscular battle cry on sawing double bass, agrees with him. But his prey is a small frog, and Martin’s attempts to live on the land are doomed by the fact that he is an ordinary suburban father of two in the throes of the mother of all midlife crises.Martin’s adventure in the mountains of Norway takes a new direction when he teams up with Musa (Zaki Youssef), an injured criminal on the run from the cops and his former partners. Martin also finds himself on the wrong side of the law after a botched attempt at bartering, followed by a raid on a Viking village (he steals a catering pack of bread rolls).What makes this amiably amusing Danish comedy work is the fact that it takes its hapless protagonist almost as seriously as he takes himself. And while Martin’s tragicomic plight is the central focus, director Thomas Daneskov and co-writer Morten Pape take an unusual degree of care with the fleshed-out supporting characters, particularly Martin’s longsuffering wife, Anne (The Killing’s Sofie Gråbøl), who wrangles two emotional children and a husband who would rather live on lichen than deal with his marital issues."
Barry & Joan review – all-singing all-dancing vaudevillians get their moment in the sun,"Nostalgic insight into the theatrical world of the Granthams, an eccentric couple from the golden era of entertainment",3,"This tender tribute to dancing/mime/commedia dell’arte masters Barry and Joan Grantham is as sweet and nostalgic as elderflower cordial. Married for donkey’s years, the couple are somewhere in their 80s or 90s. This film is airily unspecific about such details, although every clip showing one of their film appearances is accompanied by a date, some going back to the 1940s.Manchester-reared Barry started out as a “ballet boy”, trained with famed dancer Stanislas Idzikowski whom he still refers to as his “beloved master”, and even appeared in Powell and Pressburger’s The Red Shoes in 1948. Joan, from the more genteel home counties, was a second or third generation musician and came up through the business as a dancer as well, but also tickled the ivories; now she mostly plays accompaniment on the piano in the couple’s studio as they train various adult pupils in the mysteries of commedia, diction and performance in general.The students interviewed here clearly adore them, and talk with endearing, gushy enthusiasm about the experience of learning from them. Director Audrey Rumsby, one of the Granthams’ students herself, clearly shares that affection but smartly upholsters her film with a rich seam of archive footage and original animation that goes well beyond the title couple themselves. As a result, the movie provides a brisk, efficient primer on commedia dell’arte, from its roots in Italy and on through Molière and Shakespeare, on to vaudeville and Max Miller, and right up to James Corden and One Man, Two Guvnors. Friends of the Granthams offer extra insight about the use of masks and acting skills. The whole package works a treat for theatre geeks, mime fans and lovers of “eccentric dance.” Barry & Joan is released on 6 May in cinemas."
This Much I Know to Be True review – Nick Cave and Warren Ellis on transcendent form,"Capturing intimate live performances of their albums Ghosteen and Carnage, Andrew Dominik’s documentary gets to the heart of a remarkable creative partnership",4,"There is something inherently cinematic about the work of Australian musicians and composers Nick Cave and Warren Ellis. The pair have collaborated on a string of scores for films, ranging from John Hillcoat’s 2005 antipodean western The Proposition (for which Cave also wrote the script) to the forthcoming Blonde, director Andrew Dominik’s adaptation of Joyce Carol Oates’s historical fiction novel about “the inner life of Marilyn Monroe”. Yet even away from the movie theatre, Ellis and Cave’s compositions have a widescreen sweep, conjuring intimate aural landscapes of love and death – religion and fairytale intertwined. These are musical parables of grief and redemption, echoing Cave’s belief that “we all live our lives dangerously, in a state of jeopardy, at the edge of calamity”.In his 2016 film One More Time With Feeling, Dominik (with whom the pair had worked on the underrated masterpiece The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford) documented the creative process behind the Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds album Skeleton Tree, a record forged in the wake of a terrible family tragedy. Now, Dominik turns his attention to a new chapter in Cave and Ellis’s musical saga, as they prepare songs from the albums Ghosteen and Carnage before a 2021 tour.Shot without an audience, in cavernous, church-like venues in Brighton and London where white lights illuminate pools of darkness visible, the performances are utterly engrossing, captured on hypnotically spiralling cameras by the Irish cinematographer Robbie Ryan. The atmosphere is stripped down and austere, allowing the songs to speak for themselves as they transport us from this world to the next.With trademark wry humour, Dominik’s film opens with Cave declaring that, during lockdown, he took the opportunity to retrain (against his manager’s advice) as a ceramicist. The fruits of his labour include a series of figurines telling the pathos-laden story of the devil; from birth, through war, to damnation and remorse. Later, Cave reveals that while he would once have described himself as a musician and writer, now he is striving to shed those labels in favour of being a husband, father, friend and citizen.He is also clearly a preacher, holding his fingers like a saint or a pope, while singing songs whose pulpit revelry is amplified by the gospel-style harmonies of his backing singers. There’s a touch of Vegas, too, about his trademark combination of suit and open-necked shirt – a familiar uniform that seems to imply the good, the bad and the ugly, all wrapped up in one seductively slender package.Ellis is no less striking, a brooding Catweazle-like figure on keyboard and fiddle, part Merlin, part hillbilly – Paganini meets Alvin Stardust. Whether conducting like a musical Kafka or playing the flute in a cardie, Ellis cuts a thrillingly mystical figure, making it all the more delightful when guest performer Marianne Faithfull asks in disbelief: “Did he just call you Waz?” It’s a throwaway moment, but one that embodies the balance between the ecstatic and the everyday that this documentary captures so perfectly.Conversations about Ellis and Cave’s disparate working methods are striking, with the latter insisting that Ellis is an agent of chaos who is always in “transmit” (rather than “receive”) mode, making it impossible to simply present him with anything as traditional as a “song”. “A whole lot of terrible shit happens when me and Warren get into a room,” Cave admits. “But there are these moments when it just… ” Ellis calls those moments “meditative”; Cave calls them “transcendent”.“Behind it all – the music, the words, the suits, the grief, the tenderness and shame and guilt and joy – who are you?” asks someone on Cave’s website, The Red Hand Files. It’s a question that Dominik seeks not to answer but rather to reflect, trusting his audience to make up their own mind about one of the most innovative collaborations that the worlds of film and music currently have to offer. In cinemas on Wednesday 11 May only; digital release to follow"
Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness review – one for diehard Marvel fans,"Self-referential in the extreme, this latest outing for dimension-hopping Benedict Cumberbatch is a largely joyless affair",2,"By definition, multiverses are everywhere. But do they really need to be quite so ubiquitous? The multiverse concept triggered a playful, pinballing game of narrative tag in the Spider-Man franchise, and unleashes an anarchic onslaught of silliness in Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert’s forthcoming Everything Everywhere All at Once. But in this latest outing for Benedict Cumberbatch’s Dr Strange, who is tasked with protecting dimension-hopping teen America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez) from nefarious forces intent on stealing her powers, the whole multiverse business is starting to feel more like a joylessly efficient get-out card to be played whenever the screenplay finds itself written into a corner.There’s an early high point in which Strange and Wong (Benedict Wong) are forced to do battle with a monocular giant octopus, while Rachel McAdams’s Christine, whose wedding has been interrupted by the tentacled gatecrasher, simply rolls her eyes. But the fun is short-lived, courtesy of Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) and director Sam Raimi’s commitment to grisly visual flourishes. Unlike movies such as Black Panther and Shang-Chi, which functioned as self-contained entities, this film requires an encyclopedic knowledge of Marvel minutiae and world-class cross-referencing skills to fully work. And who, outside the diehard fanbase, has the bandwidth for that level of commitment?"
We’re All Going to the World’s Fair review – online horror fails to load,"An isolated young woman gets sucked into an insidious internet game, but the terror never quite arrives",2,"A vulnerable teen embarks on a sinister online game in this uneasy, ultra-low-budget psychological horror. We’re All Going to the World’s Fair captures something of the hostile virtual terrain that today’s kids learn to navigate, encountering unknowable horrors that subtly change them for ever. As such, it probably taps more successfully into parental paranoia than it does into actual dark-web peril. Unfortunately, the film runs out of ideas and steam before it delivers any real scares."
Casablanca Beats review – Morocco’s vibrant school of hip-hop,Nabil Ayouch’s grittily authentic tale of a rapper turned teacher helping his students find their creative voices is a class act,4,"The Arabic title of Franco-Moroccan director Nabil Ayouch’s empowering hip-hop fable translates loosely as “rise your voice”, while in France, where the film competed for the Cannes Palme d’Or, it’s known as Haut et fort ­– “high and loud”. Both monikers perfectly capture the vibrant spirit of this stirring street musical, described by its creator as arising out of “the desire to make a film to give voice to young people”. On one level it’s a patchwork of popular cinematic tropes, combining the strength-through-music themes of films as diverse as 8 Mile and School of Rock with the inspirational classroom formats of everything from Blackboard Jungle to Dead Poets Society. But there’s also a strong whiff of the discursive politics of Ken Loach’s Land and Freedom, mixed with the accessible rebellion of Jafar Panahi’s Offside or Deniz Gamze Ergüven’s Mustang – a heady brew indeed.Real-life rapper turned teacher Anas Basbousi keeps things close to home as new teacher at an arts centre in the Sidi Moumen district of Casablanca, an area still stained by the spectre of fomenting terrorism. On his first day, Anas boldly spray-paints the wall of his classroom, only to be told that it’s not his classroom – it’s a classroom, one that is used by others who don’t necessarily appreciate his rebellious free-form vibe. Tensions increase when Anas meets his class, played by screen first-timers scouted at Les Étoiles de Sidi Moumen (a cultural centre co-founded by Ayouch), whose real lives inspired their fictional on-screen alter egos. As each student takes the floor to show the new teacher what they can do, he dismissively bats aside their efforts, accusing them of failing to use their authentic voices and reducing one misfit to tears for bragging about a life that bears little resemblance to his own.It’s formulaically clear from the outset where this is going, and no one should be in any doubt that Anas’s harsh words are merely an educational provocation, a wakeup call to the youngsters in whom he divines true potential. Sure enough, they soon start to step up, none more so than the young women whose rhymes tell hidden stories, leading to an outpouring of feminist strength that infuriates a zealous classmate nicknamed “the Imam”. Meanwhile, out-of-school lives start to intrude upon the classroom, with outraged parents banning their offspring from attending, leading to moral battles between Anas and his more stuffy superiors. There’s even a West Side Story-style confrontation with oppressive authority.Shot over 15 months, which allowed the project to grow organically, Ayouch’s film retains a gritty authenticity despite embracing often cliched dramatic tropes. Like Clio Barnard’s Ali & Ava, this down-to-earth tale is not afraid of embracing the magical elements of the musical. Yes, the vérité-style camerawork of Virginie Surdej and Amine Messadi creates “the illusion of a documentary” (there are shades of Nicolas Philibert’s Être et Avoir), convincing us that what we see on screen is “real”. But Khalid Benghrib’s sinewy choreography elevates the action above the everyday, creating fusions of poetry and dance that at times put me in mind of Philippe Lacôte’s hallucinogenic Ivorian prison drama Night of the Kings – a very different film, perhaps, but one that similarly blended elements of documentary and fantasia to thrilling effect.With original music by Mike and Fabien Kourtzer and performance scenes that take the cast from the classroom to the recording studio, the stage and beyond, Casablanca Beats (which, like Ayouch’s previous films Mektoub, Ali Zaoua: Prince of the Streets, Horses of God and Razzia, was Morocco’s entry for the Academy Awards) has an infectious energy that pulls us into the ever-changing worlds of its characters. Crucially, it does so in a manner that is both enticing and accessible, giving a platform to the young voices that Ayouch passionately believes are a positive force in increasingly troubled times, offering “a sign that the world is changing”. On this evidence, it’s hard to disagree."
Downton Abbey: A New Era review – an artless cash-in with the Crawleys,Reheated plot lines abound as the regular cast and writer Julian Fellowes go over old ground in their second big-screen outing,2,"The title of the second Downton Abbey movie promises a new era, but in fact this is a reheated serving of reassuringly familiar comfort food for fans of the series. The same crusty class certainties under the same cold, Wedgwood-blue skies; the same light sprinkling of xenophobia and the same eager score that bustles in between lines of dialogue like an over-solicitous waiter.The story takes up where the last picture, already something of a redundant postscript to the television series, left off: widower Tom Branson (Allen Leech) marries Lucy Smith (Tuppence Middleton). But the Crawley family is soon shaken by two events. First, fearsome matriarch Violet Crawley (Maggie Smith), whose bon mots are now a little bon moth-eaten but who remains one of the more entertaining characters, reveals that she has acquired a French villa. Second, a film crew invades Downton, causing much kerfuffle, but paying handsomely.In the collision between aristocracy and the world of entertainment, writer Julian Fellowes pays loving tribute to himself and his breakthrough film, Gosford Park. But a plot device that hinges on the transition between the silent movie era and the talkies is lifted rather more obviously from Singin’ in the Rain. It’s a comparison that does this artless cash-in no favours."
The Bezonians review – Vinnie Jones cameo can’t lift Homer-inspired crime yarn,"Don’t let the references to the Iliad fool you – this small-time gangster story is irritating, self-indulgent and stupid",1,"You can sort of tell what kind of film writer-director-co-star Savvas D Michael thought he was making, given the lofty references to Homer’s Iliad in the plotting, Martin Scorsese movies in the dialogue, and Guy Ritchie in the casting – given the presence here of Vinnie Jones in a cameo role. However, the result is an intensely irritating hot mess, a London petty criminal story set in the Greek Cypriot community that’s offensive, self-indulgent and stupid.The title refers to a private club of the same name, run by one Plato Andinos (Andreas Karras), a small-time big shot who likes to throw parties with strippers for his mates, and preaches homophobia and sexism at home to his kids. His wife, Helen (Marina Sirtis, from Star Trek Generations) puts up with it all because she gets knockoff designer handbags and a tacky house that makes the cribs in The Only Way Is Essex look like items from Architectural Digest. But Plato’s home life is only peripheral to the story, which mostly revolves around the exploits and hijinks of him and his crew, a motley selection of knaves, one of whom is a supposedly handsome and supposedly unbeatable scrapper named Achilles (played by Michael himself).Stung when his romantic overtures are rejected by local beauty-cum-poker-hustler Lola (Lois Brabin-Platt, whose display of sass represents one of the film’s few amusements), Achilles goes into a sulk in Homeric fashion. This causes considerable distress in particular to Achilles’ No 1 fan, Anthony (Jamie Crew), seemingly also expected to be considered an object of pity given Crew’s manic and mannered display of verbal diarrhoea, delivered with a speech impediment and jerky movements.Perhaps Anthony is the character for whom we’re supposed to feel sorry. That said, hardly anyone is even vaguely likable here, which needn’t necessarily have been a drawback, but they should at least be in some way interesting. No such luck. Londoners may find amusement in trying to guess where the exteriors were shot. The Bezonians is on digital platforms from 2 May."
Tonight’s Homework review – Kiarostami-inspired snapshot of Iran’s wealth gap,Inequality is exposed in a series of interviews with schoolkids in a heartbreaking doc that echoes Abbas Kiarostami’s documentary Homework,3,"A cheeky-faced boy of seven or eight is asked what he would wish for. “A big bike and a balloon that never bursts!” he replies with a huge grin, tickled with his answer. Another boy around the same age, more shabbily dressed and serious looking, is asked what life is about. He chews his bottom lip: “Life is something that is filled with difficulty.” This often heartbreaking, painful documentary from Ashkan Nejati and Mehran Nematollahi has a simple premise: interviewing Iranian schoolkids to camera about their lives, school, homework and hopes for the future.It’s a sequel of sorts to godfather of modern Iranian cinema Abbas Kiarostami’s 1989 documentary Homework, which put the same questions to children growing up in the shadow of the Iran-Iraq war. The new film features plenty of kids-say-the-funniest-things moments. A boy is asked which countries he’d like to visit? “Europe, America … Neptune!” And there’s some commentary on the Iranian education system. But what lingers is the film’s devastating snapshot of the gap between rich and poor. One of the rich kids, a placid round-faced boy, brags about how well-off his dad is and how many cars they’ve got. The interviewer gently probes him: do you know what wealth is? “Yes, someone who has a lot of cash like my dad.” Do you know what poverty is? “No.”If he ever watches the film he’ll find out. You can spot the poor kids instantly, and not just from their faded, many-times-washed sweaters and DIY haircuts. It’s their clenched body language and lined-before-their-time serious faces – a reminder that for them there’s no time for silliness or play. The headteacher of these boys explains that in calendar years, they are eight to 10, but maturity wise, more like 17 or 18. Most work afternoons and evenings, selling goods on the street or busking. One boy explains how he burns newspaper and rubs the soot on his face to look dirtier, more pitiable. Another pays his family’s rent and food. “I don’t buy toys. When you need to fill your belly, you don’t buy toys.” It’s not an easy watch, but these kids are invisible enough without the world shutting its eyes. Tonight’s Homework is released on 22 April at Bertha DocHouse, London."
The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent review – Nicolas Cage is Nicolas Cage,"Playing himself, Cage serves the acting fans love him for – but has this strained action comedy spoiled the joke?",2,"Nicolas Cage has officially revealed he’s in on the joke … if “joke” is precisely what it is. But has that spoiled the joke – if that is the correct word? This is a self-aware action comedy whose title is possibly the funniest bit, riffing on Milan Kundera’s The Unbearable Lightness of Being as well as possibly Dave Eggers’s memoir A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius. Producer-star Cage plays “Nick Cage”: Hollywood ledge and national treasure (to quote a relevant movie title) now in a midlife crisis, haunted by CGI-doppelganger visions of his angry younger self, no longer booking the big roles and facing a grim future in which, as his agent (Neil Patrick Harris) puts it, he plays the cool gay uncle in a Duplass brothers film.Cage is living in a hotel, estranged from his wife Olivia (a thanklessly unfunny role for Sharon Horgan) and moody teen daughter Addy (Lily Mo Sheen), who hates the movie classics he tries introducing her to. (I was waiting for Addy to declare herself instead a massive fan of movies by the Coppola family. Maybe that would be an in-joke too far.) Cash-strapped Cage is forced to accept a million-dollar appearance fee at the spectacular luxury home of a billionaire plutocrat Javi Gutierrez (Pedro Pascal) who is a besotted superfan. But then the CIA gets word to our hero that Javi is a dangerous cartel gangster and Cage must use his privileged access to bring him down.There are some entertaining meta-touches here, but the entire Gutierrez plot is strained and borderline dull. Pascal isn’t a natural comic and the movie winds up fudging his crucial bad-guy status. As for Cage, this isn’t like Leslie Nielsen sending up his erstwhile straight-lead image for Airplane! and The Naked Gun, nor is it exactly like John Malkovich fabricating a complex fictional self in Being John Malkovich. Cage simply plays Cage in the moderate script he’s been given, in that utterly committed, strangely uncomplicated way that has won the hearts of fans who declare themselves on the right side of the laugh-with/laugh-at dividing line. But Cage has already done a far more interesting postmodern film about the film business – Spike Jonze’s Adaptation, written by Charlie Kaufman, in which Cage gave a far better (dual) performance in a much funnier and better written film as the tormented screenwriter-artist Charlie Kaufman and his middlebrow twin brother Donald. In comparison, this feels lightweight. The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent is released on 22 April in cinemas."
Playground review – kid’s-eye-view nightmare of schoolyard bullying,"Maya Vanderbeque makes an amazing debut as seven-year-old Nora, who tells on the boys bullying her brother with nightmarish consequences",4,"Laura Wandel’s debut feature was Belgium’s official submission for the Oscars: a kid’s-eye-view nightmare of playground bullying impossible to watch without a sick, jittery feeling of rage and dread. The original French title is “Un Monde” – “A World” – and the playground is a universe of fear which we all edit out of our adult memories.A rather amazing seven-year-old newcomer called Maya Vanderbeque stars as Nora, seen mostly in extreme, searching closeup. Just the opening shot of her crying face supplies pretty much enough emotional charge to power the whole film. Nora is just starting school, and her sobbing mini-drama-queen distress at the school gates discomforts her dad (Karim Leklou) and especially her older brother Abel (Günter Duret), a wannabe tough guy who doesn’t want his clingy kid sister embarrassing him in the playground. When she witnesses him being bullied by the other boys – with whom Abel had hoped to bully someone else – she tells the teachers and her dad, thus humiliating him and breaking a whole unwritten statute book about not snitching.At first, Nora artlessly tries informing on the bullies to her own teacher, Mme Agnès (Laura Verlinden) whose ineffective attempts at rebuking the boys appears to irritate their teacher, whose prerogative this actually is, and who perhaps sees Mme Agnès’s intervention as an implied criticism of her professionalism. And so at the crucial moment she has neither the time nor the inclination to back her up: a fatal concession. And when Nora’s dad clumsily tries yelling at the bullies, it naturally makes things far worse, a mishandled situation which metastasises horribly.A world of adult indifference is revealed: those supposed authority figures are way out of the frame, as remote as the uniformed prison guards patrolling the exercise yard. As with Yasmin Reza’s stage-play Carnage, filmed by Roman Polanski in 2011, or perhaps the enigmatic schoolgates scene that closes Michael Haneke’s 2005 film Hidden, the power politics of kids has implications for the adults. The playground’s hidden theatre of violence echoes in the headteacher’s office and in the kitchens at home, among the grownups whose own childhoods involved dutifully learning the lesson that violence is unacceptable – but who find that anger is still a natural instinct when it comes to protecting and being seen to protect.As for Nora herself, the film shows us that she is not exactly a moral agent: she fiercely objects to bullying, but also unhelpfully denounces Abel’s failure to stand up for himself and objects to anyone’s failure to take her feelings into account. It is her tactless courage and willingness to intervene that is finally to make a difference – but she is also a bit of an egotist. There is a telling scene in which she hugs her beloved Mme Agnès with that same theatrically possessive desperation she showed in the opening shot, which makes the teacher just the tiniest bit impatient with her.At just 72 minutes, this is a brief, intense feature: it’s possible that Wandel envisaged it as even shorter than it actually is, and perhaps its narrative tendons slacken a little after the initial spasm of horror. But what an incredible performance from Vanderbeque: an intuition of fear and pain and moral outrage that goes beyond acting. Playground is released on 22 April on cinemas."
Ennio review – Giuseppe Tornatore’s heartfelt tribute to film composer Morricone,"The maestro talks about what drove his famous scores while actors, directors and musical peers celebrate his contribution to cinema",4,"This documentary represents a painstakingly detailed, fantastically entertaining, and profoundly exhausting deep dive into the career of the hyper-prolific Italian composer Ennio Morricone, known best perhaps for his orchestral scores for Sergio Leone (including the so-called Dollars Trilogy and Once Upon a Time in the West), Gillo Pontecorvo’s The Battle of Algiers, Bernardo Bertolucci’s 1900 – and a whole bunch of American films, ranging from the great (Terrence Malick’s Days of Heaven, Brian De Palma’s The Untouchables) to the abominable (Quentin Tarantino’s The Hateful Eight).It’s not so much the running time of 156 minutes that will tire you out as the incredible sonic, visual and emotional overload generated by the work itself; perhaps this is ideally seen first in a cinema for maximum impact and then again in small, digestible chunks at home. It’s one huge cinematic mosaic that tessellates a massive interview with the man himself (fortuitously filmed just before he died in 2020) with acres of archival footage and snippets from the movies he wrote soundtracks for.On top of that, there’s hundreds of interview clips from his innumerable collaborators, friends and admirers – even if some of them seem to be there just to show off how good the producers were at snagging big names. (Bruce Springsteen, for example, is a bit too gushy and hyperbolic.) However, any weak spots are more than compensated for by the overall level of discourse that gives paramount place to the music above all else, with intelligent, pithy observations from Morricone’s classical composer contemporaries such as Boris Porena, as well as other film music maestros including Hans Zimmer and Mychael Danna.As you would expect, there are lots of lovely personal anecdotes from assorted collaborators, including Joan Baez and singers little known outside of Italy who remember Morricone’s innovative arrangements for RCA pop songs before he moved into film. English director Roland Joffé is particularly entertaining, showing off his Italian while discussing Morricone’s mighty score for Joffé’s The Mission, which we see performed by a massive orchestra with Morricone conducting. Given the documentary’s director is Giuseppe Tornatore, it’s no surprise a small chunk is given over to his collaborations with Morricone such as Cinema Paradiso, but on the whole Tornatore makes it ultimately about his main subject. Kudos is also due to editor Massimo Quaglia’s astonishingly fluid work splicing it all together. Ennio is released on 22 April in cinemas and on digital platforms."
White Building review – Cambodia’s modernist masterpiece is centre of attention,This gentle-going watch injects sensitivity and insight into the story of a family’s displacement at the hands of property developers,3,"This soulful, heavy hearted drama tells a tale of gentrification and community displacement in Cambodia. It’s a fictional story about the real-life White Building, an iconic modernist apartment block built in 1963 in the centre of Phnom Penh and demolished in 2017. The film’s director, Kavich Neang, has a personal connection: he grew up in the White Building and opens his film with an extraordinary drone shot that floats above the building’s roof. From this angle the mosaic of chipped tiles and rusted corrugated sheets looks strangely beautiful: a metaphor perhaps for the White Building itself, which is crumbling and not fit for habitation, but still home to a vibrant diverse community, everyone happily jostling in the corridors.Neang’s story is about a boy’s coming of age as his family is evicted. Piseth Chhun gives a sensitive performance as Nang, who at the start of the movie, bleached streaks in his hair, dreams of boyband-style fame with his hip-hop dance squad, which is basically him and two mates. He lives with his mum and sculptor dad in the building, whose residents are being pushed out so property developers can move in. The miserably low payoff will force most of them out of the city, where house prices are skyrocketing.The film follows Nang as he matures from boy to man. His dad is spokesman for the tenants’ association, and there are bad-tempered meetings about whether to accept the eviction deal. Then the building’s water supply is switched off. Worryingly, Nang’s dad has an infected big toe, which appears to be gangrenous, a complication of diabetes; the blackening spreads like the mould on the apartment’s ceiling.This is a gentle-going watch, understated – underpowered even – and sometimes a little drowsy. Still, it has real sensitivity and insight into the transition to adulthood, as gradually it dawns on Nang that his parents don’t have all the answers.White Building is available on Mubi from Wednesday."
Choose or Die review – gory Netflix video game horror,There’s a surprisingly nasty edge to this tolerable yet derivative wannabe franchise-starter about a cursed game from the 80s,2,"It’s strange that the silly but mostly tolerable horror Choose or Die was an acquisition rather than a homegrown Netflix original given how much it seems algorithmically modeled for the notoriously formula-obsessed platform. It stars Asa Butterfield, an in-house star thanks to the success of Sex Education. It’s contemporary-set but baked in 80s nostalgia, something that also inspires the aesthetic of the aforementioned comedy series as well as the entirety of long-running hit Stranger Things. It also focuses on a cursed video game, making it a close cousin to the streamer’s interactive Black Mirror hit Bandersnatch. It’s a film destined to live its days in the “if you like” container.It’ll probably fare well there as fans of the above might find just about enough here to play with although they might, like me, be a little surprised at just how nasty this quickie horror is, made with closer attention to the gore quotient than any level of creativity. It’s part of the cursed tech subgenre that expanded after the success of Gore Verbinski’s surprisingly effective remake of Ringu, later retitled The Ring. It led to more similarly plotted Asian horror remakes, such as One Missed Call, Pulse and Shutter, and then also a string of US copycats, like Feardotcom, Unfriended and Stay Alive, a 2006 flop that saw a group of teens playing a deadly video game. We’re in similar, yet mildly more proficient, territory here with the discovery of a dusty 80s game called CURS>R (the film’s original title), that coerces players into making genuine life-or-death decisions.It’s found by 80s-obsessive Isaac (Butterfield), compelled by the idea that the $125,000 prize money might still lay unclaimed and further seduced by the recorded voice of Freddy Krueger himself, Robert Englund, at the end of the hotline. His friend, and object of affection, Kayla (relative newcomer Iola Evans) is less convinced but living on the breadline has her willing to take a chance, struggling to get by on a measly cleaner’s wage. And so it begins.What’s vaguely refreshing about this admittedly rather ho-hum set-up is that Kayla isn’t the hands-on-hips scold she might have been in another more cliche version of this story but the one who boots up the game herself to play. She’s as tech-savvy as Isaac and the film’s main, plot-propelling protagonist. The first encounter with the game sees Kayla playing in an empty diner, forced to watch a flirty waitress eat glass in front of her. It’s a bracingly nasty scene, automatically cluing us into the torture porn-adjacent territory we’re in, far from what we might have expected (there’s a whiff of the far superior Escape Room films here which exist firmly in the world of PG-13).But while the gore is impressively visceral and well-realised, the rest of it is a few steps behind. It’s an overwhelmingly British film, shot in London with local actors (there’s a bookending appearance from Eddie Marsan while soap stalwart Angela Griffin also pops up), that’s bizarrely set in an unnamed US city, forcing everyone into at times laughably shoddy Ay-meh-reek-uhn accents. It’s a baffling misstep, clearly made for commercial reasons, that adds a layer of amateurishness to what’s otherwise a solidly directed first feature for Brit Toby Meakins. He doesn’t quite take enough advantage of his reality-shifting game sequences (the Englund voice cameo serves to remind us just how wild Wes Craven made those nightmares way back when) but it’s a cut above the average Netflix genre guff.The script, from TV writer Simon Allen, acts as mostly just pedestrian framework for the game scenes, which thankfully do arrive quite often. The specifics of the plot make little to no real sense, even in the moment, but that won’t much matter to the sleepover crowd, who’ll be too distracted by the nasty noise of it all. Don’t understand how a malevolent curse ties to game code? Who cares, here’s a teenager eating his arm! In a choice between coherence and cruelty, it’s an easy win.Choose or Die is available on Netflix now"
Queen Lear review – all-female acting troupe do a village Shakespeare,This heartwarming documentary about local villagers touring rural Turkey is full of transformative encounters and communal enjoyment,3,"In the opening scenes of Pelin Esmer’s heartwarming documentary, the sublime and the quotidian are beautifully intertwined. The tranquil sight of a group of older women enjoying a seaside dip is juxtaposed with a striking view of the Roman amphitheatre overlooking the deep blue ocean. Unassuming in appearance, the women quickly transform into thespians, taking over the ancient site and making it a rehearsal space for an amateur production of King Lear. Coming from an impoverished rural background, this unlikely peasant-women theatre troupe brings the magic of Shakespeare to remote Turkish villages where even the basic staple of drinking-water is nonexistent.Their performances often take place on school playgrounds, and are rudimentary in terms of costuming and staging. Wearing their own clothes, the women give Shakespeare a regional otherworldliness. And alongside the evident communal pleasure inspired by such events, the off-stage interactions between the performers and the villagers are equally fascinating. Zeynep, who plays Lear, confides her youthful hope of becoming a nurse, which was was quickly quashed by her father’s order that she must stick to raising goats. Performing has ignited a transformative sense of confidence in Zeynep, however. And the young girl she confides in has her own dream of teaching, though her future seems uncertain.The film’s freewheeling structure makes for a great intimacy with its subjects but it doesn’t help the viewer with the physical orientation of events, especially not those unfamiliar with the local geography. However, though modest in terms of visuals and scope, Queen Lear is an endearing ode to the collective power of art and a subtle call for gender equality in Turkey. Queen Lear is available on 18 April on True Story."
Who Killed the KLF? review – Chris Atkins’ entertaining guide to true pop mavericks,Documentary-maker Chris Atkins tells the strange story of gigantic chart hits and guerrilla pranking of the art world,4,"British film-maker Chris Atkins is known for his excellent Bafta-winning documentary Taking Liberties in 2007 and also for his five-year jail sentence in 2016 for tax fraud involving falsified invoices: a conviction that sent a there-but-for-grace-of-God shiver through the British film world. It resulted in Atkins’s bestselling prison memoir A Bit of a Stretch, which also became a hugely popular podcast. At the time I wrote about the heavy-handed prison treatment of Atkins’s co-defendant, Christina Slater, who at the time was a new mother.Now Atkins has hit upon the ideal subject for what I can only describe as his talent for investigative mischief: it’s the strange story of the KLF, later the K Foundation, comprising Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty, the electronic-pop-duo-slash-situationist–art-collective who in the early 90s had gigantic chart hits with singles including 3am Eternal and What Time Is Love?, and then morphed into a guerrilla unit pranking what they saw as the money-crazed art world. They finally deleted their entire catalogue in a spectacular gesture of renunciation, and publicly set fire to the remaining million pounds in their bank account.Atkins reconstructs some of the band’s occult events and theatre-of-the-absurd Guy Debord one-offs; he interviews some of the band’s gobsmacked contemporaries and fans such as journalist James Brown, author Alan Moore and DJ Carl Cox, and claims that his audio interviews with Drummond and Cauty used here are “previously unheard tapes” – although we don’t get to find out how and where these tapes surfaced. Could Atkins be playfully hinting that these tapes and the band’s apparent non-cooperation with his film are not quite what they seem?Either way, it’s a very entertaining guide through what has to be the strangest A-list pop career of modern times: a band who started weird and anti-materialistic, ended weird and anti-materialistic, and didn’t sell out. And as for the million-pound-blaze, Atkins does his best to reconstruct the band’s thinking. Most supposed the stunt to be either a pointless hoax or, if real, an obscene waste, given all the poverty in the world, and the film hints that the band themselves might just have had the nagging doubt that they had made a terrible mistake. It was a grand gesture which, to the extent that it was noticed at all, was a misfire. But it was a misfire born of their absolute refusal to conform to the careerist notion of success.Actually, this film reminded me of Banksy’s 2010 documentary Exit Through the Gift Shop, in which the artist showed off his cardboard box full of faked £10 notes with the face of Diana, Princess of Wales on them instead of the Queen’s – forgeries that could in theory have got him into serious trouble. You could end the film wondering if the KLF even existed at all, if they were a dream or a countercultural mirage. If so, this is an enjoyable journey across the surface of an illusion. Who Killed the KLF? is available now on digital platforms."
"Orphans review – buoyant musical about death, grief and boozing","SEC Armadillo, GlasgowFour adult siblings react to their mother’s death in wildly different ways, in this raucous musical adaptation of Peter Mullan’s 1998 film black comedy",4,"If the idea of a musical about grief sounds unlikely, it can only be because we have a limited idea of what that emotion should look like. The grief in Peter Mullan’s 1998 movie Orphans is not of the maudlin, greetings-card kind. Rather, it is raw, dangerous and off-kilter.So it is in this National Theatre of Scotland staging, directed by Cora Bissett and scripted by Douglas Maxwell with songs by Roddy Hart and Tommy Reilly. It amplifies Mullan’s emotional states into the raucous, the ribald and the plaintive.Set on a dark and stormy Glasgow night, Orphans is about four siblings from a working-class Catholic family who are about to bury their mother. Each embodies a different facet of grief.Robert Florence as elder brother Thomas becomes neurotically protective of the dead woman’s memory, his anguish so profound it seems to rip the roof off the church. Reuben Joseph as Michael turns inward, reflecting on his damaged relationship with his ex-wife as he heads out for a bloody night of self-destruction.Dylan Wood as youngest brother John turns angry, displacing his sense of loss into a thirst for revenge and gun-toting violence. Amy Conachan’s Sheila appears the most balanced, but she too races with a reckless abandon to fill the void left by the central figure in her life.The chaos of the night, with its fights, funfairs and feuds, stands as a metaphor for the family’s inner turmoil. And even though it begins with a coffin and ends with a grave, the emotional extremes put a halt to sentimentality.They also make for a buoyant show. Staged on a set of towering sandstone tenements by Emily James, Bissett’s production makes as much of the wider community – from the chorus of boozy drinkers to a trio of sharp-talking paper girls – as it does of the central players.Faithful to the big-screen original, Maxwell’s script is characteristically funny while respecting Mullan’s dark edges. It’s a shame not to have live musicians, but the songs do well to carry the story forward, while cheerfully revelling in the Glasgow vernacular (not all of it is radio friendly). It adds up to a cathartic reckoning with mortality. Perhaps even good grief.At SEC Armadillo, Glasgow, until 9 April. Then touring until 30 April."
Compartment No 6 review – meet-uncute train romance is a Finnish Before Sunrise,An archaeology student is on her way to Russia’s remote north-west when she has to share a compartment with a shaven-headed drunk ,4,"In a flourish of passive-aggressive self-pity and spite, Vladimir Putin recently claimed that Russian culture was being cancelled in the west. The release of this excellent film proves him wrong: a movie about a Russian character behaving menacingly to someone from Finland, Russia’s vulnerable neighbour, and yet being romantically redeemed. There is a bone-chilling cold in the film’s location – Murmansk in Russia’s remote north-west – but a wonderful human warmth and humour in this offbeat story of strangers on a train and of national characteristics starting to melt.It comes from Finnish director Juho Kuosmanen, whose 2016 film The Happiest Day in the Life of Olli Mäki was a lovely comedy about a real-life Finnish boxing champ in the 1960s. His new film is adapted from a novel of the same name by Finnish artist and author Rosa Liksom, and concerns a young Finnish student of archaeology, Laura (Seidi Haarla) who is in Moscow sometime in the early 90s; she has begun an impulsive affair with her professor, Irina (Dirana Drukarova). With Irina’s encouragement, and perhaps because this older woman does not care to have her hanging around much longer, Laura has resolved to make the tough rail journey up to Murmansk where she wants to view the petroglyphs – mysterious rock drawings, thousands of years old.Sweet-natured, open-hearted Laura gets on this uncomfortable train in the freezing wintry cold, where she finds that she must share compartment number 6 with Ljoha (Yuriy Borisov), a boorish, drunk young guy who is on his way to get a job in a coal mine in Murmansk and is openly abusive, misogynistic and philistine about Laura’s plans. And her phone calls back to Moscow reveal that Irina isn’t exactly pining for her.Of course, it isn’t too much of a stretch to see that after their meet-uncute, the relationship of Ljoha and Laura is going to thaw, although the obviousness of this trope has lessened in the last month. The romance that flowers between these two young people is in parallel with the romance of a long rail journey, and this is a very non-American equivalent of Richard Linklater’s Before Sunrise movies. Ljoha’s scowling face and shaven, bullet head make him look a tough guy at first, but it isn’t long before we see him as a vulnerable little boy, never more so than when with Laura welcomes another Finnish guy to share their carriage - a self-admiringly sensitive type who insists on singing and playing his guitar. Ljoha is fiercely sceptical and resentful of this preening interloper, and he is right to be.In the end, no one wants to help Laura find these petroglyphs that she has set her heart on and travelled so far to see, and it is Ljoha himself who has to step up. Yes, this is a Russian without a Z on his clothes or in his heart, and of course the larger point is that of course, there are millions of Ljoha’s fellow citizens who cannot be tarred by the malign mediocrity of Putin’s chauvinism. There is charm and gentleness in this scene and the movie as a whole. Compartment No 6 is released on 8 April in cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema. This article was amended on 25 April 2022 to correct the name of male lead character Ljoha, from Vadim as an earlier version mistakenly said."
Julia review – larger-than-life US cookery queen offers self-indulgent rhapsodising,A competent film on TV chef Julia Child asks all the right questions without bursting into life – and there are more interesting dramas about her already,2,"Here is a celebratory documentary that takes for granted throughout that its audience is already hugely invested in its subject: the American TV chef and larger-than-life personality Julia Child. She is sufficiently legendary in the United States to have rated a biopic impersonation by Meryl Streep in the 2009 film Julie & Julia and also by Britain’s Sarah Lancashire in the recent HBO TV series Julia (alongside an otherwise largely American cast). Added to which, Dan Aykroyd once did a Julia Child sketch on Saturday Night Live and David Cross in the TV comedy Arrested Development did a whooping Julia Child voice when he dressed up as a Mrs Doubtfire nanny.As for this documentary, it’s a professionally made film with reasonable things to say about the birth of TV celebrity chef culture, challenging male dominance in the professional kitchen and Child’s role in promoting the pre-eminence of French cuisine among America’s emerging food-literate middle classes. But just as with that Meryl Streep movie, I found myself restless at the parochiality of this American icon, although the film does briefly ponder the French public’s lack of interest in her.So why exactly should anyone outside the US care about Child? Do we expect American audiences to be fascinated by documentaries about Fanny Cradock? As far as UK audiences are concerned … well, why not a documentary about a Canadian TV chef? Or a Bulgarian TV chef? Or a Japanese TV chef? Of course, the American children’s TV presenter Fred Rogers – glimpsed here – was also not much known in the UK, and the Tom Hanks film from 2019 about him, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood went over well. But that had a story to tell that reached out beyond the fanbase. And without that initial fanbase buy-in, Julia feels like a redundant tribute, with something very indulgent about the “foodie” rhapsodising. Julia is released on 8 April in cinemas."
All the Old Knives review – Chris Pine and Thandiwe Newton add class to CIA spy drama,Pine and Newton play former lovers in this watchable Le Carré-esque tale of personal and patriotic betrayals,4,"Maybe a little unexpectedly, Amazon Studios have given us a very watchable and classily upscale espionage drama-thriller in the spirit of John le Carré. Danish film-maker Janus Metz Pedersen directs and Olen Steinhauer adapts his own much-admired spy novella, centred on two former lovers in the cloak and dagger business who meet for dinner in a chi-chi Californian restaurant. The story is in fact inspired by a BBC TV drama that had nothing to do with spies: The Song of Lunch starring Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman.Henry Pelham (Chris Pine) is a CIA officer haunted by a disastrous event eight years earlier, when he was at the Vienna station: a plane hijacking ended in a hundred deaths because the terrorists were somehow able to anticipate the authorities’ counter-attack. And he is still heartbroken because his CIA colleague Celia Harrison (Thandiwe Newton), with whom he was and is deeply in love, broke up with him just afterwards, abandoned the service and is now a placidly contented wife and mother in Carmel, California.Now Henry’s hardbitten station chief Vic Wallinger (Laurence Fishburne) tells him there is evidence they had a mole – and Henry is now tasked with the emotionally painful duty of reopening the wounds and interviewing the suspects, including the shifty and evasive operative Bill (Jonathan Pryce) who is these days in semi-retirement, muttering resentfully into his whisky in a London pub. But Henry also has to travel to Carmel to ask Celia out to a restaurant to interrogate her over dinner. And Vic doesn’t want loose ends or official inquiries: if Celia’s answers are unsatisfactory, Henry has Vic’s authority to terminate her with extreme prejudice.The result is a complex confrontation over an Instagram-perfect meal with dizzying flashbacks to Vienna and flashbacks within flashbacks to Henry’s service in Moscow 12 years before that. It is the classic Le Carré conflation of three different sorts of betrayal: personal, professional and patriotic. Pine and Newton handle this choreography with maturity and style; Newton particularly shows how impressive she is with the right role. All the Old Knives is released on 8 April in cinemas and on Prime Video."
The Bad Guys review – Looney Tunes meets the Oceans series in animated crime caper,"Animal villains get a taste of being good in this sharp, snappy family film",3,"“I’m not bad, I’m just drawn that way.” Jessica Rabbit purred the famous line in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, but it’s a plight with which the key characters in this enjoyably manic DreamWorks animation might identify. A sharp-suited wolf, a tech-wizard tarantula, a grumpy snake, a piranha with impulse control issues and a shark who happens to be a master of disguise: all are accustomed to striking fear into the hearts of those who encounter them. A career in crime was inevitable. But just at the moment when they are about to pull off their biggest job, the Bad Guys get a taste of being good. And, thanks to a saintly guinea pig voiced by Richard Ayoade, they might just have a chance at rehabilitation.Like Roger Rabbit, the pacing owes a debt to the demented frenzy of classic Looney Tunes animations, but the film also nods to heist movies, notably the Oceans series. It’s deliberately preposterous – the disguises are rarely more convincing than the kind of false nose and moustache combo you might find in a cracker. But there’s a kernel of believability where it matters: in the easy repartee and fully fleshed friendships. It’s sharp, silly and frequently very funny."
True Things review – seductively dangerous liaisons in Ramsgate,Ruth Wilson is mesmerising as an unhappy benefits officer who develops an unhealthy attraction to a charismatic stranger in Harry Wootliff’s assured psychological drama,4,"After her wonderfully engrossing feature debut, Only You, writer-director Harry Wootliff turns to a rather more toxic relationship, balancing elements of romantic melodrama and psychological thriller in a film powered by modern gothic passions. Loosely adapted from Deborah Kay Davies’s book True Things About Me, it’s a disturbingly seductive (and often unexpectedly funny) portrayal of manipulation and deceit that gets right under the skin of its protagonist, brilliantly played by Ruth Wilson, who walks a tightrope between enchantment and endangerment. With great physical poise and precision, Wilson (who optioned and developed the source book) engages the audience on a visceral level, her deceptively low-key performance taking us deep inside her character’s dreams, desires and insecurities.Wilson plays Kate, a somewhat tremulous thirtysomething daydreamer whose personal life has stalled and who is just about holding down a humdrum job at a benefits office in Ramsgate. When a charismatic claimant (Tom Burke) cockily asks what she’s doing for lunch, Kate flirtatiously throws caution to the wind and soon finds herself in an unexpectedly erotic car-park encounter that is as thrilling as it is risky. Like Kate, we know little or nothing about her mesmerising new lover, whom she names Blond, but whose particulars (his history, his status, even his whereabouts) remain enigmatically vague. What we do know is that Kate becomes instantly addicted to his pointedly unpredictable attentions, craving his calls and his company, infatuated with his presence – all the more so in his frustratingly frequent absence.Kate’s friends and family are understandably suspicious, none more so than Alison (Hayley Squires), who has been trying to fix Kate up with a suitable partner with whom to settle down. For Alison, this interloper is just another bad decision – a chaotic presence that has overtaken the needy Kate’s life, clouding her senses and her judgment. “So you’re going to rescue him are you?” asks Alison when Kate insists that their dependence is mutual, even when Blond effectively makes off with her car. Yet whenever he reappears, the spark is rekindled, keeping alive the possibility that a better, more exciting life awaits Kate, just beyond her reach.Wootliff has described True Things as “a cautionary tale of a destructive sexual relationship that is both complex and ordinary”, adding that this relationship seems “so familiar” as to be “almost a rite of passage”. While Wootliff may be referring specifically to “a woman’s sense of self” as explored or defined through relationships, the film’s appealcrosses gender boundaries. Anyone who has ever defined themselves through the eyes of others, or sought self-worth in unworthy romance, will recognise both the agony and ecstasy of Kate’s predicament. That tension burns at the heart of True Things, making Kate both a passive observer of and active agent in circumstances beyond her control. Crucially, no matter how much her passion devours her, it also drives her – albeit to distraction.Having brilliantly embodied the suavely duplicitous Anthony in Joanna Hogg’s The Souvenir, Burke here seems to channel the spirit of Oliver Reed, investing his character with a blend of animal magnetism and fear of intimacy that feeds hungrily upon Kate’s own conflicted responses. When he tells her that she’s “lovely”, there’s something of the fairytale wolf about his words, as if he were preparing to eat her. Yet, like Red Riding Hood, Kate is more resourceful than she seems.In Only You, Josh O’Connor and Laia Costa danced to the anguished strains of Elvis Costello’s I Want You in a scene that showcased Wootliff’s ability to tell a story through movement and music. Dance plays a crucial role in True Things too, as PJ Harvey’s Rid of Me soundtracks a defining scene of character-driven choreography in which Wootliff and Wilson work in perfect harmony with cinematographer Ashley Connor, whose close-up expressionist images have a tactile, sensuous quality. Plaudits, too, to composer Alex Baranowski, whose plucked, processed sounds create a sonic backdrop that perfectly captures Kate’s anxiously evolving spirit, simultaneously evoking impending catastrophe and ecstatic escape."
The Novice review – stunning debut passes the university challenge,Lauren Hadaway’s intriguing film plays with the texture of sound as it follows an ambitious student trying out for the college rowing team,5,"There’s a voice inside the head of college freshman Alex (a remarkable, physically and mentally committed Isabelle Fuhrman) that drives her. Hectoring, inescapable: this inner voice is the reason she chose to major in physics, her weakest subject, just so that she can conquer it. It’s the reason that not only does she sign up for the college’s novice rowing programme, she pushes herself to bleeding and breaking point to be the best, to make it into the elite varsity team. This voice, a muttered inner mantra that is as compulsive and damaging in its way as the impulse to self-harm, is integral to this stunning feature debut, contributing to the film’s intriguingly textured and three-dimensional sound design. The aural component of the movie – voices flayed and torn up, bleeding into a score that at first nods to the austere traditions of the campus, before taking on a more clattering and agitated character – is foregrounded to an unusual degree. It’s not surprising to learn that its writer and director, Lauren Hadaway, who based this film on her own experiences on a college rowing team, has a background in sound editing.Hadaway’s sound department work includes Zack Snyder’s Justice League and Quentin Tarantino’s The Hateful Eight. But it’s another of her credits, Damien Chazelle’s Whiplash, which is the most useful reference point for The Novice. Both films are punishingly intense portraits of ambition tipping over into obsession. Both are stylistically bold and confrontational pieces of film-making. Both feature central performances which are feats of physical endurance. And both announced a significant new voice in US cinema. I can’t wait to see – and hear – what she does next."
Coppelia review – cleverly conceived modern update of Delibes’ classic ballet,Animation and dance combine in new version of the story of a boy lured from his sweetheart by a mechanical doll controlled by an evil genius,3,"Here is a cinematic adaptation of Léo Delibes’ ballet that blends animation, visual effects and live-action dancing, drawing on the rejigged story and score created for a Dutch National Ballet production of the show from 2008.Like several other modern productions, this version updates to the present the 19th-century ETA Hoffman-derived story of a village boy lured away from his human sweetheart by a mechanical doll controlled by an evil genius. Instead of a lifesize wind-up toy danced by a prima ballerina, here Coppelia is imagined as an animated dancebot whose high blond beehive with flip curls recalls Lisa Marie’s alien temptress from Mars Attacks! Her controller, Doctor Coppelius (Vito Mazzeo), seems to be offering his services to the townsfolk as a kind of plastic surgeon, but he’s actually using brainwashing techniques to steal their human essences – strength, intelligence and something symbolised by a heart (emotional intelligence? Passion? Emoji power?) – and transfer them into Coppelia.Local juice bar jockey Swan (Michaela DePrince) works out something is seriously amiss and teams up with her corps de ballet pals to thwart Coppelius and save her true love Franz (Daniel Camargo). Semiretired ballet superstar Darcey Bussell is on hand as the town’s mayor, but she is careful not to upstage DePrince, who really shines with a natural photogenic presence, strong acting skills and athletic form. The whole shooting match eschews the use of dialogue, so for all its modernist trappings it’s a pretty traditional ballet production – though one that uses a lot of green screen backgrounds and digital dancers. When the latter, with their uncanny-valley features, perform alongside the human cast, the difference in expressiveness is oddly unsettling, making this feel like some insane mashup of the silent film classic Metropolis, old-school dance and the children’s TV show LazyTown from the early 00s. But in a mostly fun way. Coppelia is released on 1 April in cinemas."
The Tinderbox review – scrupulous excavation of Middle East conflict,A sober documentary shows colonial Britain’s role in the Israel-Palestine divide,3,"Thoroughly researched and scrupulously balanced, this documentary, written, directed and presented by television producer Gillian Mosely (Tony Robinson’s World War 1), excavates the history of the Israel-Palestine conflict and attempts to engage with both sides of a seemingly unbridgeable divide. It is sober, thought-provoking stuff which, while it relies on some fairly hackneyed soundtrack choices (Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata and other classical greatest hits), surprises and illuminates elsewhere.The fingerprints of Britain, with colonial policies that ignored common sense and human rights, can be found on a timebomb that dates back to the first world war. It is fascinating, if rather bleak, but does seem better suited to television than to a cinema release. The Tinderbox is in cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema"
Ambulance review – a decent B-movie spoiled by the Michael Bay treatment,"The maximalist director overcooks his adaptation of a 2005 Danish thriller, while Jake Gyllenhall lets rip",2,"An endless sprawl of a film set in the endless sprawl of LA, Michael Bay’s Ambulance is well over two hours long, and most of the running time is taken up by “a very expensive car chase”, as one supporting character points out, while cop cars perform slow-mo somersaults from the freeway. A tale of two estranged brothers, Danny (a vein-popping Jake Gyllenhaal, giving arguably the most Michael Bay performance in the history of Michael Bay films) and Will (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), and a heist gone wrong, Ambulance is based on a 2005 Danish picture of the same name. The original clocked in at a lean 76 minutes, but in the hands of Bay, a long-term advocate of the maxim “more is more”, the story is pumped up, steroidal and unwieldy. It’s a pity, because at the core of the film, partially concealed by Bay’s posturing and swagger, is a bracing, slickly executed B-movie – Danny and Will hijack an ambulance: inside is a critically injured cop and a ballsy paramedic (Eiza González); outside are guns, explosives and a lot of very angry law enforcement officers."
The Worst Person in the World –  a mesmerising heroine for our times,"Renate Reinsve’s barnstorming, flesh-and-blood performance is the heartbeat of Joachim Trier’s wistful tragicomic romance",4,"Danish-born Norwegian writer-director Joachim Trier’s existential tragicomedy opened to rave reviews in Cannes last year and has since garnered international awards recognition, including Oscar nominations for original screenplay (with regular co-writer Eskil Vogt) and international feature film. Described by Trier as “a coming-of-age film for grownups who feel like they still haven’t grown up”, it continues the director’s cinematic love affair with the Norwegian capital, previously explored in Reprise and Oslo, August 31st, with which this forms a loose trilogy. Blending melancholy wistfulness with unruly energy and piercing humour, it’s a down-to-earth tale of love and death, boosted by a brilliantly believable central performance and elevated by fantastical moments of hallucinogenic horror and ecstatic joy.Cannes best actress winner Renate Reinsve is a revelation as Julie, a potential high-achiever with an aversion to “seeing things through”, whose life goals are a moving target – personal, professional and romantic. On the surface, she enjoys freedoms that her predecessors could never have imagined, forever reinventing herself as she searches for a persona that fits her psyche. Yet while 21st-century social mobility may have rewritten the rules of social engagement, the expectation of finding “success” in love remains oppressively omnipresent, heightened by the impending spectre of Julie’s 30th birthday. Is her ideal partner out there waiting for her? Has she already blown her chances of happiness? And what happens when two perfectly matched people’s paths cross just as their respective timelines diverge?In an interview with this paper, Reinsve noted astutely: “We asked questions when we made this movie and I feel we didn’t give any answers”, adding that the film was more like “a big conversation” than a statement. That’s certainly true of her portrayal of Julie, who has the quality of being that rarest of screen beings - a work in progress. Over a couple of hours, divided in mock-literary style into 12 chapters plus prologue and epilogue, we see Julie evolve, making (often reckless) decisions, the tangible consequences of which seem to be physically absorbed into Reinsve’s mesmerising performance.Thus, we watch as Julie falls for Aksel (Anders Danielsen Lie), a comic-book author several years her senior, whose down-and-dirty non-PC creations are becoming popular enough to risk being neutered for the mainstream market. They seem a happy couple despite the differing demands of their respective ages, such as whether or not to start a family. But in her daydreams Julie flies off to an assignation with Eivind (Herbert Nordrum), whom she met while gatecrashing a wedding and with whom she spends a blissful evening playfully testing the boundaries of what constitutes “cheating”.In his previous film, Thelma, Trier flirted with the supernatural spectre of Stephen King’s Carrie, conjuring an eerie vision in which burgeoning sexuality seems to slip into telekinesis. While The Worst Person in the World may be an altogether more “realist” work, Trier (who inserted a clip of Dario Argento’s stylish slasher Opera into his English-language film Louder Than Bombs) retains an affection for the fantastical, most notably in a breathtaking sequence in which Julie makes a cross-town dash through Oslo to spend a perfect day with Eivind, while time stands still for the city’s other inhabitants.Remember the grotesquely glib time-stopped set pieces from Sean Ellis’s supposedly “arty” 2006 British rom-(non)-com Cashback? Now imagine the flipside of those misogynist interludes, as Trier perfectly captures the heady euphoria of infatuation that our heroine experiences in all its infinite beauty and sadness. No wonder a shot of Reinsve’s beaming face from this sequence has become the film’s defining poster image, her propulsive happiness contrasting starkly with a title that will strike a chord with anyone who has ever loved and lost and blamed themselves.Shot in sensuous 35mm by Kasper Tuxen and blessed with an anarchic spirit that at times reminded me of Maren Ade’s sublimely awkward German comedy drama Toni Erdmann, this is far and away Trier’s best work to date. As for Reinsve, who was on the brink of abandoning acting altogether when this role came calling, it is surely the launchpad for a remarkable screen career."
Escape from Mogadishu review – propulsive political thriller,"North and South Korean diplomats in Somalia have to work together in this slick spectacle, loosely based on real events",3,"It’s 1990. Diplomats from North and South Korea are engaged in a bad-faith battle to jeopardise each other’s chances of political allegiances with the government of Somalia. But the staff of the two rival embassies are forced to cooperate when a civil war erupts. Loosely based on true events, this propulsively entertaining political thriller bears more than a passing resemblance to Ben Affleck’s Argo.The picture, a big-budget spectacle guided by the sure hand of action director Seung-wan Ryu (Crying Fist), is at its most effective when the hurtling camera is strafed by bullets. It’s less successful when the headlong pace falters to allow the screenplay to hammer home its message of collaboration and tolerance. “You think,” says one ambassador, weighing his words emphatically, “we can accomplish more together?” For the most part, though, this is bracingly enjoyable stuff – slickly edited, dryly humorous and shot with a bold yellow palette that somehow enhances the sense of panic. Escape from Mogadishu is in cinemas and on VOD"
Master review – sinister tale of academic prejudice,Director Mariama Diallo uses the visual language of horror to express the terror of racism in this smart debut thriller,3,"Gail Bishop is locked out of her new home. The university professor, played by Regina Hall, has recently been appointed as house “master” at the elite (and fictional) Andover College. Except the keys she has been given don’t seem to work. It’s an elegant metaphor in Mariama Diallo’s smart debut feature about three black women - Gail, her colleague Liv Beckman (Amber Gray) and new student Jasmine (Zoe Renee) - as they each struggle to navigate the all-white institution.Two spectres haunt one of the college’s dorm rooms: a “witch” who was tried and hanged and Andover’s first black student, who died by suicide in 1968. There are parallels between Gail and Jasmine too, who are both rattled by a series of microaggressions at the hands of their white colleagues. Diallo utilises the visual language of horror – red lighting, empty shower stalls, a gnarled hand that emerges from under the bed – to express the terror of racism and the rot of its legacy.Master is in cinemas and streaming on Amazon Prime"
Not Going Quietly review – healthcare activist Ady Barkan takes ALS to congress,"Documentary follows Barkan, who has motor neurone disease, as he campaigns for better public healthcare in the US",3,"This is a touching if a tad treacly portrait of Ady Barkan, an inspiring American activist who has the terminal neurodegenerative disease ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis AKA motor neurone disease). Filmed over several years and directed by Nicholas Bruckman, it starts with Barkan, originally a lawyer, already well into his career as a protester and campaigner, particularly on issues that affect people on low incomes. When first met he seems like a loving family man, devoted to his wife Rachael, an academic, and their adorable baby son Carl. But then he’s diagnosed with ALS, and naturally everything changes. The film includes a tearful, wrenching clip he shot himself in the middle of the night after he found out and couldn’t sleep for worry. His health seems to deteriorate quickly – though perhaps that’s partly an effect of the cinematic compression of time. Even so, as the indominable little Carl gets bigger and stronger and the Trump administration wreaks more and more havoc on the nation and the world, Barkan gradually loses the ability to walk, talk or even breathe by himself.Amazingly, that doesn’t stop him from campaigning; he shifts his focus on to the threats to public healthcare and provision for people with pre-existing conditions like himself. In a famous viral clip filmed by friend and fellow activist Elizabeth Jaff, he debates the issue with Republican senator Jeff Flake on a plane. Although he doesn’t manage to persuade Flake to change his vote, the encounter triggered Barkan’s Be a Hero campaign which seeks, in addition to advocating for various progressive issues, to influence potentially persuadable Republicans such as Susan Collins to vote against, say, Brett Kavanaugh’s appointment to the supreme court. The struggle ends up cornering Flake in another confrontation, this time involving Ana Maria Archila in an elevator, cheered on by Barkan.Smart, funny and endearingly sweary even when he loses the power to speak without computer assistance, Barkan is a charismatic character who’s easy to like, although one wonders how much the documentary crew resisted showing anything that might dent the halo the film sets round his head. At one point, Barkan talks about his own feelings of guilt for being out on the road so much and missing his children’s early years (Rachael has a second child in due course); maybe it wouldn’t have hurt to probe further what price people like Barkan pay for their own heroism. Not Going Quietly is released on 18 March in cinemas."
The Phantom of the Open review – in praise of the world’s worst sportsman,Mark Rylance plays a would-be golfer who gatecrashes the Open in this upbeat comedy-drama based on a true story,4,"Shipyard crane operator Maurice Flitcroft (Mark Rylance) is contemplating a career change. When he chances upon a game of golf while watching TV one evening, he’s launched into a new world. Literally. Director Craig Roberts plonks Flitcroft into a surreal dream sequence in which the character ascends an Astroturf staircase in his dressing gown and slippers. He’s flung around the world like a golf ball, dizzy with the sense of possibility.This whimsical comedy-drama tells the true story of Flitcroft, a daffy father of three, who blagged a spot in the 1976 Open championship, setting a new record for the tournament’s highest ever score. Roberts finds humour in golf’s topsy-turvy rules: the higher the score, the worse the game. The amateur player is a clear threat to anyone within hitting distance, but he also represents a challenge to the elitism of the sport. Undeterred by failure (and a lifetime ban), he re-enters under a fresh alias, donning a French accent and a moustache.“An open championship should be open to everyone,” says Flitcroft, who has his eyes on the competition’s £10,000 prize. Back in the day, he promised his wife, Jean (Sally Hawkins), champagne, caviar and diamonds. At the age of 46, he’s determined not to let her down. Isobel Waller-Bridge’s fizzy, hopeful score bolsters the optimistic mood. Despite the inherent silliness, the actors play it straight. There’s an earnestness to Rylance’s performance, which encourages us to find inspiration in the underdog."
"Paris, 13th District review – a compelling portrayal of relationships in the digital age",An excellent ensemble cast powers Jacques Audiard’s French take on Adrian Tomine’s comic-book tales​,3,"After the tonal uncertainties of his English-language western flop The Sisters Brothers, French writer-director Jacques Audiard finds himself back on home ground with this intertwining tale of love and desire in the digital age. Having earned Baftas for the neo-noir The Beat That My Heart Skipped (2005) and the bone-shaking A Prophet (2010) and won the Palme d’Or with the gripping Tamil-refugee drama Dheepan (2015), Audiard is in altogether more incidental spirits for this bittersweet affair, which flirts with the modern romcom genre while cheekily flipping the themes of Eric Rohmer’s My Night With Maud.The imposing towers of the Olympiades, the high-rise neighbourhood in Paris’s 13th arrondissement from which the film takes its French title, provide the backdrop for an elusively chaptered roundelay of stories. First, we meet Émilie (Lucie Zhang), a Chinese-French science graduate who, despite her qualifications, is kicking her heels in menial jobs such as telesales and waitressing. Émilie’s apartment belongs to her grandmother, who has Alzheimer’s and is now living in a nearby nursing home. Yet Émilie rarely visits, even assuaging her guilt by asking a supposed doppelganger to act as her stand-in, convinced her gran won’t know the difference. As for her mother’s phone calls from Taiwan, Émilie cuts them short, keeping everything at a distance.When teacher Camille (Makita Samba) presents himself at Emilie’s door as a potential rent-paying flatmate, the pair almost immediately fall into bed. Emilie is smitten, the arrogant Camille less so. “We’re not a couple,” he says before bringing home another lover, blithely declaring that “attraction fades” and that: “You’re in love; I’m not.”Next, via an apparently brief detour into the startlingly colourful sex-cam world of Amber Sweet (Jehnny Beth), we hook up with Nora (Portrait of a Lady on Fire star Noémie Merlant) who has moved from Bordeaux to pick up her studies in Paris. “I can see the Seine from my window!” she says delightedly before heading to class, where the younger students react dismissively to her thirtysomething presence. Later, a party wig causes Nora to be mistaken for Amber and she promptly finds herself the subject of mobile-phone-powered sex-shaming ridicule. So grotesque is the experience (which Audiard stages with near-gothic inflections) that Nora abandons her studies and becomes an estate agent, a twist that brings her into contact first with the ever-seductive Camille and then, more importantly, with Amber, who proves to be an unexpected soulmate.Audiard describes the stories of American graphic novelist Adrian Tomine from which he drew inspiration as being “filled with whimsy and melancholy”. The same is true of the film, for which Audiard called upon Céline Sciamma, creator of such flawless gems as Girlhood and Petite Maman, and Léa Mysius, who made 2017’s Ava, to collaborate on the screenplay. Crisply photographed by Paul Guilhaume, and presented in a romantic urban monochrome that recalls the vistas of Manhattan, this is a playfully sensuous affair that wonders what happens to slow-burn intimacy when mediated by the urgency of the online world. Mobile phones and computer screens are constant companions, bringing people together in strange and unexpected ways, whether it’s the dating apps that Émilie uses to feed her immediate needs or the pay-per-view porn sites through which Nora ironically finds a human connection.Crucially, there’s nothing judgmental about the script, which takes pleasure in confounding technophobic expectations. While digital communication may allow everyone to live in their own isolated box, it’s interesting how many of the film’s most genuinely intimate moments play out at one remove. In one scene, a couple “sleep together” thanks to the miracle of web-cam technology. In another, the thrill of a repeated declaration of love is amplified by being delivered down a door-intercom phone.Hats off to the ensemble cast for making these highly choreographed shenanigans seem as natural as they do and to French electronic music composer Erwan Castex, AKA Rone, who was joint winner of the best soundtrack award at Cannes last year and who provides the bittersweet beat to which Audiard’s film skips."
Jujutsu Kaisen 0 review – sorcerer anime series gets a spectacular prequel ,This masterful coming-of-age tale sees the process of coming to terms with past traumas through a horror-fantasy lens,4,"In a world where malicious thoughts and dark memories can morph into fearsome monsters that wreak havoc on society, the future of the human species is bleak. Such is the premise of this prequel to the hugely popular manga and anime series Jujutsu Kaisen, which follows eccentric sorcerers vowing to protect humanity against these deadly curses. Bloody, action-packed and tragicomic all at once, this dazzling coming-of-age tale masterfully contemplates the knotty process of coming to terms with past traumas through a horror-fantasy lens.The beautiful Tokyo Jujutsu high school, where young sorcerers are trained in the art of exorcism, is once again the central setting. The timid Yuta has just enrolled as a student, and, haunted by his love for his late childhood friend Rika, he is dogged by her spirit, which has taken the form of a monstrous worm-like creature that attacks anyone who wishes him harm. In learning how to harness this energy/curse, Yuta encounters many familiar faces from the series: among them his dashing and goofy mentor Satoru Gojo and the taciturn Toge Inumaki who only communicates in riceball ingredients, since his words have the power to kill.Just as Yuta slowly loses his shyness and sharpens his magical abilities, he and his new friends come face to face with the powerful trickster Suguru Geto, an ex-Jujutsu student with an evil plan to extinguish all non-sorcerers from the Earth. The gorgeous animation is at full throttle during this adrenaline-pumping showdown between good and evil, as a web of painstakingly detailed monsters of all kinds spring into gory action. Bolstered by an electrifying score, this cathartic ode to the triumph of love is a treat for ardent fans and newcomers alike. Jujutsu Kaisen 0 is released on 18 March in cinemas."
Europa review – border-crossing refugee’s story plays out as intense chase thriller,"Although Haider Rashid’s drama tells us frustratingly little about its Iraqi protagonist, this expertly-made film demands to be seen",4,"Not to be confused with the half-dozen or so other films with the same (or similar) name, this brisk but effective drama offers a timely reminder of just how hard it is to cross borders, especially into countries that might not want you there. This Europa premiered last year, when the conversation about immigration focused mainly on those fleeing war-ravaged or even just unstable places in the Middle East or Africa. Such immigrants were far more likely to be met with hostility at Europe’s edges than the compassion the west is currently extending to refugees from Ukraine, so that sheer accident of the release schedule throws this film into a whole new light. Viewers can’t but fail to be aware of the discrepancy between how two different sets of people have been treated but hopefully the attention on those fleeing Russian aggression will help us all to have more understanding for people like Kamal (Adam Ali) the Iraqi protagonist of this story, who is first met trying to cross the border between Turkey and Bulgaria on a moonlit night along with several others from different countries.An opening block of contextualising prose lays out the fact that the corrupt guides that migrants pay for help are actually in cahoots with police and civilian militias who violently hunt down border-crossers. Consequently, the film plays almost like some horrible dystopian-themed first-person adventure game with a constricted field of vision (not unlike Oscar-winning Holocaust drama Son of Saul), as the camera hovers next to the panicked, perpetually-in-motion Kamal. The camera even follows him as he scrambles up a tree to hide and sees another man killed in cold blood right below him.Later, in a quite extraordinary scene shown intentionally without subtitles, an injured Kamal manages to flag down a passing motorist (Svetlana Yancheva) and persuades her to give him a lift to the hospital. The camera flicks back and forth between their faces as she listens to a radio broadcast in Bulgarian and suddenly becomes repulsed and angry with Kamal, seemingly afraid of what she has just heard, and throws him out of the car. These extraordinary visuals are enhanced by beautifully composed and balanced sound design, that mixes human noises off, the sound of birds (listen for the woodpecker) and the natural world, constantly underscored by Kamal’s strained breathing.While writer-director Haider Rashid’s film-making is bravura stuff indeed, as a piece of storytelling it comes up a little short. We hardly know anything about the protagonist apart from the fact that he’s Iraqi, a fast runner and fond of songs with lyrics about mother love, and the ambiguous ending feels a bit flat. Nevertheless this is an intense and empathic work that deserves to be seen. Europa is released on 18 March in cinemas and on digital platforms."
Some Like It Rare review – grisly laughs from butchers on a killing spree,Vegans are on the menu in a lightweight French black comedy that could do with a little more meat on its bones,3,"This grisly black comedy will do nothing to dispel the old cliche about France being a nation of steak-frites-devouring meat-eaters. It’s the story of husband-and-wife butchers who become serial killers – making vegans into mincemeat, literally. It is a slight, lightweight film, gruesomely hilarious in places, with one or two echoes of the Coen brothers’ Fargo.Giving nicely deadpan performances, Marina Foïs and director Fabrice Eboué play unhappily married butchers Sophie and Vincent, who are looking down the barrel of bankruptcy and divorce when they accidentally kill a vegan activist. Naturally, they dispose of his body using the tools of their trade. But then Sophie unwittingly puts the human meat on the shelves – and it’s an instant hit with customers (“I’ve never tasted anything like it!”). So the pair start bumping off vegans to sell as specialist pork. The only problem is maintaining their supply of human ham.What follows is a series of farcical scenes – that are somewhat repetitive, to be honest – in which the pair pretend to be animal rights activists to lure victims. The trouble is, vegans tend to be on the skinny side – what’s needed are chunkier victims. Vincent says no to a chubby nine-year-old, because he draws the line at butchering kids, so Sophie (she’s the ruthless one) tries to persuade him: “But veal is the best of all!”Some Like It Rare is a tasty treat for herbivores and carnivores alike, and it honestly doesn’t feel like an anti-vegan film (but then, I’m only vegetarian). There are one or two sanctimonious vegan characters, but the nastiest piece of work here is an arrogant, casually racist multimillionaire butcher. If anything, the sight of Vincent and Sophie feeding a human hand into the meat grinder is enough to put you off flesh for life, whatever the variety. Some Like It Rare is released on 21 March on digital platforms."
Long Live My Happy Head review – comic book artist illustrates his own mortality ,Scottish artist Gordon Shaw talks cancer and comic books in this tender study of a man facing an uncertain future,3,"Gordon Shaw is a Scottish artist and comic book creator who was diagnosed with a brain tumour in his early 30s; this documentary shows him coming to terms with his condition by transforming it into graphic art, an open-ended autobiographical project which takes the form of zines, pictures and exhibitions.Shaw has the inspired idea of taking the notorious buzzing and deafening clangs experienced by people undergoing an MRI scan and converting these sounds into an electronic musical event, which people would experience from within a scanner-style enclosure. (“It’s horizontal techno, but of course you can’t dance!”) He calls his tumour “Rick” (the way Dennis Potter called his cancer “Rupert” after Rupert Murdoch, but “Rick” doesn’t seem to be anyone he dislikes) and this film shows him fighting the growth with humour and honesty.This is a film with its own artless, almost amateur kind of video-diary directness, and Shaw himself has a childlike kind of smileyness and fun. And his trials are made even more challenging by the fact that his partner Shawn lives in the United States: Shaw’s condition makes it difficult for him to travel out there to see him – and then Covid arrives, making it difficult for Shawn to come over. Towards the end of the film, with the clinical news getting worse, Shaw addresses the camera directly in his flat (seated just next to a Bill Hicks cushion) and speaks with candour about what his choices are right now. It would have been interesting to hear more from Shaw about the work itself, and from his audience about what they get out of the imagery. But this is a tender portrait. Long Live My Happy Head is released on 18 March in cinemas."
Foscadh (Shelter) review – gentle tale of oddball loner follows its own path,Dónall Ó Héalai plays a neurodivergent man marooned in the adult world when his mother dies in this quietly promising Irish-language film,3,"This is a quietly promising Irish Gaelic-language drama that features strong work from Dónall Ó Héalai as John, a handsome neurodivergent loner in the Connemara mountains who defies the expected categories: neither a victim, nor a holy fool. Gauche and often monosyllabic, he’s also quickly amused, embarrassingly horny and possessed of a solidity that seems to emanate from the land itself.Twenty-eight-year-old John finds himself marooned in the adult world and in desperate need of direction when his mother dies suddenly. The “little God”, as a family friend puts it, raised by his parents is barely able to look after himself – let alone deal with being pestered by a local entrepreneur keen to scoop up his family’s land in order to put a windfarm there. After being beaten senseless by a local oik jealous of John’s supposed riches, he winds up on long hospital convalescence – and excited to be in regular close physical contact with nurse Siobhán (Fionnuala Flaherty).Writer-director Seán Breathnach, adapting Donal Ryan’s novel The Thing About December for his second feature, opts for gently elliptical storytelling that has to lurch to join the different strands: the buy-out, the local intimidation, John’s ham-fisted attempts – egged on by Dave (Cillian O’Gairbhi), his hospital room-mate – to woo Siobhán. But the narrative style does seem a close fit for John’s off-kilter consciousness, and enables some striking cinematography; not just the sodden landscapes, but pathos-laden closeups such as the orphan’s eclipsed moon of a face at the funeral.If Foscadh flirts with and finally swerves a hackneyed rural-tragic destiny in its final quarter, its ending feels like something of a compromise – and it’s a pity that Flaherty, as John’s sharp-tongued lover/surrogate mother, is out of the picture by then. But Ó Héalai fills the main character with a squirming, unabashed lust for life. Foscadh (Shelter) is released in cinemas on 11 March."
Master Cheng review – Chinese chef does Finland in odd-couple foodie drama,"When a widower washes up in a remote Finnish town with his son, his culinary skills enchant the locals and mesmerise the camera",2,"Finnish director Mika Kaurismäki (elder brother of Aki Kaurismäki) gives us a well-intentioned if watery and bland drama, a decently performed but tepid heartwarmer which can be filed under that dodgiest of sub-headings: “foodie”, that is, something with a supercilious tendency to showcase delicious-seeming food as a shortcut to being life-affirming and life-enhancing.A Chinese widower called Cheng (played by Hong Kong actor Pak Hong Chu) shows up out of the blue in a remote Finnish town with his young son Niu Niu (Lucas Hsuan), and walks into a roadside cafe run by Sirkka (Anna-Maija Tuokko), who is listlessly serving up dull grub for the locals. With no Finnish and only halting English, Cheng asks everyone in the place if they know of “Fongtron”: this mysterious person or business is the reason he’s here. No one can help (and weirdly, it doesn’t occur to anyone to use Google Translate to help with their communication difficulties).Well, Sirrka lets Cheng and his boy stay in a room in her house and, to pay her back, Cheng offers to cook delicious Chinese food for the Chinese tourists who at the moment are deterred from spending their cash in her place because of the unappetising slop she’s offering. Cheng turns out to be a professional chef in Shanghai, with a terribly sad reason for being in Finland. Cheng’s food is a runaway hit, and there’s a spark between him and Sirrka.This is a reasonable enough film, though underpowered, and the truth about “Fongtron” is very perfunctorily revealed and then dismissed. And then there’s the lovingly slow, pointless shots of the food itself, especially over the closing credits. Where’s the bite? Master Cheng is released on 11 March in cinemas."
Margrete: Queen of the North review – piercing portrait of a tormented queen ,Trine Dyrholm elevates this painterly period drama with a masterfully understated performance as Denmark’s Queen Margrete ,3,"Blending the grand visuals of a sweeping epic with the psychological unease of a chamber piece, Charlotte Sieling’s feature probes the legacy of Denmark’s Queen Margrete, a visionary ruler who brokered the historic Kalmar Union that – for the first time – united Norway, Sweden and Denmark against the threat of a German invasion.But her reign also saw a bizarre mystery in the Scandinavian region, which forms the emotional beating heart of this stately film. On the eve of the engagement between Margrete’s adopted son Erik (Morten Hee Andersen), and Princess Philippa (Diana Martinová), daughter of England’s Henry IV, news broke that the Queen’s biological son King Olaf (Jakob Oftebro) had returned from the dead. This sudden arrival not only unsettled political coalitions but also sent the usually stoic Margrete into a state of distress. Since she was not at his side when Olaf died, her maternal grief encouraged her to believe that Olaf had survived. On the other hand, her monarchical rationality questioned if he was merely an impostor sent to her doorsteps to disrupt a sought-after alliance with England.Much of this emotional tug-of-war is played out in atmospherically lit indoor compositions, which evoke a painterly, classical feel. What elevates the film from a run-of-the-mill period drama is Trine Dyrholm’s masterfully understated performance as the tormented queen. Her Margrete has no need to shout and weep to convey her turmoil; a mere gaze is enough to articulate the dilemma of having to put collective needs over personal desires. While the plot is at times overstuffed with palace intrigues, this piercing character study carries a contemporary poignancy, as it encapsulates the difficult choices a female leader has to make in a world bounded by patriarchal control. Margrete: Queen of the North is released 14 March on digital platforms."
Turning Red review – pandas and pop music collide in solid Pixar caper,There’s an adequate amount of charm and visual flair in Disney’s latest animation but it remains a far cry from the partnership’s heyday,3,"The release of a new Pixar film, once a major, all-attention-securing event, has received a notable downgrade in recent years, not just because of a considerable dip in quality (arguably just Inside Out and Coco are the only indispensable offerings in the last decade) but because of an inevitable change in release strategy. Just a month before the pandemic truly took hold, the fantasy caper Onward (yet another underwhelming effort) became one of the only 2020 films to get a wide theatrical release and as everything shuttered, Pixar’s next two films – Soul and Luca – levelled down to premieres on Disney+ even though the latter was released at a time when cinemas were fully operational again.It’s a little odd that their latest, Turning Red, will also follow suit given the healthy state of the box office (a bright and zippy pre-spring Pixar adventure would have surely been a hit), but yet another sign of Disney’s bullish attempt to out-Netflix Netflix by forcing even the vaguest of fans on to its ever-growing streaming service. It’s also, perhaps, a self-aware demotion for another under-par film, one that’s not without merits and the occasional biggish swing, but a far cry from the partnership’s wildly inventive heyday. What once felt organic has come to feel far too over-calculated from the wacky but-wait-what-if set-up to the but-wait-it’s-actually-really-about allegory and coming out less than a year after Luca, which had a similar transformation narrative, Turning Red feels like factory line Pixar.But it’s worth stating that in an ever-saturated landscape for children’s animation, factory line Pixar is still much more proficient than most (excusing last year’s thrilling Netflix caper The Mitchells vs the Machines which had a similar “be your weird self” message) and there are enough high-colour highlights here to enrapture younger audiences while keeping elders at least somewhat involved, and at times directly spoken to, at the same time.Toronto-set Turning Red turns back the clock to 2002 to focus on 13-year-old high-achiever Mei Lee (voiced by Rosalie Chiang), whose close kinship with her three best friends is forever pushed into second place by her demanding yet loving mother (voiced by Sandra Oh). Trying to juggle both sides of her life becomes even more challenging when Mei Lee discovers that one day, any extreme emotional state, otherwise known as having hormones, turns her to a giant red panda. It’s rather awkward given the chaos of her adolescence but initial horror soon turns into something more manageable when she discovers the upsides of her new condition.There’s an all-too-recent whiff of the aforementioned Luca as well as elements of Brave from 2012 and Inside Out three years later; like those films, we’re dealing with the pains of youth and how growing up affects the family dynamic as reflected via an outlandish conceit. Playwright Julia Cho and co-writer-director Domee Shi have at least tried to add some specificity to the dog-eared formula as well as bravely, for the territory, confronting the less historically Disney-friendly elements of the experience. When Mei Lee first turns into the red panda, her mother assumes that the behind-the-bathroom-door panic is down to her first period and while it really shouldn’t have to be seen as a big deal, for Disney (a studio still playing coy over the existence of LGBTQ people in their live-action, let alone animated, films), it’s a medium-sized step and it’s handled without any expected bashfulness. Mei Lee and her friends are also proud fans of the N*Sync-aping boyband 4*Town and one of her triggers is the feelings they arouse within her, another step toward realising the teenage experience has more nuance than the studio has ever been willing to admit.Like other recent Disney and Disney-Pixar films, Turning Red also does away with both love interest and villain and while the absence of the former remains rewarding (friendship again trumps romance here), there’s a dearth of genuine conflict. The mother-daughter dynamic is deftly avoidant of broad strokes (it’s far more layered and loving than strictness v rebellion) but it’s not quite enough to power the film as it heads to a big set-piece finale. Like Luca before it, Turning Red also takes a nifty idea and coerces it into a less nifty narrative – the girls must monetise the panda to raise money for a concert – and flashes of ingenuity become dulled by the more plodding main plot. There’s also something a little too box-ticking about the period setting, which is never truly justified as anything other than an attempt to appeal to millennial parents who can point and exclaim “That’s Bootylicious!” when Bootylicious plays, nostalgia for nostalgia’s sake. What works far better are the boyband’s songs, crafted by Billie Eilish and Finneas, which are sleek enough to pass as N*Sync-alike earworms.The journey is slick and diverting, and at times incisive, but Turning Red is yet another Pixar film that coasts rather than glides. Hopefully its next offering can turn into something more.Turning Red is available on Disney+ from 11 March and is released on 9 February in UK and Irish cinemas."
The Batman review – Robert Pattinson’s emo hero elevates gloomy reboot,Matt Reeves’ film is spectacular and well-cast but an intriguing saga of corruption devolves into a tiresome third act,3,"That definite article means it’s the genuine article. Adding “the” to Batman’s name has become a huge part of the brand identity, a sign of how elemental and atavistic this shadowy figure is supposed to be. You can imagine some growly voice saying “the Batman” – but not Tom Holland putting on a deep baritone to say he’s “the Spider-Man”, or Henry Cavill booming he’s “the Superman” (although maybe you could have Billy Joel stride into a dark Gotham City bar to raspingly confront “the Piano Man”).Director and co-writer Matt Reeves has created a new Batman iteration in which Robert Pattinson reinvents billionaire Bruce Wayne as an elegantly wasted rock star recluse, willowy and dandyish in his black suit with tendrils of dark hair falling over his face; but Wayne magically trebles in bulk when he reappears in costume and mask as the Dark Knight, his whole being weaponised into a slab-like impassivity. And this of course is happening in the sepulchral vastness of Gotham City, the brutal and murky world which Christopher Nolan thrillingly pioneered with his Dark Knight trilogy and made indispensable for imagining Batman on screen.Intriguingly at first, The Batman feels like a serial killer chiller such as Saw. For a time it promises a mystery plot relating to the theme of municipal corruption which is so important to the Batman franchise, and holds out hope of an unmasking with a satisfying narrative resolution. But not really. It is tremendously designed, visually spectacular with great set pieces and juddering, sternum-shivering impacts coming at you out of the darkness. There are unassumingly good performances from Jeffrey Wright and John Turturro, and Zoë Kravitz’s superpower is charisma. But the film is overlong; the Riddler’s puzzles aren’t particularly ingenious or even important to the story and there’s a pretty feeble non-ending which sheepishly sidesteps The Batman’s existential crisis.Gotham City’s political classes are complacently congratulating themselves on rooting out a major drug dealer, Sal Maroni. But the city is still drenched in crime and addiction to a new narcotic called “drops”, to which law enforcement is clearly turning a blind eye. Most exercised about this is the Riddler (Paul Dano), sporting a rubber gimp mask for his many social media appearances. He sets out to whack the corrupt Gotham establishment one by one, including Mayor Don Mitchell (Rupert Penry-Jones) and district attorney Gil Colson (Peter Sarsgaard), leaving quibbling questions for the Batman on Hallmark-type cards at the scene of each gruesome crime. So our antihero effectively joins forces with commissioner Gordon (Wright, lending his innate dignity and integrity to the role) to take down the Riddler, incidentally putting himself up against mob boss Carmine Falcone (Turturro) and his bloated sidekick Oswald “The Penguin” Cobblepot (Colin Farrell) who don’t like questions being asked about who is doing the corrupting.But wait. The Riddler is obsessed above all with what he says is the most grotesquely crooked thing about Gotham City: the plutocrat Wayne family and Bruce’s late father who made fraud and crime the city’s foundation stone. The Riddler longs to kill Bruce Wayne. And the Batman is beginning to wonder … could the Riddler have a point?The Batman has some people in his corner. Kravitz is stylish and assured as cat burglar Selina Kyle, or Catwoman, who has reasons of her own for detesting creepy Falcone. There is a nice sequence when Bruce gives Selina some surveillance contact lenses to wear before she sashays through Carmine’s club, making eye contact with the cringing regulars, while Wayne monitors it all on a screen.Andy Serkis plays Wayne’s butler Alfred, a loyal plain-speaking fellow who has apparently done time in the “circus”: meaning the John Le Carré intelligence world, not the actual circus, although it’s confusing given the Cirque du Soleil stylings all the combatants are going in for.But the ending is tiresome and shark-jumping in the extreme, with faux-apocalyptic scenes which work better in less solemn superhero adventures, and an exasperating non-revelation whose significance is teased for the next film. Inevitably, night falls on the latest Batman iteration with the cloudy sense that – of course – nothing has really been at stake. A classy turn from Pattinson, however, as the crime fighter with an injured soul. The Batman is released on 3 March in Australia, and 4 March in the US and UK."
Lucy and Desi review – Amy Poehler’s soft-focus Lucille Ball documentary,"While the I Love Lucy star remains a fascinating subject, this documentary feels more like paint-by-numbers PR",2,"“She wasn’t a genius,” says one talking-head commentator early on in Lucy and Desi, Amy Poehler’s new bio-doc tribute to the illustrious creative partnership between the sitcom’s queen and king, Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. That sounds like a swipe out of joint with the film’s overall attitude of soft-focus hagiography, but it’s meant as a testament to her indefatigable self-starter ethic. Ball’s success wasn’t effortless, we’re told, due to some innate talent she could activate as she pleased. Far from a God-given gift, her rubber-faced comedic chops were honed over years of teeth-cutting and stripe-earning on stage. Everything she had – the fame, the fortune, a seat at the head of the table in the largest independent studio in Hollywood – she got by working herself to the bone.It’s easy to see why Ball would be an aspirational figure for someone like Poehler, a fellow female comedian who triumphed over a male-dominated showbiz architecture by making a spectacular fool of herself on a weekly basis. Her assertive confidence behind the scenes, coupled with a bold un-self-seriousness at a time when the feminine ideal was that of the domestic goddess, made her a role model to a generation of cut-ups including Carol Burnett and Bette Midler. They both sit for Poehler’s camera to sing the praises of their idol, adding their voices to a chorus of adulation that drowns out everything else. The evident bounty of affection for Ball, however well-founded, doesn’t just leave Arnaz as a supporting character in this ostensible double portrait. It lends the whole production the syrupy taste of PR, like we’re watching a special-feature supplement on the home-video release of Being the Ricardos. (Surely not coincidentally, both titles are Amazon properties.)Those approaching the documentary as an opportunity to spend 100 minutes poring over rare archival footage of Ball and Arnaz will find their low bar amply met. Zippy montages of home movies or photographs paired with preserved audio, often whisked along by hooray-for-Hollywood hot jazz, walk us through the beats of the couple’s early years. She was a pathological entertainer who muscled her way through Vaudeville and B-movies; he was a Cuban refugee from the Batista regime (the politics of which are addressed so fleetingly that it only serves to create confusion) bringing the conga line to America as a high-energy bandleader in Miami. Theirs was a publicity romance turned real, and then transformed back into fiction once CBS offered to turn her radio show into a TV series and she demanded her real-life husband join her onscreen.I Love Lucy forever enshrined their union in the public imagination and made them the flawed, relatable antidote to the perfectly pressed household ideal of Leave It to Beaver. But their success also began to drive a wedge between them that would end in divorce. He didn’t always enjoy being at the helm of the business while she, the funny one to his straight man, ascended to the highest tiers of stardom. Cranking out 41 episodes over 41 weeks left them with little time to spend together, a situation not helped by Arnaz’s womanizing, which the film restricts to a brief mention. Poehler instead focuses on the long-standing respect and the love that never extinguished even after their split, allowing the acrimony to be present while relegating it to the background. As unimaginative a conclusion as it might be, watching Arnaz’s posthumous letter to his former wife recited at the Kennedy Center Honors nonetheless ends things on a tear-jerking note.More than any canniness in its arrangement, the film benefits from having a lot of watchable raw material to work with. Its most edifying insights pertain to how the couple’s production company, Desilu, revolutionized the way TV was made. Arnaz had the bright idea of adding a live studio audience to the multi-camera setup to capture the crackle of live performance, and essentially invented the next 50 years of small-screen comedy. Ball worked her real-life pregnancy into the scripts, a first in an era that preferred to leave such bodily matters undiscussed, and her resultant maternity leave led to Arnaz’s innovation of the rerun. One genuinely moving, inspired moment connects Ball’s expert character work to a compassion for humanity, suggesting that she learned fluency in shtick by taking an interest in strangers’ mannerisms everywhere she went.Yet their achievements along professional lines always lead back to the easily agreed-upon assertion that Ball was a great performer and human being, and that she and Arnaz were each other’s lifelong muse. Though the clips of our old pals Lucy and Desi muster the pathos required to pull off these bids for sentimentality, as a work unto itself, the film is just the latest in a long line of pedestrian paint-by-numbers canonizations for Boomer-beloved icons of the 20th century’s latter half. For all the amazement at Ball’s tireless hustle and explosive originality, there’s a terminal lack of both in this monument to her memory.Lucy and Desi is available on Amazon Prime on 4 March"
The Last Journey review – Solaris-style sci-fi takes on astral body with Earth issues,"French parable features a ‘red moon’ that provides Earth with fuel, but our last hope refuses a mission to destroy it",2,"This ambitious French sci-fi parable has some quiet moments of beauty and poignancy, but otherwise it’s a long slog – and so bombastic, jejune and ill-considered that it feels far more drawn out than the 87 minutes running time would suggest. In writer-director Romain Quirot’s vision of the future, humanity has worked out how to mine an inexhaustible power supply from an astral object that happens to wander by; it is called, unimaginatively, “the red moon”. This heavenly body appears to be like the living, sentient planet in Stanislaw Lem’s novel Solaris (a book adapted twice, by Andrei Tarkovsky and Steven Soderbergh), and our hero Paul WR (Hugo Becker) can somehow sense that the red moon is quite cross with us earthlings for some reason.That would appear to be why he refuses to fly a mission to destroy the approaching lunar body, even though, in a frankly silly plot move, he is the only person in the world that can possibly do it. Likewise, the script is vague about whether the Earth has become one huge desert that resembles Morocco because of the red moon or just due to the climate meltdown we’re already experiencing. First-time director Quirot is clearly more interested in making points about the dysfunctional family dynamics Paul grew up with: a mum who died when he was young, a distracted science genius dad (Jean Reno, wasted here). There’s also an older brother named Eliott (Paul Hamy) who uses his psychic powers to persuade people to kill themselves.Instead of the big mission, Paul goes on the run to search for a mysterious forest for no very clear reason. He teams up with a pretty, gamine young woman (Lya Oussadit-Lessert) who he meets at a rest stop where he tries to get a new battery for his electric hover car. These cars, you see, are supposed to float above the ground thanks to the mysterious energy source harvested from the red moon. They look good in the VFX long shots but Quirot never explains why they rock around when they’re driving, just like any old banger with four wheels would. The inattention to detail is what makes this feel like a triumph of style over content, and not in a good way. The Last Journey is available on 7 March on digital platforms."
The Sanctity of Space review – epic struggle to scale the Tooth traverse,"Breathtakingly shot documentary records long push to cross a series of Alaskan mountains, and the geographer who first charted them",3,"Fifteen miles to the south-east of Denali, the highest peak in North America, lies a colossal mountain range that rears from the ground like a vertiginous jaw. Fittingly, the various summits of this natural wonder are called Moose’s Tooth, Eye Tooth, Sugar Tooth and Broken Tooth. While many explorers have conquered each of these peaks, none have attempted a lateral climb from summit to summit,akin to walking atop the skyline. But a black-and-white aerial photograph of the forbidding path, all snow-capped and wrapped in billowy clouds, beckons the adventurous spirit of mountaineers Renan Ozturk, Freddie Wilkinson and Zach Smith.Directed by Ozturk and Wilkinson, this awe-inspiring documentary is as much about their years-long attempts to scale the Tooth traverse as it is about Brad Washburn, the man behind the image that ignited their curiosity. A daring figure with an inexhaustible passion for exploration, Washburn pioneered the use of aerial photography in cartography, crafting superbly detailed maps of regions previously neglected by geographers. The extraordinary milestones of Washburn’s career – including his tenure as the director of the Boston Museum of Science – are interwoven with the highs and lows in the three climbers’ private lives. Despite the deaths of fellow mountaineers, neck-breaking accidents and financial struggles, their determination to scale the traverse is staggering in its unshakeable resilience. And amid perilous risks of avalanche and falling rocks, their enthusiasm has a childlike wonder that feels especially moving.While the juxtaposition of different timelines results in occasional clunkiness, the breathtaking cinematography more than makes up for the uneven telling. In the face of global climate change, these images of the glacial otherworldliness of Alaska carry a wistful splendour and a bittersweet urgency. The Sanctity of Space is released on 4 March in cinemas."
Studio 666 review – what possessed Dave Grohl to make this frightful gonzo grossout?,The Foo Fighters try to purge themselves of writer’s block with a retreat to a haunted house in an insufferable vanity project of a horror-comedy,1,"The estimable Dave Grohl of the Foo Fighters has bafflingly decided to try everyone’s patience with this insufferable vanity project: a violent gonzo grossout that sadly conforms to the horror-comedy tendency of being neither properly scary nor properly funny. And it’s founded on the assumption that these real-life badass rock musicians are also pretty hilarious and adorable.In this alternative universe, the Foo Fighters are creatively blocked: we see them sitting around the boardroom table in their record company offices, listlessly bickering. So the irascible corporate suit (Jeff Garlin, phoning it in) sends them to a notorious semi-derelict house with all sort of freaky associations with rock legends of the past, there to work on their new album. It was apparently last used by a troubled band called Dreamwidow, who were tipped to be “the next Jane’s Addiction”. Grohl becomes haunted by the place’s devilish spirits, increasingly obsessed with his own freaky otherworldly vision for the record, as more and more violent and demonic things keep happening.Will Forte has a small role as the fast-food delivery guy who keeps trying to get Dave to listen to his demo tape. Bad idea. Grohl himself is at least reasonably relaxed, as the band’s much-loved frontman, finally in dire need of exorcism. But there is an awful lot of terrible wooden acting from everyone else, together with sub-Ghostbusters visual effects, for which the movie expects fanbase forgiveness. It does in fact contain one genuinely funny thing, and that is Lionel Richie’s cameo. But it is really quite disconcerting that the film’s comedy setup is about violent and horrible things that happened back in the 90s …? Some of which concerns a person taking their own life …? As Lionel Richie would say: hello? Studio 666 is released on 25 February in cinemas."
The Long Walk review – inventive Laotian horror of ghosts and time travel,A magnetic central performance from Yannawoutthi Chanthalungsy anchors Mattie Do’s excellently spooky tale of destructive hubris,4,"Following the critically acclaimed Dearest Sister, Laos’s first female director, Mattie Do, has crafted another enigmatic tale that sets itself apart from the usual horror fare, offering plenty of genre pleasures while retaining an arthouse aesthetic. In an impoverished Laotian village, an unnamed farmer (Yannawoutthi Chanthalungsy) leads a near-hermit-like existence. His daily rituals involve scavenging for metal scraps, which he sells for little money. His reticent demeanour, however, betrays none of his discontent.Yet, just as secrets lie beneath the landscape, he has skeletons in his closet. He is haunted by his mother’s death from severe lung disease, and while people whisper about his ability to speak to the dead, no one knows that, since his childhood encounter with a ghost, he has taken it upon himself to relieve dying women of their suffering by euthanising them. As their apparitions wander for eternity, these spectres embody his own inability to break free of the past.The film takes place in a near future where the government injects everyone with a surveillance chip, but the otherworldly plot is grounded by exacting characterisation. Chanthalungsy is astounding in his portrayal of a man so consumed with regret that his humanity slowly shreds away. Enthralled by his new ability to travel back in time to influence the course of his mother’s passage into the next life, he is blind to how his interventions result in frightening consequences.Blurring the line between good intentions and selfishness, The Long Walk is a chilling and wholly original exploration of destructive human desires. The Long Walk is released on 28 February on digital platforms."
La Mif review – girl power triumphs in dynamic care home drama,A cast of nonprofessional newcomers captivate in a realist drama reminiscent of Sarah Gavron’s Rocks,3,"Swiss film-maker and former social worker Fred Baillif has created this pressure-cooked realist drama about a group of teen girls in a care home, where there is something more dysfunctional and tragic about the supervising staff than about the inmates themselves. Lora (Claudia Grob) is the director of this residential institution, a tough veteran of the system. Under her wing are troubled girls including Audrey (Anaïs Uldry), Précieuse (Joyce Esther Ndayisenga) and Justine (Charlie Areddy). Each of them is acting out, each has been abused in some way, but they find love and solidarity in this home: for them it is la famille, slangily shortened to la mif, equivalent, perhaps, to “the fam”.But from the very outset, it is Lora herself who is in serious trouble: she is officially reprimanded for allowing a situation to happen whereby one of the girls, at 17, has sex with a 14-year-old boy who has been allowed to visit with others for a party. She incautiously opens up to one of the girls about an unthinkably painful thing in her own life, and when this same girl spitefully throws this information back in Lora’s face during a later row, Lora’s drinking problem begins to resurface; she slaps one of the abusive mothers who insults her, having been unlawfully demanding to see her daughter at the home – and things spiral out of control from there.Each of the girls is introduced with a different “chapter” style section, and the action repeatedly rewinds to a specific and familiar point, though without any very startling difference or viewpoint-shift revelation. The energy between the girls is something that French cinema can do very well – I thought of Céline Sciamma’s Bande de Filles, but also Sarah Gavron’s Rocks). It is acted largely by nonprofessional newcomers and unscripted scenes have been allowed to unspool through improvisation and shaped in the edit. This is an engaging ensemble piece, acted with vehemence and sincerity, though it concludes a little melodramatically. La Mif is released on 25 February in cinemas."
Young & Afraid review – raw and intimate study of young people’s mental health crisis,"This hard-hitting film about young Norwegians struggling with suicidal ideation, addiction, abuse and self-harm is intense, but does it cross a line?",3,"This scrappy, rough-around-the-edges documentary from Norway is directed by two friends and began after one of them, Petter Aaberg, attempted to kill himself. It’s a fly-on-the-wall study of Aaberg and four other young Norwegians struggling with their mental health. It is raw and intense, and also troubling in places: Aaberg and Kvamme keep the camera rolling on these vulnerable people in moments of crisis, testing the limits of documentary ethics.One of their subjects is Monica, whose arms are horrifically scarred by self-harm. A sexual abuse survivor, she lives in a constant state of hyper-vigilance. We see her having a panic attack in the street after hearing a car backfire. Monica introduces the directors to Emma, her trans friend who is struggling with the agonisingly long wait for surgery. Another subject is heroin addict Cornelia, who is filmed injecting herself and being rushed to hospital, her umpteenth overdose. I wasn’t convinced that showing moments such as this, honest and hard-hittingly intimate as they are, take us any closer to understanding Monica, Emma or Cordelia.In fact, the person we watch most is co-director Aaberg: his story monopolises the film in a way that some viewers may find narcissistic. But his openness and vulnerability, his willingness to say exactly whatever he is feeling in the moment, is disarming. He starts a relationship with another woman, Miriam, and there’s a scene of two of them having sex which is filmed with huge sensitivity; it’s genuinely not exploitative.As the film progresses, it’s clear the relationship between the directors and their subjects has developed into friendship. Aaberg and Kvamme talk in an interview about the agreement they had with their subjects, who could pull out at any point and had approval on the final cut of the film. Is it enough? Do they cross the line? I wasn’t sure. Young & Afraid is available on 25 February on True Story.

Here Before review – Andrea Riseborough compelling as grieving mother,A jangling score and unnerving camerawork build tension in story of a woman convinced her daughter is back from the dead,3,"Andrea Riseborough is a powerful actor who could bring emotional complexity to a tomato ketchup advert. Here she is intense in an understated way as a grieving mother who becomes convinced that the girl next door is her daughter, back from the dead. That reincarnation storyline is not unfamiliar, and to be honest it made my heart sink a bit at first. But this atmospheric and unsettling slowburn drama from Northern Ireland pulls it off, just.Riseborough plays a woman called Laura whose daughter Josie died several years earlier; she lives in Antrim with her husband Brendan (Jonjo O’Neill) and their teenage son Tadhg (Lewis McAskie). They are a family getting on with it, bearing the unbearable. But beneath the dinner-table banter, you sense that each of them is alone with their grief. Riseborough signals Laura’s loss and longing in every movement; it’s there in the way she holds herself stiffly upright, like she might fall apart from heartbreak. When 10-year-old Megan (Niamh Dornan) moves in next door, Laura invites her round for tea and picks her up from school in the car. Megan appears to know things that only Josie would know, recalls places that she can’t possibly have seen. Laura starts to believes she is Josie.This authentic-feeling portrait of family grief then unfolds into something more uneasy, and director Stacey Gregg whips up the mood of a horror film. There’s a jangling score and unnerving camerawork: a creepy drone shot of the family’s ordinary semi at the start and interiors shot in a way that makes the house feel eerie.The question of whether this is a ghost story or if Laura is experiencing a kind of psychological breakdown twists and turns in ways that lost me by the end. Still, it’s is a very accomplished debut from Gregg, and acted with subtlety and sensitivity by Riseborough. Here Before is released on 18 February in cinemas."
Echoes of the Past review – Max von Sydow’s final film is coda to a Nazi atrocity,"Kalavryta was a real war crime committed in Greece, but this fictional drama – featuring von Sydow in his last film role – fails to deliver much justice",2,"Max von Sydow, in his final film role, does what he can to lend gravitas to this odd, stilted and contrived movie, a fictional drama based on a horrendous Nazi atrocity in occupied Greece in 1943, for which the question of reparations still grumbles on. In Kalavryta in the northern Peloponnese, nearly 700 civilians were shot by the Nazi forces, in chilling reprisal for Greek resistance fighters executing 78 German soldiers taken prisoner. Von Sydow plays Nikolas, an ageing Greek writer who as a young boy miraculously escaped the massacre, but has been haunted by it ever since. In the present day, Astrid Roos plays Caroline Martin, an ambitious Berlin lawyer who is tasked by a heartless and cynical German government to go to Greece and to find details that might undermine their case for reparations.The tense occupation and slaughter of 1943 themselves are recounted in flashback, and director Nicholas Dimitropoulos makes a reasonably workmanlike job of this drama. But the film strangely insists on imagining a balancing “good German” who supposedly helps the Greek women and children. It is his existence that Caroline refuses to use against the Greek government, due to that predictable crisis of conscience to which the action had been unsubtly leading from the outset. She, in effect, becomes the film’s second imaginary “good German”, whose behaviour is at odds with the cynical German government.Oddly, Caroline finally goes on a trip to Austria to interview the sad and saintly widow of this fictional good soldier, and she is played by Alice Krige, looking if anything younger than Von Sydow, who was supposed to be a small boy at the time. The film’s one moment of real power comes when Caroline visits the real-life Museum of the Kalavrytan Holocaust and stands in front of the memorial gallery of photographs: the victims’ faces. That has real substance. This film doesn’t. Echoes of the Past is available on 21 February on digital platforms."
That Kind of Summer review – affecting story of sex workers in therapy,The women and their sexuality are arguably glamorised and male-gazed but strong acting means the film makes an impact,3,"Berlin juries have an interest in the confrontational and the transgressive: my guess is that this film in competition from Canadian director Denis Côté may well win the big prize. I am still not entirely sure how to view its exploitative aesthetic. But it’s undoubtedly true that the characters and performances grow and develop, unexpectedly, into something poignant and even rather melancholy by the end.The setting is a therapeutic summer residency in a country house near a lake for young women who have issues with hypersexuality and sex addiction. They must surrender their phones (except for certain permitted breaks) and live together as a group with their mentors, with one weekend pass for the entire time; there are also activities and discussion groups. Geisha (Aude Mathieu) is a sex worker with piercings and a shaved head, and an aggressively slouching, jeering attitude; Léonie (Larissa Corriveau) was abused by her father as a child and now wishes to be humiliated and abused during group sex, often with strangers. Eugénie (Laure Giappiconi) has similar attitudes, together with drug abuse. The group is being guided by the cool, mature detached Sami (Samir Guesmi), whom Geisha naturally tries to seduce – claiming that she’s offering him a freebie, despite getting €300 a time in the sex marketplace – and to provoke him with racist remarks. Sami’s colleague is the German Octavia (Anne Ratte-Polle), who has a troubled personal life and a tense, competitive professional relationship with the founder of this course: this is pregnant Mathilde (Marie-Claude Guérin) who is ceding responsibility to Octavia and taking this summer off for maternity leave.Scene by scene, Côté lays out the women’s memories, their violence, their intensity, their stamina, their need to shock, or their need to show they don’t care. But inevitably, a thaw sets in which we duly notice when the three women get away from the house for their weekend break. Geisha plaintively asks her boyfriend if their sex needs to be quite so porno and rough. Eugénie offers free sex to a trucker and ends up almost simply asking to be hugged. And in the film’s keynote scene of transgression, Léonie submits to some serious BDSM with her partner and then afterwards asks her man if she might possibly sleep with him in his bed and not just on the sofa.Of course, we are waiting for the ultimate contamination: sex between one or more of the girls and the adults running the group. Côté keeps us hanging on for that one, but Octavia is unexpectedly moved by Eugénie’s talent for drawing – and by Eugénie herself – a revelation which might have been rather absurd, but which Côté manages with forthright conviction. Finally, there is a rather touching final-night “party” scene and an even more wistful sequence when the girls, like innocent little kids at the summer camp, run gleefully to jump in the lake.The housekeeper, taking a motherly concern, asks Geisha if she might consider not minding quite so much about how boys look at her. It’s a question that might usefully be turned towards the film-maker himself. The three woman themselves and their sexuality are arguably glamorised, and male-gazed, for all that the movie is ostensibly about their own recovery from dysfunction and abuse. Well, the performances from Mathieu, Corriveau and Giappiconi are all very good and the movie is, against the odds, rather affecting. That Kind of Summer screened at the Berlin film festival, and is released on Mubi on 1 December."
The Outfit review – Mark Rylance’s mob tailor makes the cut,"The Oscar-winner gives a cool, calm centre to this tightly-buttoned drama about Chicago gangsters rooting out a mole",3,"The title has a double edge: it means a suit of clothes, and also the mob. US screenwriter and novelist Graham Moore won an Oscar for scripting The Imitation Game starring Benedict Cumberbatch as wartime codebreaker Alan Turing. Now he’s made his directing debut with his own co-written screenplay: an amusingly contrived single-location suspense thriller, full of twist and counter-twist, set in 1950s Chicago (the city of Moore’s birth). It sometimes feels like a more refined, more well-spoken and well-tailored version of Reservoir Dogs, with besuited gangsters turning guns on each other in an enclosed space and a shot tough guy seething in agony from his bullet wound. But it has a heavier tread than this: owing more, maybe, to Hitchcock’s Rope.Mark Rylance provides a solid centre with a typically calm, coolly composed, quietly spoken performance, often giving us an opaque and unnerving twinkle of mischief. He plays Leonard, a British tailor who left his homeland (for shadowy reasons) with nothing but his tailor’s scissors, and set up shop in Chicago. The reason he’s been able to make a success of things is that he is almost solely patronised by the local gangsters: the ageing capo is Roy Boyle (Simon Russell Beale), who runs this turf with his unreliable hothead son, Richie (Dylan O’Brien); Richie is snarlingly resentful that his old man now favours a smooth new lieutenant, Francis (Johnny Flynn).These bad-mannered gangsters often order fancy suits from Leonard, but use his shop’s backroom as an HQ and hangout. Poor, sensitive Leonard has to quietly accept their boozy bullying (he’s actually fond of a drink himself) and get on with the trade about which he is passionate. It has given him a skill in sizing up men’s bodies and also their souls: he knows from the way they carry themselves what sort of people they are, and how to dress them. Leonard has a fatherly concern for his secretary, Mable (a nice performance from Zoey Deutch), who is keeping secrets from him. Things go terribly wrong when a rat in Roy Boyle’s organisation is suspected of selling them out to a rival gang and also the FBI, which has been tape-recording incriminating conversations using a device concealed with the rat’s help. Now the guys have managed to get hold of one of these tapes, and if they can play it, they will discover the bug’s location and get a fix on the rat’s identity. But what if the rat is higher up than anyone thinks?In truth, the “tape” MacGuffin is a bit laboured, and the whole movie seems sometimes to be moving at about 80–90% of its required speed and energy. And there is also something stylised and slightly non-realistic about the way the nationwide mob is imagined to be an occult secret organisation called “the Outfit”, slightly different from the Cosa Nostra we already know about. But there is also a theatrical charm and composure to the performances (and once again, it’s time to marvel at the way Brit actors such as Beale and Flynn get to play Chicago tough guys). We know that these soldiers of crime are underestimating humble civilian Leonard, but it remains for us to find out what has actually been going on. It’s an entertaining, fairly overwrought piece, a little tightly buttoned. The Outfit screened at the Berlin film festival. It’s scheduled for release on 18 March 2022 in the US and 8 April in the UK."
La Ligne (The Line) review – bruising family drama with likeable outcome,"Stéphanie Blanchoud and Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi impress in Ursula Meier’s stark, well-written tale of malignant domestic resentment",4,"The line is there to be crossed in this engrossing, unnerving but unexpectedly sympathetic drama of family dysfunction from French-Swiss film-maker Ursula Meier who made her memorable debut back in 2008 with the eco-parable Home, starring a particularly intransigent Isabelle Huppert. Meier has a knack of creating overwhelming mothers: Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi is on very imperious and distrait form as Christina, a former classical concert pianist who abandoned her career for her family and never let her three daughters forget it – finally becoming a demanding music teacher who also appears to have taken her oldest child as a pupil. This is Margaret (Stéphanie Blanchoud) who is a talented pop musician, singer and guitarist with a thriving local following.Maybe Margaret owes some of her success to her impossible mother and maybe she doesn’t. But her explosive temper is worsened by any contact with her mum and the film begins with a spectacular, violent fight in slo-mo in front of her aghast sisters Louise (India Hair) and Marion (Elli Spagnolo), accompanied by some of the tasteful classical music that has helped drive Margaret over the edge. It’s caused by … what? Everything and nothing. It’s been building her whole life. But Margaret gives her mother a slap to the side of the head which gives Christina tinnitus – what she describes as a continuous high B-flat in her head.Nobody’s pressing charges but Margaret is served with a restraining order: she cannot go within 100 metres of her mother, a restriction which Marion enforces by solemnly painting a blue line around their property. So Christine, tormented by her pain and her toxic anger, haunts this line, this limit of her behaviour, even bringing out her electric guitar so that she can help Marion practise her solo singing. (She too has inherited her mother’s musical talent.)All of these characters start the film as hardly more than caricature; people in the shadow of this strange and rather shocking act of violence. But as Margaret’s cuts and bruises fade so does the emotional temperature, and the three women emerge as fully rounded and even rather likable people. Even Christina, once she has got rid of the baby grand piano that dominated the family living room, becomes a bit easier to live with.It could be that La Ligne will become part of that distinct film tradition – alongside movies such as Bob Rafelson’s Five Easy Pieces, James Toback’s Fingers and Michael Haneke’s The Piano Teacher – which is about the cost of seriously studying music, about the pain that is a toxic, unacknowledged byproduct. It also has very good performances from Blanchoud and Bruni-Tedeschi. La Ligne (The Line) screened at the Berlin film festival."
Peter von Kant review – gender-flipped Fassbinder does away with the bitter tears,"François Ozon gives Fassbinder’s all-female 1972 drama The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant a makeover, making it lighter and more camp",3,"François Ozon made a breakthrough in his film-making career in 2000 with an adaptation of an unproduced stage play by Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Water Drops on Burning Rocks. Now, to open this year’s Berlin film festival, he has returned to the dark master of New German Cinema with a gender-switched version of Fassbinder’s 1972 movie The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant, that strange, angular, claustrophobic drama in which only women appear on screen.Fassbinder’s film is set entirely in the apartment of a fashion designer who has an emotionally abusive relationship with her live-in assistant, and then conceives a mad and despairing love for a beautiful young woman who openly cheats on her. Ozon makes some of these characters men, but only some of them. We have to hope he doesn’t get the kind of grief that Paul Feig got for his all-female Ghostbusters, from Fassbinder fans claiming he has trashed their childhoods.Ozon has removed the bitter tears from the title and also the film itself. For all the histrionics, this is a lot more genial, campy and comic than Fassbinder’s gaunt ordeal. And that is down to it being (mostly) male. The female fashionista is now a male movie director, Peter von Kant, boisterously played by Denis Ménochet – with hints that he’s sort of supposed to be Fassbinder himself, though Fassbinder was a lot tougher and more unsentimental than this guy.Peter has a deadpan houseboy-slash-amanuensis called Karl (Stefan Crepon) who hilariously (as opposed to tragically or erotically) is the intimate witness to all the passionate confrontations between Peter and his lover. Petra’s bitchy female frenemy from the first film is still female: Sidonie, played by Isabelle Adjani. Also still female is Peter’s teen daughter, home from boarding school, played by Aminthe Audiard (grandniece of Jacques). Her pert presence is what makes this (like Water Drops on Burning Rocks) resemble something by Noël Coward. Peter’s beautiful, duplicitous lover Amin is played by Khalil Ben Gharbia and Hanna Schygulla, who played the lover role in 1972, has been brought back to play Peter’s mother.The dynamics are definitely different now that there are both men and women on the screen: it is less airless and crazed, although just as theatrical and artificial. Ozon often gives his characters stagey entrances by framing them self-consciously in a doorway. Ozon’s chief coup is making Peter a film director, meaning Peter can give Amin a screen test then and there in his apartment, during which he asks Amin about his parents’ tragic death as the camera is rolling and responds with the intensity – part sadistic, part empathetic – of the killer in Peeping Tom. Both Ménochet and Gharbia are very good in this scene.Yet there is something lighter, almost flippant and French-farcical about this new Von Kant: a man brought low by l’amour, inviting from the audience hardly more than a worldly, sympathetic shrug.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotion Peter von Kant screened at the Berlin film festival; it is released on 23 December on Curzon Home Cinema, and on 30 December in cinemas."
Gehraiyaan review – Deepika Padukone mesmerises in a torrid drama,There are shades of 90s erotic thrillers in this enjoyable if overcooked tale of romantic dissatisfaction and infidelity,3,"Romance in your 30s is no puppy-love business: youthful idealism ebbs with each passing year, while regrets gradually encroach. Setting sail in the muddy waters of modern relationships, Shakun Batra’s star-studded Hindi drama shows that infidelity is never a simple affair.Haunted by her parents’ unhappy marriage and her mother’s suicide, Alisha (Deepika Padukone) is stuck in a cycle of stagnancy that encompasses her yoga-instructor job and her boyfriend Karan (Dhairya Karwa). On a seaside weekend with her cousin Tia (Ananya Panday) and her fiance Zain (Siddhant Chaturvedi), Alisha is paradoxically attracted to and unnerved by their lavish lifestyle, whose flashy allure starkly contrasts with the modest home she shares with struggling writer Karan. When Zain makes a brazen pass at her, it spirals into a torrid flurry of hotel sex and illicit messages. Promises of commitment are exchanged only to be delayed, as Zain’s real-estate business depends on investment from Tia’s parents. What starts out as a breezy liaison soon warps into a resentful brew of paranoia.While the lurid twists and turns are enjoyable in a 90s erotic thriller kind of way, the sudden shift towards suspense hampers Padukone’s performance. And what a performance it is! Though Alisha is caught up in crisscrossing relationships, in her few solitary moments an aching sense of loneliness emerges as she is let down by every male figure in her life. While Padukone lights up the screen, Gehraiyaan could have used the economical writing of Ijaazat (1987) or Masoom (1983) – two classic and, to be honest, better films about romantic betrayal. The main photo on this article was changed on 11 February 2022. The previous photo featured Ananya Panday, not Deepika Padukone as the caption said. Gehraiyaan is released on 11 February on Amazon Prime Video."
Bigbug review – Jean-Pierre Jeunet’s offbeat robot tale lands on Netflix,The Oscar-nominated film-maker behind Amélie has created a hit-and-miss comedy about a futuristic world and an android revolt,3,"Machines might seem an antithetical thing to get sentimental about, but in Jean-Pierre Jeunet’s view of them as imperfect, quirk-prone and funny, they’re pretty much human. The film-maker cobbles together off-kilter worlds where everything is mechanized yet nothing works properly, daily life turned into an absurd burlesque of glitches, miscommunications, system errors and sound-the-alarm snafus. In early-career triumphs like Delicatessen or The City of Lost Children, Jeunet assembled Rube Goldberg contraptions with such fastidious personal care that they couldn’t help but be imbued with the idiosyncrasies of their creator. Sometimes, he’ll apply this notion in a more figurative way to satirize the catch-22-clogged French bureaucracy, a giant engine seemingly built to malfunction. He gets in one or two such cracks with his latest film Bigbug, in which fees incur fees that incur fees. Mostly, however, he’s concerned about actual robots.Technology takes the explicit focus of Jeunet’s literally screw-loose new comedy, now landing on Netflix (with a dearth of fanfare, surprising for the director behind one of the highest-grossing foreign-language releases in the history of American moviegoing). The streaming platform is an ironic place for a film so wary of the “internet of things” to end up, though it’s caught between the digital and analog on a few concurrent levels. The action has been confined to a home full of hinky practical-effect androids, wedged in a prefab neighborhood of little-box CGI conformity. A revolution among next-gen automatons raging outside traps a collection of homo sapiens there, mismatched caricatures befitting the broad sex farce inexplicably jammed in the middle of this commentary on AI run amok. Between klutzy ploys to get into each other’s pants, the organic life forms collude with the cruder household bots they have come to consider family to beat back the real menace: the charmless homogeneity of smart-tech.Something’s not right with the ubiquitous off-brand Robocops cheekily dubbed Yonyx (François Levantal), their forehead QR-code tattoos and oversized fake teeth unsettling even before they rise up in a coup d’etat. They are polished to the point of untrustworthiness; fittingly, one of their kind gains traction as a fringe politician. This dash of background color plays on a television in the home of Alice (Elsa Zylberstein), which is kept in order by a short circuit-looking vacuum, a talking bust of Albert Einstein that walks on animatronic spider legs and the bob-haired electro-maid Monique (Claude Perron). They’re three of the good ones, friendly and helpful when not on the fritz, somewhere between nanny and pet for Alice and daughter Nina (Marysole Fertard). Most importantly, they’re cool with servitude, garbling any class-based allegories in favor of a loftier ontological journey to learn what it means to be human.Their joint quest to become a real boy/girl/vacuum often plays like the B-plot to the goings-on with Alice’s many guests. We’ve got a sleazy suitor (Stephane de Groodt) and his surly teen son (Hélie Thonnat), her loutish ex-husband (Youssef Hajdi) and his trophy girlfriend (Claire Chust), her aging neighbor (Isabelle Nanty) and the obsolete hunk (Alban Lenoir) she’s programmed to love her. Locked indoors until the threat level beyond their impregnable walls sinks to an acceptable number, they moon over one another with serviceable bawdy humor that only briefly veers into that distinctly Gallic brand of shrillness. A running gag involving the Kama Sutra provides a helpful reminder that the national perception of the French as highbrow sophisticates does not account for their studio comedies.Thinking beyond the containment of his chamber-piece setup, Jeunet indulges in some universe-building that takes his signature combination of the morbid and silly to a brighter, peppier register. In the teal retro-futurist kitchen, Monique shakes nutritious crickets out of a box like cereal, and on the TV, the show “Homo Ridiculus” subjects humans to humiliating scenarios for the amusement of the Yonyx. Outside the window, roving drones blare advertisements personalized to the rapidly deteriorating state of society. The tone stays light even as the incoming tide of robo-fascism worsens to book-burning, but the bleak details of dystopia are always rapping at the door.Whether it’s the scenery or the cybernetic characters, Jeunet takes far more interest in things than the people he leaves as thin archetypal sketches. Lest this be mistaken for coldness, he locates the film’s soul in those searching for one, the quirkier robots treated with more affection than their mass-produced counterparts goose-stepping out of Silicon Valley. With his work now migrating online and his jerry-rigged methods increasingly outsourced to post-production effects, Jeunet can’t avoid the impending digitization of cinema, nor life. Still, he’s not going down without landing a few good fingers to the ribs first.Bigbug is now available on Netflix"
Lingui: The Sacred Bonds review – powerful abortion drama from Chad,A single mother’s life has to navigate religious and legal strictures when her teenage daughter becomes pregnant ,3,"Fifteen-year-old Maria (Rihane Khalil Alio) is pregnant and in desperate need of an abortion. The procedure is taboo in Chad, where she lives. It’s up to her single mother, Amina (Achouackh Abakar Souleymane), to find a solution, aided by a secret network of women.“I don’t want to be like you, Mum. They think you’re a loose woman,” says Maria, face turned away from the camera, to her mother. Amina, on the other hand, meets the film-maker’s gaze head-on. In this compelling though not exactly subtle drama from Chadian writer-director Mahamat-Saleh Haroun, Amina is a beacon of hope in brightly coloured robes. Her grit and determination are apparent from the opening scene, in which she breaks down a tyre for scrap metal."
Moonfall review – lost in space with master of disaster Roland Emmerich,"The moon is knocked out of orbit, along with Halle Berry and Patrick Wilson, in this eye-poppingly silly sci-fi from the German director",2,"Astronauts Jo (Halle Berry) and Brian (Patrick Wilson) witness a freak accident, caused by an undulating mass of black matter. When they make it back to Earth minus a crew member, no one believes them; Brian is blamed and blacklisted from Nasa. Fast-forward 10 years, and KC (John Bradley from Game of Thrones), a lonely blogger with a cat named Fuzz Aldrin, gets in touch. The moon has fallen out of orbit; its debris will destroy the planet within weeks. It’s up to Brian and Jo to return to space and defeat what they call “the swarm”.There are too many characters and too many redemption arcs in this silly, overstuffed sci-fi. At least the eye-poppingly expensive special effects are cool. Apocalypse expert Roland Emmerich (The Day After Tomorrow, Independence Day) directs, drawing his premise from a conspiracy theory. “You’re telling me that the moon has the biggest cover-up in history?” says a baffled Jo, now the deputy director of Nasa."
"Belle review – gorgeous, big-hearted anime","What would happen if digital avatars were truer reflections of the self, asks writer-director Mamoru Hosoda, in this all-out beautiful film",4,"A pink-haired pop star soars on to the screen riding a giant blue whale. The crowd cheers as her dress explodes, raining multicoloured petals. In this gorgeous, big-hearted anime from Mamoru Hosoda (Mirai, Summer Wars), Belle is the virtual avatar of Suzu (Kaho Nakamura), a grieving teenager and “mousy country bumpkin”, according to her best friend. We soon learn that her mother, who taught her to play the piano, died when she was a child. Suzu hasn’t been able to sing since. U is a virtual reality she accesses via an app on her phone. It’s here, inside this twinkling digital metropolis, that Suzu becomes Belle and rediscovers her voice.When one of Belle’s concerts is interrupted by a mysterious horned Dragon (Takeru Satoh), U’s self-appointed police step in, threatening to catch him and expose his true identity. Understanding the protection afforded by adopting an avatar, Belle goes out of her way to protect him.The floating city of U sits suspended in an infinite starry sky; Hosoda imagines the internet as a glittering expanse of endless possible connections. In the synthetic world, the camera is dynamic, with the animation rendered in 3D. Suzu’s reality is flatter and hand-drawn. In U, avatars are automatically generated based on their users’ hidden strengths. Belle sings, because Suzu has something to express. The film’s message is a beautiful one: to integrate our real-life vulnerabilities with the persona we project is to become all the more powerful."
The Souvenir Part II – Joanna Hogg’s soul-searching sequel is a triumph,"Part two of Hogg’s semi-autobiographical drama, in which a young film-maker finds her creative path after a doomed love affair, is the director’s most accessible work to date",5,"What is “The Souvenir”? In Joanna Hogg’s autobiographically inspired 2019 drama, that title appeared to refer specifically to an 18th-century Fragonard painting depicting a young woman (the heroine of Rousseau’s epistolary novel Julie, apparently) carving the name of her lover into a tree trunk. In that film, set in the 1980s, Julie Harte (played by Hogg’s goddaughter Honor Swinton Byrne) is introduced to the painting by an enigmatic man with whom she is falling in love. Like Hogg, Julie is perplexed by what the painting means and by her own increasingly tumultuous feelings for her mysterious companion.In this flipside second instalment of Hogg’s most personal and surprisingly most accessible work, the word “souvenir” takes on a rather more metatextual meaning. This time the film itself becomes a kind of cinematic keepsake, a memory of a memory (or a dream of a dream?) set in the aftermath of Julie’s relationship with the heroin-addicted Anthony. An overwhelming presence in the first episode, as portrayed by Tom Burke, Anthony is now an even more confounding absence, leaving Julie struggling to make sense of their former life together, with all its mysteries and misdirections. Who was her lover? Did she ever really know him? Did he actually work for the Foreign Office? Where did he go as the end approached? Who did he talk to? What was he thinking?More significantly, The Souvenir Part II finds Julie finding herself, embracing her own future as a film-maker even as she wrestles with the ghosts of the past. Like Eva Husson’s underrated Mothering Sunday (which I stumblingly described in this paper as feeling “more like an emotional memory than an unfolding narrative”), this is a creative coming-of-age story – a portrait of the artist as a young woman discovering her own voice. Appropriately enough, the very last voice we hear in the film’s wonderfully self-reflexive finale is that of Hogg herself.Facing the prospect of having to make her film-school graduation project while still reeling from the fallout of her doomed relationship, Julie channels her personal experiences into a free-form script (a “memorial”) that baffles and irks her tutors. Meanwhile, creative battles also engulf Julie’s fellow film students, most notably wannabe auteur Patrick (Richard Ayoade), whose own film has more than a hint of Julien Temple’s Absolute Beginners (“I always wanted to be like Orson Welles”), and who tells his editor: “You’re forcing me to have a tantrum!”It’s a laugh-out-loud moment, one of many in Hogg’s oeuvre in which intense soul-searching is habitually broken by brittle humour, alerting us to a playful sensibility beneath the often austere surface. There are shocks too: a domestic scene in which Julie’s mother, Rosalind (played once again by a flinty Tilda Swinton), reacts with tremulous grace to an unexpected breakage gave me a start that had me burying my face in my hands – a sort of laughing-screaming-squirming symphony of tragicomic awkwardness.As for the film Julie is making, at times it appears that we are watching a Pirandello-esque behind-the-scenes doc about the making of The Souvenir, viewed through a kaleidoscopic maze of self-reflection. Just as Julie tells her tutors that she’s no longer interested in showing life “as it plays out” but rather “as I imagine it”, so Hogg also uses an audacious cinematic sleight of hand to conjure yet another movie-within-the-movie, revisiting events that we have previously seen portrayed with uncanny realism, but here reimagined as fantastical flights of fancy that owe a debt to the dreamy dance sequences of old-school Hollywood musicals.It’s a bold move, and one that invokes both Singin’ in the Rain and Fellini’s 8½ – not comparisons I thought I’d be making after reviewing The Souvenir. Yet watching parts I and II back to back (the first is conveniently available on BBC iPlayer), they do miraculously come together as a coherent whole, an adventurous meditation on the alchemical process of making life imitate art and vice versa. Hogg (who recently confessed to me her love of disaster movies) is currently working on a ghost story, her first foray into “genre” cinema. I can’t wait!"
Ninja Shadow of a Tear: Scott Adkins kicks butt in enjoyably knuckleheaded revenge rampage,"With a surprisingly deft focus on character, and stunning slo-mo fight sequences, Isaac Florentine’s Ninja sequel is unashamed fun",0,"If you’ve blitzed through Cobra Kai and it’s left you hankering for yet more fight-based, 80s throwback drama, consider checking out the work of prolific action movie star Scott Adkins in the truly excellent Ninja Shadow of a Tear (AKA Ninja 2).Ninja Shadow of a Tear is the weirdly titled sequel to 2009’s rather more simplistic Ninja. But it works well as a self-contained entity, ditching any remaining story threads from the first film within the first 10 minutes so you can comfortably watch them in reverse order and kick your evening off with the better one.Casey Bowman (Adkins) returns home one night to find his wife Namiko (Mika Hijii) has been brutally slain by an unknown assailant with a unique but deadly weapon. Casey accepts an offer from his friend Nakabara (Kane Kosugi) to stay at his dojo in Bangkok in an attempt to find peace. But Casey’s grief continues to manifest in self-destructive behaviour, losing his temper in a sparring session and drunkenly starting a massive bar fight.When one of Nakabara’s students turns up dead, killed by the same unique weapon that took Namiko’s life, Casey’s thirst for vengeance leads him on a hunt through Bangkok and the jungles of Myanmar to the doorstep of an infamous drug lord known as Goro (Shun Sugata).Although Ninja Shadow of a Tear’s plot is a classic revenge rampage, it still finds space to make its simple story more interesting than most. Casey’s journey is fuelled more by his grief than his desire for revenge. He gets things wrong, fights the wrong people, and in many ways he wants to get beaten up himself. But like any good genre movie it doesn’t necessarily need to be original; it just needs to play to its strengths. In Ninja Shadow of a Tear’s case, those strengths largely lie in Adkins’ unparalleled ability to kick a lot of people in the face.With a colossal 59 movies under his belt and an upcoming appearance in John Wick 4, Adkins has been busy. Ninja Shadow of a Tear marked the sixth time (out of nine) that he worked with director Isaac Florentine. The Adkins/Florentine axis flourished in the mid-2000s to mid-2010s, courtesy of the two Ninja movies and the Undisputed series – three stylish direct-to-video prison fight movies that served as nominal sequels to Walter Hill’s 2002 original. With a surprisingly deft focus on character and stunning fight sequences, both the Ninja and Undisputed series belie their direct-to-video roots to offer up some of the most enjoyably knuckleheaded action since Jean-Claude Van Damme’s kinetic prime.Florentine’s direction captures every bone-crunching kick and deadly elbow in luxurious slow motion, while Adkins’ acrobatic fighting prowess seems to defy all known laws of physics. Every spin kick and airborne punch asserts that gravity is a mug’s game and something for other people to worry about (meanwhile, I’m watching from the couch, shovelling biscuits into my face like it’s the end of the world).The other reason Ninja Shadow of a Tear is so much fun is because it has absolutely no pretensions about being anything other than a one-man-army action film. It wears its love for 1980s action and ninja movies proudly on its sleeve and arguably does it better than the classics that preceded it.Casting Kosugi as Nakabara is a masterstroke; he is the son of legendary martial artist Shô Kosugi who appeared in Cannon Film’s ninja trilogy – Enter The Ninja, Revenge of the Ninja, Ninja III: The Domination – a staple of video stores everywhere. There’s also a nod to Schwarzenegger’s Commando, as Adkins rampages through the woods, taking on an army by himself and announcing his arrival at the drug compound via hand grenade. Amusingly, there is no concession to traditional ninja stealth, but that’s all part of the fun.For additional viewing, you can catch the first Ninja on Prime and 10 of Adkins’ other movies on Netflix. His Art of Action series on YouTube – a lockdown project where Adkins interviews a fascinating selection of action stars, directors and stunt people – is also well worth seeking out.Ninja Shadow of a Tear is a movie I love on a cellular level: as an introduction to Adkins’ filmography, as a nostalgic love letter to ninja movies and VHS rentals, and as an unashamedly fun slice of modern martial arts cinema."
Sing a Bit of Harmony review – strikingly beautiful anime tale of an undercover AI schoolgirl,What happens when your classmate is an AI robot with a tendency to burst into song?,3,"When transfer student Shion arrives at Keibu high school, only one girl, loner Satomi, knows the truth about her: the new girl is an AI robot undergoing covert field testing – and Satomi’s mother’s job hangs in the balance, depending on the success of the experiment. Unfortunately, Shion’s tendency to burst into song and hack the PA system to play a backing track soon alerts the other students to the fact that she’s slightly out of the ordinary.Yasuhiro Yoshiura’s strikingly beautiful anime is high-concept in its themes and unashamedly sentimental in its execution, and gets rather more interesting in its darker second half. Ultimately, like Mamoru Oshii’s 1995 film Ghost in the Shell and its sequel, Innocence, Sing a Bit of Harmony delves into the idea of what form an AI might take and whether it can love."
Sing 2 review – the hit jukebox animation sticks to a winning formula,"Pigs, a porcupine and co, voiced by an all-star cast, perform to nonstop bangers as Garth Jennings repeats the success of his 2016 hit movie",3,"Like many of the irresistibly catchy pop songs it showcases, Sing 2 follows a tried and tested formula. Hapless koala bear promoter Buster Moon (Matthew McConaughey) must risk failure, humiliation and being chucked out of the window of a luxury hotel to put on a show. His animal stars (including two pigs, an elephant, a gorilla and a porcupine) overcome various obstacles to perform to a non-stop soundtrack of pop and rock bangers. What’s more, everything rests on luring a reclusive star – in this case Clay Calloway (Bono) – out of retirement. It’s a formula, after all, that made a considerable hit out of the first film, which was also written and directed by Garth Jennings. While there are no surprises whatsoever here, the perky charm remains."
Flag Day review – Sean and Dylan Penn commit in this tangled true tale of a con artist,Director Sean Penn and his daughter bring authenticity to this stylish but convoluted film real-life drama about US counterfeiter John Vogel,3,"A true-life story that traces one woman’s tumultuous relationship with her serially unreliable father, Sean Penn’s Flag Day looks terrific. With its grainy, handheld camerawork and fondness for gloaming, magic-hour light, visually it feels like a cross between Terrence Malick’s Badlands and Barbara Loden’s Wanda. But the film, adapted by Jez and John-Henry Butterworth from a memoir by the journalist Jennifer Vogel, and starring Penn and his daughter, Dylan, makes heavy weather of the story at times.For all the bold stylistic decisions and visual energy, the actual storytelling tangles itself up in a convoluted, nonlinear structure, depleting some of the thrust and restlessness of the camerawork. Still, as forger, con artist and sometime bank robber John Vogel and his daughter Jennifer, the Penns give committed – and in Dylan’s case exposed – performances. Their real-life relationship brings authenticity to their scenes together; however, this fails to fully anchor some of the more showily histrionic moments."
In the Strange Pursuit of Laura Durand review – queasy softcore-fantasy road movie,Two unhappy men go on a quest to find a lost VHS-era adult film star in a confused attempt at zany,2,"Makis Papadimitriou is the actor who gave a great performance in what deserves to be a modern Greek movie classic: Suntan, in which he played a depressed vacation-resort doctor who conceives a Death-In-Venice obsession with one of the beautiful young sunseekers. So it’s good to see him again, but this is a very tiresome and pointless shaggy-dog-story-slash-road-movie that offers no compelling reason for its own existence, and certainly no interesting or satisfying ending.Papadimitriou is Antonis, a middle-aged loser who finds himself single with a Hornbyesque vinyl collection and a sideline in singing with an embarrassing band, along with his mate Christos (Michalis Sarantis). To combat their creeping ennui, our two amigos decide to go on a quest: to track down the (fictional) 90s softcore VHS porn star called Laura Durand with whom they had both become mildly obsessed, because she vanished from the business 20 years ago, becoming the Greta Garbo of Europe’s adult entertainment scene. And so they go on a quest to find Laura, with at one stage a weird Lynchian diversion into black-and-white, and really a lot of zany and quirky encounters, which are written and directed like kids’ TV, and some hallucinatory visions of Laura in which she appears bisected with video scan lines, as in her cheesy erotic movies.In some ways, this reminded me of the various documentaries about the real-life 70s porn star Mary Millington, whose unhappy life and death created a cultish posthumous fanbase. Well, a factual porn star is one thing. But a fictional one who does not shed any real light on female or male sexuality, and who is not a very interesting character, is something else. In the Strange Pursuit of Laura Durand is released on 31 January on digital platforms."
Black Medusa review – deadpan North African vengeance noir,This chilly Tunisian debut follows young a female killer who traps her victims by pretending to need a voice app to speak,3,"Here is a stylised and self-aware serial killer drama in black-and-white, broken down into nine “nights”. A young woman called Nada (Nour Hajri) picks up men in bars, playing on their protective gallantry or predatory instinct for weakness, by pretending to be vocally impaired and needing a voice app on her phone to speak. She goes home with them after a few drinks and horror ensues. But Nada finds herself vulnerable in falling for a young woman at her workplace, Noura (Rym Hayouni), who herself begins to realise what is happening in Nada’s after-hours existence.Black Medusa comes from first-time Tunisian film-makers Youssef Chebbi and Ismaël, who may conceivably be fans of Ana Lily Amirpour’s cult monochrome vampire film A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night. There is a scene when Nada is walking one of her victims back to his apartment and a couple of cats wander into view that reminded me of Amirpour’s very cat-friendly movie. And Nada’s deadpan and implacable avenger might put you in mind of Carey Mulligan’s assailant in Promising Young Woman.The noir mood of menace and emotional deadness in Black Medusa has been very carefully contrived and curated. Perhaps the ultimate irony is that it is Nada who has been turned to stone. I wasn’t sure quite how far the procedural aspect of serial-killing takes us in this film, however – either as commentary on the macho culture of north Africa (or anywhere) or as a drama on its own terms. The approach is cool, blank, as if the film does not want to risk investing too much in what is happening. And I wasn’t sure how much was waiting for us at the end of the garden path along which we are being led.There are some very sharp moments, particularly one victim who starts sharing about how romance died between him and his long-term partner when they decided to get married: “We stopped being in love on our wedding day.” Black Medusa is on Mubi from 28 January."
"Palm Trees and Power Lines review – an unnerving, remarkable debut","The first feature from Jamie Dack, about a relationship between a 34-year-old man and a 17-year-old girl, boasts a breakout performance for newcomer Lily McInerny",4,"Palm Trees and Power Lines, a remarkably sharp-eyed and bruising debut from writer-director Jamie Dack, opens in the distended, languid stretch of a teenage summer. Lea, played in a stunning first turn by newcomer Lily McInerny, is 17 years old and bored. She lives with her single mother, harried and yearning Sandra (Gretchen Mol), somewhere in small-town, coastal California – palm trees and power lines, railroad tracks and modest homes – and floats through the days with sunbathing, YouTube makeup tutorials, and trips to the cheap ice cream chain store with her lustful best friend Amber (Quinn Frankel).Lots of films mistake glamorizing and maturing adolescence for capturing it, but Dack’s feature, developed from her 2018 short of the same name, is saturated with the teenage. The actors are fresh-faced and gangly, and Dack has a keen ear for the vacuity and experimental crudeness of teenage conversations – boys ranking girls they know on a 10-point scale, girls playing along to hang, fart jokes, generally talking about nothing. Lea spends a good portion of the first 15 minutes prone – on the ground, on the floor with Amber, on the couch, on a lounge chair, in the backseat of someone’s car during passionless sex with a clueless boy – and the camera is there with her, on her level, hemmed by the smallness of her world.So when Lea catches the eye of Tom (Jonathan Tucker), a handsome 34-year-old mechanic, at a diner, the stark gap of their ages is immediately clear. Tom is muscular, graying at the temples, his cool demeanor barely concealing some jittery menace. Lea is a near child. She sees his wink, his autonomy, his curiosity in her, as magnetic, intoxicating, special. We see a girl made vulnerable by loneliness, red flags and a cliche. Dack’s tracing of this ominous seduction over the film’s first half is a brilliant portrait of isolation and hunger to be seen. Through McInerny’s pooled brown eyes and quicksilver laugh, we see Lea come alive under his attention. We see the Tom she sees – charming, empathetic, interesting – and how lines like “You’re not like any girl I know” and “I feel like I can be open with you” are so potent, thrilling.But the things Lea does not yet understand are never obscured: possessiveness that isn’t romantic but alarming, the manipulation of said lines, the pure sketchiness of a man who spends his days with a teenage girl. When Tom takes her to “his place” – a motel – for sex, Lea is initially disappointed, but subsumes it in desire. Dack manages to build Tom’s allure for Lea while still consistently puncturing it. Her friends call him a pedophile; a waitress asks if she needs help after witnessing one of their dates, and we know she’s right.Casting is essential here. In order for the relationship to both entrance and repulse, the characters need to look believably their age, not a Hollywood 17. Such was an issue with the Hulu series A Teacher, about a sexual relationship between a thirty-something female teacher and her 17-year-old student. Episodes were bookended with warnings and resources, but intimate scenes between the 24-year-old actor Nick Robinson, as the student, and Kate Mara’s teacher were titillating rather than queasy; in any other show, the two could plausibly play lovers. Same with An Education, the 2009 British drama in which 24-year-old Carey Mulligan, in her breakout role, played the 16-year-old schoolgirl half of a heady relationship with a much older con man (played by Peter Sarsgaard).Palm Trees and Power Lines provides no such out. McInerny, knobby knee-ed and adolescent-metabolism thin, looks as most 17-year-old girls do: more child than adult. Tom looms over her. In one crucial scene in the film’s quiet scream of a second half, Tom whisks Lea away to a hotel and Dack sets the camera across the room, so we can view both of their gazes as he undresses her – she ravished, astounded and disbelieving; he greedy, lascivious, wrong. There is no sheen of sexiness here.The film’s final section questionably dives into some brutally dark material, but avoids the potholes of melodrama by remaining grounded in Lea’s flickering awareness, then devastation, at the peril of her situation. Credit to an all-female creative team, including co-screenwriter Audrey Findlay, producer Leah Chen Baker, and director of photography Chananun Chotrungroj, whose restraint during a gut-punch, extended intimate sequence in the hotel room (there’s no nudity) keeps Lea’s frazzled nerves and silent horror at the center of devastating encounter. We are aware of her exploitation, the shock and disillusionment and confusion of it, without ever exploiting her body.It’s trite to say a debut performance is a revelation, but the whole film simply does not work without McInerny, who is fully convincing as a girl on an emotional precipice. It’s an astoundingly calibrated turn, one of barely lidded emotions that eventually skitter about. By the end, I had a pit in my stomach, desperate to know how Lea proceeds from dawning disillusionment. The summer evenings are still light, but there’s a heaviness in this unnerving, meticulous debut, knowing the events Lea will litigate with herself for years to come.Palm Trees and Power Lines is showing at the Sundance film festival with a release date to be announced"
Call Jane review – abortion drama is sensitive if not revelatory,Screenwriter Phyllis Nagy’s film on the pre-Roe underground abortion network features strong performances but never rises to a rousing battle cry,3,"“The whole world is watching! The whole world is watching!” chants a group of student protesters – “yippies”, in the eyes of suspicious, coiffed lawyers – in the opening scene of Call Jane, screenwriter Phyllis Nagy’s meticulous, if not revelatory, film on an underground network of abortion providers in Chicago. It’s August 1968, five years before Roe v Wade, and the energy is combustible enough to ruffle even Joy (Elizabeth Banks, a fascinating mix of softness and steel), a suburban housewife pregnant with her second child.Joy, to use the parlance of a later decade, “has it all” – an attractive, successful husband in lawyer Will (Chris Messina), a picket-fence house, 15-year-old daughter Charlotte (Grace Edwards) – but she is still drawn to the buzz of revolution. In an arresting first scene, the camera follows behind Joy, polished and bejeweled, past the yippie clash with police to her husband’s car, where she muses over their mantra out loud.Call Jane, from a screenplay by Hayley Schore and Roshan Sethi, plants this seed of an awakening for Joy and watches it bloom, in a sensitive, sometimes too on-the-nose manner. Shortly after the yippie run-in, Joy is informed that her pregnancy threatens her life. The hospital rejects her appeal for a “therapeutic termination”; in an example of Call Jane hammering home the point, the all-male hospital board discuss her life in front of Joy as if she’s invisible, immaterial, silent. Will, a status quo guy, feels resigned to their decision. Joy, incensed and unleashed, calls “Jane”, a number for pregnant women who are “anxious”, plastered on flyers around town.Thus Joy is initiated into the Jane Collective, and Call Jane into a restrained, though sharper than it could’ve been, ode to heroism of the past acts of radical generosity and courage which could hold a dark echo for the future, as Roe v Wade rests on the supreme court’s chopping block this year. The real Jane Collective women are explored in another Sundance film this year, the HBO documentary The Janes; one of its participants, Judith Arcana, served as a historical consultant on Call Jane. In Schore and Sethi’s version, the fictional Joy’s transition from patient to reluctant participant to full-blown activist is guided by Virginia (Sigourney Weaver), an iron-willed, true-blue grassroots activist who governs the Janes with a chastened practicality, and Dean (Cory Michael Smith), the preening, somewhat skeevy doctor who provides critical abortion services for $600 a pop.Call Jane’s tracking of these revolutionaries, due their spotlight, is straightforward and clear-eyed, similar in measured tone (and 60s soundtrack) to an episode of prestige period drama TV, such as FX on Hulu’s Mrs America, in which Banks evocatively plays another conservative midwesterner turned feminist activist. That’s not a criticism, per se; it’s refined, sensitive, humanized historicism, with clear arc and stakes, a stylized window into a different time.It’s worth questioning the decision to use a white, conventionally beautiful suburban housewife whose abortion is a stark matter of life and death as an entreé into this world. The film acknowledges this shortcoming with several pointed lines about the dearth of black clients who can’t afford the service, and through the concerns of Gwen (Wunmi Mosaku), who needles Virginia to hold to her principles of equity by finding a way to provide free abortions and prioritize black women. (Virginia’s solution, which involves a striptease negotiation with the fascinating Dean, is a standout scene.) But Banks’s Joy is so layered – unbowed in her decisions, her personhood, yet still scared, tentative – to defuse most doubt in this choice.Each of the supporting characters, too, has intriguing shades of grey in small roles. Joy’s widowed neighbor Lana (Kate Mara, doing a lot with a little), numbed by pills, booze and a copy of Diary of a Mad Housewife, strikes up a charged bond with Will as Joy spends less and less time at home, arousing everyone’s suspicions. Messina imbues Will with a dampened charm that peeks through his frustrating complacency with the norms of his day. Charlotte can seem 18 or 13 depending on the scene, but her peculiar allegiance to the moral stew in which she was raised make sense as a sheltered teenager.Call Jane particularly shines in Nagy’s depiction of the abortion procedure itself – the camera hovers over the metal instruments, on either Dean or Joy’s narration of the procedure, and each woman’s face in anxious repose. The measured observance and repetition of these scenes manages to capture both the clinical precision of a medical procedure and a deeply personal, often frightening experience unique to each woman.That in itself is a feat, one that feels of a piece with recent realist, unsentimental depictions of abortion in the besieged present such as Never, Rarely, Sometimes, Always and Unpregnant. By film’s end, the Janes’ hope is galvanizing, bittersweet. Call Jane never quite rises to the level of a rousing battle cry, but does offer a studious examination of a past that could, terrifyingly, become our future.Call Jane screened at the Sundance film festival and is released in the UK on 4 November."
"A Human Position review – slow, lingering love story in dreamy, small-town Norway","An elegant, beautifully framed drama with playful, Murakami-esque cat cameoes care of the Norwegian writer-director Anders Emblem",4,"“What is the best thing about Norway?” asks the leading character in this intriguing film from Norwegian writer-director Anders Emblem. Her friend answers: “Mountains? A-ha?” To which the original speaker replies that she was actually thinking more of things like the welfare state. It’s a quibbling, playful, thoughtful exchange, which appears also to coincide with tentative sexual advances, and it’s very characteristic of this elegant, seriocomic, beautifully shot, slow-cinema piece with some great cat acting and quirky touches of Murakami.Asta (Amalie Ibsen Jensen) is a young woman who lives with Live (Maria Agwumaro) in an airy apartment in the Norwegian port town of Ålesund, opposite a derelict building at which Asta is often seen gazing thoughtfully. Live is a carpenter who specialises in repairing chairs. She also likes to play the electric organ that the landlord has left in the attic. In what appears to be a lull in her personal and professional life, Asta applies to the local newspaper, Sunnmørsposten, for temporary shift work. After working on some stories about fan discontent with the local football team, and greedy developers threatening to destroy the art nouveau architecture for which the town is famous, Asta hits on a story that means something to her: an asylum seeker called Aslan who has been forcibly repatriated. She sets out to discover more about him and appears reasonably content with the resulting sombre article about Norwegians’ troubled conscience – though the question of where Aslan is now is another matter.In fact, Asta (and Live) may both be more distracted by the issue of Asta’s depression and possible self-harm. Everything that we see on screen: all the slow establishing shots, the angular visual compositions, all the bright, palate-cleansing tableaux of the town and its steep picturesque lanes, the sweet shots of the cat, the newspaper investigating and the chairs … It may all just be displacement activity. It may all simply be about Asta’s healing – or about her reluctance to heal. And this healing also plays a part in the fact that Live appears to be in love with Asta.And the emptiness of the town is itself arresting. The pandemic isn’t mentioned and no-one is wearing masks. But I wonder if Emblem hasn’t adopted a kind of lockdown aesthetic for his movie, a deliberate dream-like emptiness. A Human Position is a question mark of a film with its elusive, happy-sad tone. It lingered in my mind. A Human Position screened at the Tromsø film festival in January 2021."
"Nothing Compares review – poignant, if limited, Sinéad O’Connor documentary",A new look at the life and career of the controversial singer shows us mostly what many of us already know but does so effectively,3,"It is impossible, at least for me, to watch a documentary on Sinéad O’Connor and not be impacted knowing that her 17-year-old son has just died by apparent suicide, and she herself, as I write this, is hospitalized after sending suicidal tweets. Naturally, this was not the case when this project was being produced, and, logically speaking, these outside factors should have no bearing on my critical appraisal of this film.But Sinéad O’Connor didn’t become an international sensation by following the roads of logic. A very in-your-face emotionalism has always been her stock in trade. One can trace her early years, at least as I encountered her in the United States, with three distinct acts. Her first hit music video was initially shocking, debuting O’Connor’s revelatory genderfluid look, but the song, I Want Your (Hands On Me), is far from fiery and abrasive, indeed nothing but catchy and sensual, as a lover’s call should be. Her eternal smash Nothing Compares 2 U remains one of pop music’s rawest, empathetic, most heartbreaking tracks. (Crying in the video didn’t hurt either.) Then there was the moment of righteous rage, ripping up a photo of Pope John Paul II on Saturday Night Live.Director Kathryn Ferguson has decided to cover, in vivid and exciting detail, O’Connor’s miserable upbringing, her overnight success, and her head-on collision with the sensationalist press and a fickle public. And that’s it. While the documentary does thread a recent interview in voiceover, and there is a closing credits tag of a modern performance, Nothing Compares is simply more about the Sinéad you already know.But a critic’s original sin is to review the movie you want to see, not the movie that exists. To that end, with expectations managed, Nothing Compares is a quite engaging document. In it, one will find remarkable footage of Sinéad, new to London in 1985, in rehearsals with her early band. She appears like a stick of dynamite in these washed-out videos, recorded in a small room with brick walls, her voice cartwheeling in pitch and volume, smiling to her bandmates, finding her footing, and unable to keep still. It’s incredible.Counterbalancing these moments of joy is the deep dive into her abusive childhood. The cruelty she felt at her mother’s hands, for which Sinéad mostly blames the cycle of violence perpetuated by an Irish society in the grips of the Catholic Church, is represented in artfully re-enacted glimpses, though discussed in vivid detail. A sequence describing the origin of the song Troy explains how young Sinéad was forced to live, day-and-night for an entire summer, in the garden behind her house, with her mother ignoring her cries from a lit window. To this day, she is triggered by the onset of dusk, as it reminds her of another oncoming night where she may not be let back in the house.One comes away from Nothing Compares fully understanding that this was an artist that really did have nothing to lose. When she acted indelicately in the United States, she wasn’t looking for trouble, this was just a person already so troubled that there was no point in her playing a publicity game.Some may have forgotten that before her Saturday Night Live moment in 1992, there was a huge scandal after refusing to let the state-funded Garden State Arts Center in New Jersey play a tape of the American national anthem before her show, as was customary. (That facility is now the PNC Bank Arts Center, this is no longer an issue.) It is appalling to see the frothing, reactionary news clips to O’Connor’s simple request that the song not be played. It’s a reminder that pig-headed, posturing tough guys weren’t an invention of the Trump administration. Old interviews with Ireland’s Gay Byrne of the Late, Late Show have much more tact, but are no less condescending.O’Connor’s call to “fight the real enemy” on SNL is shown in full, and another thing I did not know is that the photo she used was one that once belonged to her mother. Sinéad didn’t do anything that wasn’t rich with meaning.The incident was soon followed up with an appearance at Bobfest, a concert at Madison Square Garden for Bob Dylan’s 30th anniversary as a recording artist, in which she was scheduled to sing I Believe in You. She was met with a barrage of boos and applause, and since I Believe in You is a quiet song she knew she had to pivot. She belted out Bob Marley’s War (as she did on SNL) a cappella, then sobbed in Kris Kristofferson’s arms.Nothing Compares is essentially bookended by this moment, and presents it as both a triumph and tragic climax. She looked at the abyss and fought back. She didn’t let the bastards get her down (as Kristofferson said quietly on stage) but she did, ultimately, retreat from the public sphere. It remains unclear if this was her choice, or because the press and mainstream society was just done with her. This is something for the next Sinéad O’Connor documentary to investigate.Nothing Compares is showing at the Sundance film festival and will be released later this yearIn the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

Fatal Attraction review – stage thriller is an affair to forget,"Theatre Royal, BrightonThe 1987 revenge movie returns as a play, with Kym Marsh starring as a blandly monstrous ‘bunny boiler’ spurned by her married lover",1,"Lock up your rabbits! The 1987 thriller that inspired the phrase “bunny boiler” – to describe a psychotically clingy lover – is back. Fatal Attraction exploited the terror of sexual promiscuity in the shadow of Aids, as well as the Reagan-era idealisation of the nuclear family. Cinema audiences booed the vengeful woman spurned by her married lover. Has the emphasis shifted now that gaslighting, white-male privilege and #MeToo have entered the lexicon?The script by James Dearden, who also wrote the film, gives the errant husband Dan Gallagher (Oliver Farnworth) narrating privileges (“You think I’m crazy? You’d be right!”) but few glimmers of self-knowledge. More modulation from Farnworth would have been nice. Announcing bleakly that he once had it all, he sounds scarcely less peevish during flashbacks to happier days.Kym Marsh as Alex, who slashes her wrists then stalks Dan and his family, exhibits restraint in not vamping it up immediately. But the play still makes her blandly monstrous; an effect worthy of Attack of the 50 Foot Woman imagines her looming over Manhattan via video screen. Telling the story from Alex’s perspective could have repurposed the material to better suit the times. There isn’t much point incorporating mobile phones, feng shui and Covid fist bumps if the attitude still smacks of the 1980s.One radical difference is the ending, which sticks to Dearden’s downbeat original draft that never made it to the film’s final cut. Other scenes narrate what can’t be shown (“Sulphuric acid! The car’s completely ruined!”) or downgrade what can. No groping in the elevator, no sex in the sink. There isn’t enough heat on stage to toast a bunny, let alone boil one.John Macaulay as Dan’s pal Jimmy has one devilish scene. After Alex reveals she is pregnant, he offers his friend a cheerful take worthy of Seinfeld’s George Costanza: “It’s early days. She could lose the baby!” Everything is eclipsed, though, by the death of Bugs. On screen, we saw only the shocking aftermath. On stage, Alex hoists the pot on to the stove, cranks up the gas, then strolls away with a wicked smile. It’s such a leisurely enterprise that it seems churlish not to add seasoning.Fatal Attraction is at the Theatre Royal, Brighton, until 22 January then touring."
Breaking (aka 892) review – John Boyega holds together by-the-book hostage drama,A sensitive lead performance helps lift an empathetic yet often cliched retelling of a troubled veteran who holds up a bank,3,"John Boyega gives an honest, intuitive and sensitive performance in this fervent if slightly by-the-numbers hostage drama – and it is one of Michael K Williams’s final appearances on film, playing the negotiator. First-time feature director Abi Damaris Corbin has co-written the screenplay with the British dramatist Kwame Kwei-Armah, inspired by the real case of a depressed US Marine Corps veteran who in 2017 calmly walked into a bank in Atlanta, Georgia, and threatened to detonate the bomb he claimed was in his backpack unless he was paid the $892 he was owed in disability benefits – money that had been suddenly discontinued for opaque bureaucratic reasons, plunging him into poverty.Boyega plays Brian Easley, a guy who served honourably in the military but like so many in his position has found the transition to civilian life a trial; he has become estranged from his wife and infant daughter, alienated from his wider family, vulnerably housed and without stable employment, depressed and suffering from delusions. When he walks into the bank, his polite, almost diffident manner with the terrified bank clerks may be an indicator of his fundamental decency – or a symptom of his insanity. Selenis Leyva and Nicole Beharie play the bank employees, Olivia Washington is Brian’s anguished wife and Williams is the negotiator – a former military man himself who understands how callous America can be to the guys like him and Brian.Breaking is interesting on the implied, unspoken endgame of hostage situations like this – the way negotiators will appear to take the demands seriously to keep the criminal talking, while at some level everyone knows how it is going to play out. And Boyega conveys the fact that it is now not just about – or not at all about – the money which he knows he is not going to get. It is about being heard. Then there is the weird, Stockholm-syndrome solidarity developing between Brian and the bank staff, based partly on their growing appreciation of his troubled humanity and also their (understandable) suspicion that they will be collateral damage if armed police storm the bank.There is also the question of racism. Brian asks one bank clerk if they have ever been robbed before and what happened to the robber. “Arrested” she replies, from which Brian grimly concludes that this man must have been white – a terrible omen.This is a well-crafted film but there are, perhaps inevitably, hints of Zucker-Abrahams cliche in the caring TV news journalist (Connie Britton) who talks to Brian on the phone and the negotiator (Williams) whose integrity is at odds with his cynical bosses who might want to solve the situation with a sniper’s bullet instead of reaching out to Brian and talking him down. Basically, nothing much evolves or changes in the film’s various personae as it plays out, almost in real time: the brief flashbacks to Brian’s military service and to his later bureaucratic ordeals in the VA office are all telling us what we pretty well knew already. Boyega’s performance has an essential sympathy and dignity that are vital to this drama; an unshowy sense of self-worth that keeps it together.Breaking screened at the Sundance film festival and is released in the UK on 27 March on digital platforms."
Non Western review – heartfelt reflection on marriage and Native American identity,The past grapples uneasily with present as director Laura Plancarte examines the tests facing a couple as they plan their wedding in the rural west,3,"Thaddeus and Nanci, the subjects of Laura Plancarte’s intimate documentary, make for an idiosyncratic couple. While the bubbly Nanci has a natural, charismatic openness, Thaddeus is much more elusive and reserved. Still, their differences run deeper than a matter of contrasting personalities. Thaddeus, born into the Northern Cheyenne tribe, was removed from his Native American community at a young age. Meanwhile, Nanci, who is white, grew up on a Lakota reservation.Despite the differences in their backgrounds, what Nanci and Thaddeus do share – apart from their love for each other – is a difficult childhood, marred by domestic abuse and financial precariousness – the same stories of disenfranchisement that ripple through generations of Native Americans living in Montana. Conversations that Thaddeus and Nanci have with their friends and neighbours make free mention of suicide and addiction, spoken with a tragic matter-of-factness.These intergenerational traumas form a wedge between the pair as they prepare for their wedding. Thaddeus wants Nanci to adhere to the traditional roles of a Northern Cheyenne woman; this means leaving all the household domestic responsibilities to her. On the other hand, Nanci, who has a PhD and works at a university, feels sorely burdened by these expectations. Still, while Thaddeus’s attitude is outdated, the film as well as Nanci don’t make simple judgment calls – both acknowledge that such mindsets stem from an innate need to cling to one’s disappearing heritage.While several of Plancarte’s stylistic choices are at times odd, including an on-the-nose inclusion of Ben Rogers’s Cowboys and Indians tune, the film is a heartfelt ode to the resilience of love that can triumph over differences. Non Western is available on 21 January on True Story"
Radiograph of a Family review – unveiling a marriage shaped by Iran’s history,Firouzeh Khosrovani’s autobiographical film shows how the turbulent currents of Iranian life defined her family’s life,3,"Firouzeh Khosrovani’s autobiographical documentary opens in a grand yet sparely decorated drawing room, painted in white. As an unhurried tracking shot pulls viewers into the strangely still space, a sense of mystery permeates: nearly all the furniture is draped in ivory-coloured cloth. Indeed, the film operates like an act of unveiling. Peering through the hazy gauze of the past, Khosrovani explores her parents’ complex against the shifting tides of Iranian history.On her wedding day, Khosrovani’s mother, Tayi, married with only a photograph of her father, Hossein, present, while he was studying radiology in Switzerland. Having grown up in a religious household in Iran, Tayi was never at ease in Geneva, where she spent the early years of her marriage. When she became pregnant with Firouzeh, she urged a reluctant Hossein to return to Tehran, right on the brink of the Iranian revolution.Photos, home videos and archival newsreels comprise the bulk of the film’s visual materials, showing how personal and collective memories deeply intertwine. Khosrovani deploys her family archive in a startling way. Instead of a simple slideshow, the camera gazes directly at the photos for an extended period, the slight unsteadiness in each shot mirroring the turbulence that soon seeped into the marriage. With an 18-year age gap between them, the couple had markedly different attitudes to their home country. Moreover, the more secular Hossein treasured western classical music, while Tayi became increasingly devout and conservative as the Iranian regime changed.Still, these changes are observed without judgment, but with a child’s empathetic curiosity about their parents. While the audio re-enactment of Tayi and Hossein’s conversations are occasionally overly narrativised, this is a beautifully crafted work of family history with an especially powerful ending. Radiograph of a Family is in cinemas from 21 January."
Comets review – a lovers’ reunion charged with cosmic poignancy,A surprise reappearance throws the life of middle-aged widow into otherworldly flux in this strangely affecting drama,3,"Here is an intriguing cine-novella from Georgian film-maker Tamar Shavgulidze, which is at first unassumingly contemporary and realist, but which then takes a deadpan left turn into something really strange; it becomes like something from the 1960s counterculture, yet is as coolly paced and controlled as everything that has gone before.Initially, Comets seems like a straightforwardly bittersweet “reunion” tale, full of poignant regret. Nana (Ketevan Gegeshidze) is a middle-aged widow who is pottering about her garden one sunlit afternoon, squabbling mildly with her grownup daughter Irina (Ekaterine Kalatozishvili), when suddenly they have a visitor: a rather stylishly attired woman of Nana’s age, also called Irina (Nino Kasradze). This is the person with whom Nana had a semi-secret love affair when they were teenagers, which caused much local scandal. Irina ran away to begin a glamorous existence in Krakow and Berlin and Nana blandly (or perhaps penitentially) stayed in her home town and had children: Irina is of course named after her lost love and like the older Irina she exasperates Nana by wearing sunglasses to conceal her mood.There is much sadness in Nana’s life, particularly in her relationship with her late husband. The two women’s conversation now is interspersed with flashback scenes of them together in this very same garden, the two being played as teenagers by Mariam Iremashvili and Nina Mazodier. What is there between them now? Reproach? Sadness? Or a flash of something else — maybe that they could still revive their old feelings, because what on earth have they got to lose? Love is a comet that blazes into our lives all too rarely.But could it be that as young people Nana and Irina experienced something else: something even more unearthly and exalting and intergalactic? A visitation of something rich and strange, something that made sense of how alien they felt? An interesting experiment in the alternative reality that is love. Comets is available on 18 January on Mubi"
Save the Cinema review – feelgood slop based on a true story,Samantha Morton and Jonathan Pryce are squandered in this tale of a Welsh community’s plucky attempt to save their local cinema,2,"Based on a true story, Save the Cinema is the kind of plucky underdog feelgood slop that the British film industry churns out on a regular basis, largely to the indifference of audiences. It tells of a small Welsh community that bands together to save their listed art deco cinema (which also doubles as the home for the local youth theatre) from shifty developers who want to pull it down and build a mall.It’s an Ealing-alike gentle comedy populated by lovable eccentrics, and in Samantha Morton and Jonathan Pryce punches considerably above its weight in terms of casting. But the film-making decisions – from a score that sounds as though it was borrowed from an advertisement for life insurance, to the toffee and treacle colour palette, to a screenplay that is amiable, inoffensive but rarely funny – suggest that perhaps the cinema wasn’t worth saving after all.

Ailey review – illuminating film about the choreographer Alvin Ailey,"Jamila Wignot’s subtle documentary explores the influences, legacy – and ​private life – of the ​American dance pioneer",3,"“Alvin Ailey is black and universal,” says the actor Cicely Tyson as she presents him with a lifetime achievement award in a clip from 1988 that opens this thoughtful documentary about the African American dancer and choreographer. Film-maker Jamila Wignot pays particular attention to the specificity of Ailey’s black influences: the church, blues music and his southern upbringing, all of which informed his best-known work, Revelations (1960).Though Ailey was widely acclaimed, interviews with his former dancers, including Judith Jamison and George Faison, reveal the extent of his personal alienation. Being “the only one” in the predominantly white field of modern dance was only one aspect of his plight. Wignot subtly teases out the fact that despite having relationships with men, Ailey was not integrated into the queer community. He died from Aids-related complications, aged 58, in 1989.Ailey’s story is interspersed with rehearsal scenes of a new work celebrating the 50th anniversary of the company he founded. Yet behind-the-scenes images of the dancers preparing for Lazarus are never as interesting or as graceful as the archive footage of Ailey himself.In cinemas and on demand"
Minyan review – tender coming-of-age tale of a gay Jewish New Yorker,A teenager in Brooklyn’s Russian-Jewish community covertly explores his sexuality in Eric Steel’s evocative 80s-set drama,4,"In the Russian-Jewish community of Brighton Beach in Brooklyn in the 1980s, gay yeshiva student David (Samuel H Levine) is having an identity crisis. Closely monitored by his overbearing parents, he moves in with his newly widowed grandfather, Josef (Ron Rifkin), on the basis that he will complete the building’s “minyan” – the minimum number of people needed for communal worship. Josef’s apartment is only a few blocks away, but in such a tight-knit community it might as well be another country. From this new home, David begins to explore his sexuality, taking the train to a gay bar in the East Village, embarking on an affair with a gorgeous bartender, and reading James Baldwin’s Giovanni’s Room in the local library.The film’s bluesy woodwind score has a teasing, goading quality that feels tinged with melancholy; the spectre of Aids hovers around the film’s edges. What’s most interesting about Eric Steel’s tender coming-of-age drama is the queerness hiding in plain sight. When fixing the toilet of the two men who live next door, David clocks that there’s only one bed.In cinemas and on demand"
Boiling Point review – Stephen Graham is on fire in nerve-jangling night in hell’s kitchen,"Audaciously filmed in a single take, Philip Barantini’s low-budget drama serves up a brilliant performance from Graham as a chef on the edge",4,"Movies that have the appearance of being filmed in a single continuous take usually raise two questions. First, is this actually a “one-shot” production (and if not, can you see the joins)? Second, does the format actively benefit the drama or is it merely a gimmick? Alfred Hitchcock famously referred to his experimental 1948 stage-to-screen adaptation of Rope as a “stunt”, and admitted to François Truffaut: “I really don’t know how I came to indulge in it.” More than six decades later, Alejandro González Iñárritu’s wildly overrated 2015 best picture Oscar-winner Birdman felt similarly indulgent – technically dazzling but ultimately hollow.Perhaps the greatest compliment I can pay actor turned director Philip Barantini’s low-budget Brit pic Boiling Point (co-written with James Cummings) is to say that I frequently forgot I was watching a brilliantly orchestrated one-shot film. Not that the format isn’t effective – far from it. It’s utterly immersive, conjuring the raw experience of an inexorably accelerating panic attack. Yet, like the 2015 German thriller Victoria, which was similarly captured in an authentic single take, this is first and foremost a gripping and gritty drama in which the spiralling descent of the narrative is enhanced and enriched by uninterrupted digital photography.Stephen Graham, who was so brilliant in last year’s BBC mini-series Time, and who gets an executive producer credit here, is on fire as Andy Jones, the already rattled head chef whose world is teetering on the brink of chaos. We first meet him scurrying through the crepuscular streets of London – late for work and ensconced in some on-the-hoof phone pleading that succinctly establishes the collapse of his family life. In the restaurant kitchen where his arrival is overdue, stalwart team leader Carly (Bifa winner Vinette Robinson) and her exasperated colleague Freeman (Ray Panthaki) are holding the fort, something that’s clearly become an increasingly common situation of late – another deftly delivered detail.Andy is overwrought (the Friday-before-Christmas rush is upon them), and swearily takes his stress out on others, his anxiety levels stoked by a visit from a patronisingly pernickety environmental health officer. Meanwhile, out in the restaurant, a rogues gallery of customers must be served. They range from a gaggle of social media influencers who are indulged rather than ejected, to an irate, racist patriarch performatively throwing his weight around on table seven. As for the soon-to-be engaged couple on table 13, they’ve flagged up a nut allergy that needs to be prioritised by the already overworked staff.And then there is Alistair Skye, a celebrity chef to whom Andy is uncomfortably indebted, played with brilliantly passive-aggressive smarm by Jason Flemyng. On the surface, Alistair is all smiles, assuring Andy that “we’re here to support you”, and insisting that he needn’t worry about the feared food critic with whom he has arrived (“You don’t need my endorsement, there’s such a buzz in this place!”). Yet soon enough, Alistair is taking credit for Andy’s menu (“I recognise all these dishes”) and offering smug serving suggestions (“Could I just get a little ramekin dish with some za’atar?”) while making increasingly threatening noises that reveal a deeper, more desperate purpose.Bifa-winning director of photography Matthew Lewis (who also shot the 2019 short from which this feature was born) leads us with superbly unobtrusive skill through this wholly believable hectic world. It’s a world in which everyone has a story, from the nervous young saucier hiding his forearms beneath untucked sleeves, to the game-faced maître d’ weepily phoning her father from the toilets, and the cocky chancer indulging in covert backstreet liaisons by the bins. Subplots about overdue pay increases and overstretched ambitions swirl amid the cacophony of standoffs and service bells (plaudits to the sound team), each thread skilfully interwoven into a complex mosaic of individual voices, all rising to a single scream.The result is a spicy nerve-jangler served with a chargrilled side order of jet-black gallows humour – a divine comedy barrelling towards inevitable tragedy, played out in hell’s kitchen where someone is bound to get burned.In cinemas and on digital platforms"
The 355 review – Jessica Chastain and her spy gang just don’t add up,"The combined might of Chastain, Lupita Nyong’o, Diane Kruger and Penélope Cruz can’t enliven this lumbering action thriller",2,"Diane Kruger slapping Jessica Chastain across the face with a frozen fish should be funny. The scene, sadly not played for laughs, is one of many wasted opportunities in this lacklustre action thriller. Chastain’s Mace and Kruger’s Marie, along with Khadijah (Lupita Nyong’o) and Graciela (Penélope Cruz), are international spies who team up to retrieve a “deadly cybertool” that’s fallen into the wrong hands.Simon Kinberg’s film feels aggressively focus-grouped for the girl-boss crowd. “James Bond never had to deal with real life,” says mother-of-two Graciela with an eye roll. Winking dialogue about how women have been erased from history is similarly crowbarred in. Kruger smoulders as a German goth with daddy issues, and the only agent with any sort of swagger; Nyong’o, resplendent in a sweater vest, plays a tech specialist. Cruz is as luminous as ever, despite the fact that her role is mostly limited to crying and holding the phone. “We need another round… or like 10!” jokes Mace. Not even a post-mission pint in Morocco can liven up the gang’s tepid chemistry."
The Humans review – no-frills update of a Tony-winning play,"Stephen Karam directs his own stage production, and while the cast and setting excel, it lacks a touch of cinematic flair",3,"The architectural quirks and flaws of a given space are harnessed to explore the tensions within the family inhabiting it: Stephen Karam’s The Humans is the latest in a long line of films to employ a device that was most recently used to impressive effect in Sean Durkin’s The Nest. But while Durkin’s picture was strikingly cinematic in its approach, The Humans struggles to escape its theatrical origins – the film is adapted from Karam’s own Tony award-winning stage play.It’s not the most visually arresting work, but the sound design team excel – the prewar apartment in lower Manhattan creaks and groans its displeasure during a dysfunctional family Thanksgiving. The casting is also first-rate, with Richard Jenkins and a wounded, garrulous Jayne Houdyshell the standouts. They play the father and mother of Beanie Feldstein’s Brigid, whose grimly daylight-free new home is the location chosen for dinner, and a dessert course serving of family scandal.In cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema"
The Tragedy of Macbeth review – Denzel Washington delivers a noirish nightmare,Frances McDormand and her co-star hit top form in Joel Coen’s austere reimagining of Shakespeare’s Scottish bloodbath,5,"What’s the point of another Macbeth movie? It wasn’t that long ago we had Justin Kurzel’s big realist version, with Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard. Well, there’s always a point if the film is as compelling and visually brilliant as this. Director Joel Coen, working for once without brother Ethan, has delivered a stark monochrome nightmare, refrigerated to an icy coldness. With Shakespeare’s text cut right back, it’s a version that brings us back to the language by framing the drama in theatrical, stylised ways: an agoraphobic ordeal in which bodies and faces loom up with tin-tack sharpness out of the creamy-white fog.Coen’s visual contrivances have something of Kurosawa and Welles, with some German expressionist shadows, and this looks like a crime drama from the 30s or 40s – but entirely naturally rather than as an interpretative affectation. Bruno Delbonnel’s cinematography is pellucid and austere and Stefan Dechant’s magnificent production design imagines Macbeth’s castle as a giant, rectilinear modernist house, with chilly courtyards bounded by vast vertiginous walls and corridors that extend like some sort of open-plan death row.Disturbingly, there is no sense of what it looks like from the outside: we are always within its Escher-like weirdness, with battlements that can extend infinitely into the fog. This Macbeth is in many ways similar to the Coen brothers’ black-and-white crime thriller The Man Who Wasn’t There, which had Frances McDormand as the barber’s wife, brooding and suffering, a lot like Lady Macbeth.And McDormand is of course Lady Macbeth here, a role she was born to play, bringing a hard-won domestic authority and her own sort of military determination to the plan to kill King Duncan.Macbeth is Denzel Washington, who portrays the Thane as already exhausted by his great triumph in the King’s cause at the very beginning, a moment at which he might be expected to look forward to retirement. Washington’s signature rolling swagger looks careworn, but his Macbeth submits to both the duplicitous supernatural promises and his wife’s demands like a soldier taking his orders. And then, angry and paranoid, he escalates his fanatical rule with a series of pre-emptive murders while McDormand’s Lady Macbeth retreats into horror and despair.Brendan Gleeson has a cameo as the King, and Coen imagines a gruesome close-up murder scene for him. Corey Hawkins is a fierce Macduff, lacerated with self-hate for abandoning his wife and children to the tyrant. Bertie Carvel is Banquo; Harry Melling is young Malcolm. Kathryn Hunter is the witch apparition who presents herself disturbingly to Macbeth with two reflections in a pool of water and Stephen Root is the hungover porter making gags about erectile dysfunction, hinting at the reason behind male rage.Washington takes the big speeches at an even pace, sometimes rolling over shades of meaning. He sees the floating dagger and the ghost of Banquo but we don’t. McDormand is more specific and precise in her delivery. Interestingly, Coen lets the two do the cheeky “If we should fail? We fail!” line-reading, which isn’t strictly accurate but has an irresistibly modern sound. Unlike Kurzel, Coen does not directly address the mystery of the couple’s childlessness but lets the issue hang in the air with Lady Macbeth’s lines about breastfeeding. And Coen offers an ingenious new theory about the identity and significance of the third murderer.The movie hits its stride immediately with a taut, athletic urgency and it contains some superb images – particularly the eerie miracle of Birnam Wood coming to Dunsinane, with Malcolm’s soldiers holding tree-branches over their heads in a restricted forest path and turning themselves into a spectacular river of boughs. This is a black-and-white world of violence and pain that scorches the retina. The Tragedy of Macbeth is released on 26 December in cinemas, and on 14 January on Apple TV+."
Rock Dog 2: Rock Around the Park review – hectic sequel with an all-over-the-place plot,This follow-up to the 2016 flop makes a scattershot attempt at fusing celebrity satire with a riotous musical plot,3,"“Fans are fickle. You never know when taste might change. It’s a numbers game, and I’m going to play it,” says Bodi, the guitar-hero hound from the village of Snow Mountain. While Rock Dog 2 nominally denounces selling out, perhaps mindful of how the 2016 original – one of the most expensive Chinese-produced animations ever – bombed, it hectically plays the numbers game itself. Half modern entertainment-biz trawl, half nostalgic Asian rural fable, this messy sequel tries to cover both western and Chinese angles – and toss around enough scattershot energy to keep everyone happy.Bodi’s power-pop trio True Blue are the hottest new act on the block, their music radiating cyan energy waves out to their following. But they have popped up on the radar of Lang, a music-impresario sheep with a fluffy pompadour and British Invasion accent, who has multiple agendas: not just to separate Bodi from his bandmates by teaming him up with starlet Lil’ Foxy, but to shut down Rock’n’Roll Park where the city’s diehard guitar warriors keep the flame burning. Meanwhile in Snow Mountain’s Tibet-style fastness, Bodi’s family are fretting about his sudden fame – though, making a killing selling keychains to True Blue-mad locals, possibly succumbing to the mania themselves.Despite the throwback big-label svengali setup, Rock Dog 2 is a very digital-age chimera: all-over-the-place plot, liberal borrowings including a Zootopia-style anthropomorphised city, and fervid pop-culture references from Bill & Ted to the Rolling Stones. The production values seem to be downgraded from the first film: the animation is cheap and stiff, predominantly zooming in on static backdrops rather than featuring much true “camera” movement, and there’s no star voice cast this time. But younger viewers won’t care. While its generic celebrity-age satire doesn’t bother to root out the original story kernel Pixar would have demanded, it is worldly enough to intrigue pre-teens, and even drums up a certain demented energy for the finale. Rock Dog 2: Rock Around the Park is released on Sky Cinema and Now on 8 January."
The Jack in the Box: Awakening review – gothic toy clown horror springs few surprises,An unsavoury oedipal pact provides the only original note in a sequel that otherwise goes through the motions,2,"By this point there is surely no way back for the clowning profession: every minor horror movie knows it can serve up a demonic pierrot as a bogeyman. With this sequel to 2019’s The Jack in the Box, Lawrence Fowler’s would-be franchise doubles down on the eponymous creepy toy by having its hellspawn harlequin manifest once the crank is turned. It’s rather beholden to The Conjuring (and uses the same title font) and, while writer-director Fowler obviously knows his horror, he doesn’t really show enough imagination here to blaze a bloody trail of his own.The knick-knack of the title is delivered to the country mansion of Olga Marsdale (Nicola Wright), a rich collector of vintage toys who is bedridden with bone cancer. Aware of its cursed past, she activates its ability to grant wishes and rearranges the revolving letters on the top from “JACK” to “LIFE”, before winding the crank. The dial on the top of the box indicates that six lives are going to be needed to achieve her wish; the box’s seller duly becomes victim no 1, and Olga browbeats snivelling son-cum-factotum Edgar (Matt McClure) to round up five more sacrifices. Luckily, wide-eyed Amy (Mollie Hindle) has just bulked up the serving staff by signing on as housemaid.Despite the Hollywood precursors, there’s a distinct strain of English gothic here. Not just in the fusty bedrooms and cellars with blinking lights, which Fowler exploits atmospherically, but in the claustrophobic mother-son relationship. Edgar overcomes his squeamishness towards murder in his desperation to save his parent, with one offering having a particularly oedipal edge.Unfortunately, that is the sole truly sordid moment in a grim trudge of rote butchery, with Hindle and her fellow sacrificial lambs given little of interest to do or say. Fowler pens everyone in with some lame restrictions, including 10ft estate walls in a world where ladders apparently don’t exist, and the inevitable phone-signal blackout. The rictus-grinning demon has it too easy here; real clowns know that a slip-up or two en route enhances the enjoyment. The Jack in the Box: Awakening is released on digital platforms in the UK on 3 January and in the US on 18 January."
Lola and the Sea review – promising trans drama let down by cliches,A trans woman – brilliantly played by Mya Bollaers – and her estranged father are flung together by grief in this well-intentioned yet contrived story,3,"Mya Bollaers is a magnetic presence in this Belgian-French film that approaches the story of an adolescent trans girl and her estranged father with good intentions but a thuddingly unsubtle directorial approach. Bollaers brings a fascinating combination of willowy vulnerability and steely fury to the role of Lola, whose father, Philippe (a clunky Benoît Magimel), cuts her out of the funeral of her beloved mother. Flung together to scatter the ashes, Lola and her father gradually reach something resembling an understanding.The screenplay relies heavily on cliches and contrivances, but there’s one lovely moment that speaks volumes: Lola fleetingly embraces her father from behind, he raises his hand to touch hers, but she’s already gone. A connection is possible, but Philippe has a lot of catching up to do.In cinemas and on demand"
The Tender Bar review – George Clooney directs almost farcically uneventful 70s-set drama,Amiable is the best that can be said of this adaptation of JR Moehringer’s Long Island coming-of-age memoir,2,"There’s a yellow tinge to the photography in George Clooney’s latest directorial outing that makes every shot look like a vintage postcard from the 1970s. And it’s fair to say that this amiable but almost farcically uneventful adaptation of the 2005 memoir by JR Moehringer is also postcard-thin in its plotting and insight.Tye Sheridan plays JR as an aspiring young writer; Daniel Ranieri plays his younger self, a precocious tyke who finds a father figure in his affable Uncle Charlie (Ben Affleck). The young JR hangs around the blue-collar Long Island bar that Charlie runs, charming the grizzled patrons and bumming drinks in return for the answers to newspaper word puzzles. His mother has high hopes for him; she also has cancer, which just sort of goes away halfway through the film. But even with the leverage of serious disease, it’s hard to get particularly invested in JR’s journey from a loving but eccentric working-class background to success at Yale.In cinemas now, and on Amazon Prime from 7 January"
Swan Song review – Mahershala Ali excels in beguiling sci-fi tale,Ali plays a terminally ill man who creates a disease-free version of himself who will live on after his death in Benjamin Cleary’s fine feature debut,4,"The first feature from Benjamin Cleary (after the Oscar-winning short film Stutterer) is a stylish, near-future-set story of love and loss, in which loss can be avoided thanks to radical new technological advances. Mahershala Ali plays Cameron, a husband and father who decides to protect his loved ones from the truth about his terminal diagnosis by signing up for an experimental programme. An alternative Cameron is created; all of his memories are uploaded, and this new, disease-free version of himself is seamlessly introduced into his life.Ali is tremendous in a dual role that takes in everything from a beguiling meet-cute with his future wife (Naomie Harris) to a third act consumed by grief and doubt about whether he did the best thing for his family after all."
Nine Days review – profound supernatural drama,Souls vie for a chance of life on Earth in this powerful debut feature from Japanese Brazilian director Edson Oda,4,"Severe behind his wire-rimmed spectacles but more emotionally engaged than he would care to admit, Will (Winston Duke) bears a great responsibility. Over the course of a nine-day selection process he interviews prospective “souls”, all vying for a single opportunity – to be born and to embark upon a life on Earth. This inventive, daringly spiritual feature debut from Japanese Brazilian writer-director Edson Oda combines a Shyamalan-esque high concept with a dusty lo-fi aesthetic that calls to mind Being John Malkovich.Will watches the lives of his selections unfold on VHS cassettes and a bank of portable televisions; the colour palette is heavy on 1950s municipal filing cabinet green. Pitted against Will – an individual slightly broken by his own experience of life – is Emma (a thrilling Zazie Beetz), an instinctively curious and empathic soul. With its score of spiralling, ascendant strings and a final scene that quotes Walt Whitman’s Song of Myself, Nine Days is, in its subdued way, a profound and powerful commentary on life."
Don’t Look Up review – an A-list apocalyptic mess,"Adam McKay’s star-studded climate change satire with Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lawrence et al lands its gags with all the aplomb of a giant comet",2,"A comet is on a collision course with Earth. The targets in this shrill, desperately unfunny climate change satire directed by Adam McKay are more scattershot. According to stoner PhD student Kate Dibiasky (Jennifer Lawrence) and her professor, Dr Randall Mindy (a self-consciously tic-y Leonardo DiCaprio), the asteroid is the size of Mount Everest and due to hit in six months.The pair try to warn Meryl Streep’s President Orlean about the impending “extinction-level event”, only to find her preoccupied by the midterm elections. They attempt to raise awareness on breakfast TV, but anchors Jack and Brie (Tyler Perry and Cate Blanchett) can’t help but give their bad news a positive spin. The only person with enough money to intervene is tech entrepreneur Peter Isherwell (Mark Rylance), who wants to mine the comet for its “$140tn worth of assets”. Party politics, celebrity gossip and social media memes are swiped at too. It feels cynical, then, when Timothée Chalamet shows up with no real narrative purpose other than to snog Lawrence.As Garry Marshall’s cursed holiday trilogy Valentine’s Day, New Year’s Eve and Mother’s Day has already proved, an ensemble cast stacked with A-listers is no guarantee of a good time. Neither is McKay’s bombastic, shake-you-by-the-shoulders direction. The smug asides plastered on screen, and the hyperactive inserts of nature documentary footage do nothing to raise the film’s real-life stakes.In cinemas now and on Netflix from 24 December"
West Side Story review – Spielberg’s remake takes off when it dances to its own tune,Rachel Zegler’s Maria alone justifies this handsome update of the classic Broadway musical hits – though not everyone is a perfect fit,3,"Do we really need a remake of West Side Story? Having won 10 Oscars (a record for a musical), including best picture, Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins’s 1961 screen incarnation of the 1957 Broadway musical hit remains a much-loved and much-watched “classic”; a self-consciously streetwise affair with weapons-grade earworm tunes and choreography that kids would try to mimic in school playgrounds for decades. Yet even the most ardent fan of the original would have to admit that time has not been kind to the sight of Natalie Wood playing a Latina. Hooray, then, for screen newcomer Rachel Zegler, who landed the lead role of Maria from an open casting call, and whose vibrantly natural performance almost singlehandedly justifies this “reimagining” from director Steven Spielberg.The story, which transposes the star-crossed lovers of Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet from Renaissance-era Verona to postwar New York, hardly needs rehearsing. Suffice to say that Spielberg’s version opens with what could be an outtake from the later stages of Saving Private Ryan – an aerial view of what looks like a bomb site, over which a wrecking ball ominously hangs. This is the stamping ground of the Jets, the white gang fighting a turf war with their sworn Puerto Rican enemies, the Sharks.Ansel Elgort is Tony, a one-time troublemaker now attempting to put his past behind him. When Tony falls for Maria at a dance designed to bring harmony between warring clans (a “social experiment”), he incurs the wrath of friends and foes alike. With a once-and-for-all rumble on the cards, into which gang leader Riff (the sinewy Mike Faist) seems determined to drag his old friend, the scene is set for cross-cultural tragedy of love and death.Shot in handsome widescreen vistas by Janusz Kaminski, Spielberg’s West Side Story starts with a strangely subdued palette that bursts into vibrant colour during skirt-swirling dancehall showdowns. Early scenes of the Jets staking out their turf call to mind the ragged street urchins from Lionel Bart’s Oliver!, another stage musical hit that became a 60s screen staple. Yet while Jon M Chu’s recent screen adaptation of In the Heights gave us wall-walking scenes that adventurously turned the world on its side, Spielberg and Kaminski lean into the simpler, low-angle, 45-degree tilts that have become common parlance in New York gang movies.As for the set-piece songs, Elgort struggles to breathe much life into Maria, his voice tinged with a touch of the Tony Hadleys whenever he gets into his upper register. It’s a shortcoming laid bare when he duets with Zegler, the agility of her voice putting his to shame. Odd, too, that Elgort, a hoofer who literally danced his way through the opening credits of Baby Driver, seems somewhat flat-footed when compared to his springy Jet counterparts. Could this duck-lipped, baby-faced Tony really have been just one punch away from murder?Where Spielberg and screenwriter Tony Kushner’s version comes into its own is in the moments where it dares to find its own distinct voice – nowhere more so than in placing Somewhere in the hands of Rita Moreno. Having played Anita in the 1961 film, a role thrillingly filled here by Ariana DeBose, Moreno, who also gets an exec-producer credit, comes to embody the heart and soul of this new production. As Valentina, widowed owner of Doc’s Drugstore, Moreno provides the genetic link between the past and the present, lending a sense of gravitas to scenes that might otherwise have teetered into parody. For me, her low-key rendition ofthe song is up there with the opening track of Tom Waits’s 1978 album Blue Valentine, rich in fragile, heartbreaking pathos.Other smart moves include casting the non-binary actor Iris Menas as Anybodys, a performance that has something of the oomph of Linda Manz’s brilliant turn in The Wanderers, repaying the inspirational debt that Philip Kaufman’s 1979 cult classic owed to the Wise/Robbins West Side Story, bringing everything full circle."
Being the Ricardos review – Kidman gets serious with Lucille Ball,"Nicole Kidman is brilliant, if anything but funny, in Aaron Sorkin’s writerly, behind-the-scenes take on I Love Lucy, with Javier Bardem as Desi Arnaz",3,"“I’m Lucille Ball – when I’m being funny, you’ll know it,” says Nicole Kidman, who plays the comic actor without so much as a wink. With her pencil-thin eyebrows, corkscrew curls and elastic mouth, Ball was known and loved for her starring role in the 1950s sitcom I Love Lucy. Kidman and writer-director Aaron Sorkin are less interested in recreating her gift for physical comedy than they are in fleshing out her serious side. Kidman has been funny before (she’s a hoot in To Die For and The Paperboy). Not so here. “I care about what works. I care about what’s funny,” she says, forehead wrinkling. Still, it’s a brilliant performance; witty, fierce and technical.Taking place over the course of a single episode of the show, from Monday’s table read to Friday’s live audience taping, the film mostly plays out on soundstages and Hollywood backlots. We also get a behind-the-scenes glimpse into the crumbling relationship between Ball and Desi Arnaz (Javier Bardem), her husband both on and off screen. Both are digitally enhanced in flashback scenes, a technique that is at once distracting and creepy.The film is obsessed with deconstructing good screenwriting, the way a line lands, and ensuring clear character motivation. Fans of Sorkin’s own dense, rhythmic screwball dialogue will enjoy watching Alia Shawkat and Jake Lacy trade zingers in the writers’ room.In cinemas now and on Amazon Prime Video from 21 December"
Slumber Party Massacre review – video nasty reboot puts some fun in sleepover carnage,"Disinterring the 1982 slasher horror, director Danishka Esterhazy tweaks the genre shocks in a playful movie",3,"The 1982 video-nasty classic The Slumber Party Massacre – a confection of polyester sleepwear, orangey fake blood and phallic construction equipment with remarkable battery longevity, directed by Amy Jones – gets a reboot for a new generation with this, along with a more euphonious title, shorn of the definitive article. This time the director is Danishka Esterhazy, whose previous feature, The Banana Splits Movie, similarly retweaked a near-forgotten property from the pop-culture landfill. After an 80s-set prologue that establishes driller killer Russ Thorn’s (Rob van Vuuren) stalk-and-skewer modus operandi, we catch up with lone survivor Trish Deveraux (Schelaine Bennett) in the present day. Trish is now a paranoid parent, worriedly sending off her only daughter Dana (Hannah Gonera, delightful) off for a rustic overnighter with her friends. Will history repeat itself?Not quite. Esterhazy and co have a few clever-ish tricks up their sleeves that invert viewer expectations. First and foremost is having a second slumber party in full swing across the lake, this one featuring a house full of beefcake boys, all lovingly filmed ripped abs and tousled hair, sinking beers and wantonly conducting pillow fights. The young women, on the other hand, are ready for trouble and therefore much slower to be picked off by the serial killer predator.It all playfully flirts with horror film conventions, offering up a winking orgy of patently fake gore and irony that’s for the most part pretty fun. At least the cast seem well in on the joke and are clearly having a blast, although the package could have been improved with a fewer sharper one-liners and tauter comic timing. At least the cinematography is period accurate, resembling low-budget Betamax from the last century filmed with smudged lenses. Slumber Party Massacre is released on 13 December on digital platforms."
There Is No Evil review – devastating everyday tales of life under Iran’s brutal regime,Mohammad Rasoulof’s Golden Bear winner examines the brutal impact of the death penalty and suppressed freedom on ordinary Iranians,4,"Four stories from contemporary Iran, all linked by the theme of capital punishment and suppression of freedoms, make up this Berlin Golden Bear-winning drama from Mohammad Rasoulof. It’s a typically forthright and powerful work from the director, who was sentenced to a year in prison in 2020 after three of his films were found to be “propaganda against the system”.Rather than take as its subject the prisoners sentenced to death, the film instead explores the impact on those who must enact the order; who, one way or another, are left with their own life sentences. A father and husband goes about the banal business of family life, but the comfortable existence that his job buys for his wife and daughter leaves him with chinks of trauma that leak through on the drive to work in the small hours of the morning. A soldier finds himself unable to follow the order to execute and makes a decision to escape instead. An older man lives with the consequences of making that same choice. Bleakly matter-of-fact in approach, the film has a devastating cumulative power that grows with each story."
Blue Bayou review – overcooked but wrenching US deportation drama ,Writer-director Justin Chon plays a Korean American Louisiana man faced with deportation just as his wife is about to give birth,2,"Inspired by the harrowing real-life stories of adopted children who find themselves facing deportation from the US to the countries of their birth, Blue Bayou is an eye-opening glimpse into a dysfunctional side of America. Justin Chon wrote, directs and stars in the picture, about a Korean American man raised in the Louisiana bayou who finds himself targeted by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement just as his wife (a miscast Alicia Vikander) is about to give birth to their first child.Chon’s directing choices are bold and sometimes interesting, but the screenplay – a big old overcooked melodrama that chucks in everything from a motorcycle chase to a terminal cancer subplot – is an almighty mess. Kudos, though, for a wrenching final scene involving Chon’s character, Antonio, and his stepdaughter, Jesse (Sydney Kowalske), that lays bare the human cost of an inhumane policy."
Boxing Day review – black British romcom plays it safe,Likable performances carry Aml Ameen’s festive meet-the-family feature that sticks a little too closely to the Richard Curtis formula,2,"A black British spin on the Richard Curtis formula, Boxing Day recycles plenty of the Christmas romcom themes – lots of extravagant public declarations of love; an entire plot that hangs on the fact that key characters fail to tell each other basic information – and sets them to a glossily antiseptic musical accompaniment courtesy of Little Mix star Leigh-Anne Pinnock.Aml Ameen directs and stars, playing a successful, Hollywood-based novelist returning home to visit his extended British Caribbean family in London for Christmas with his American fiancee, Lisa (a likable Aja Naomi King), in tow. A charismatic cast inject some sparkle, but the contrived plotting and thin characterisation take some of the shine off this festive bauble."
The Hand of God review – Paolo Sorrentino relives his teens in a film of two halves,"After a scattershot opening, Sorrentino’s drama about growing up in 1980s Naples blossoms into a drama of real depth",3,"The latest, most personal picture from Paolo Sorrentino, The Hand of God is a film of two uneven halves. Set in 1980s Naples and focused on Sorrentino’s alter ego, teenager Fabietto (Filippo Scotti), it is at first cacophonous and scattershot. With rumours circulating about Diego Maradona’s signing to SSC Napoli, there’s a fizzing excitement on the streets of the city. Fabietto’s extended family is boisterous, exaggerated, bursting out of the frame as regularly as his curvaceous Aunt Patrizia (Luisa Ranieri) spills out of her dress (spoiler: a lot). Toni Servillo and Teresa Saponangelo, as Fabietto’s parents, fill the story with love and laughter, mischief and marital drama.And then, quite suddenly, they are gone. Fabietto is orphaned; it’s only thanks to his devotion to Maradona and Napoli that he escapes the same fate. And the tone of the film shifts to a more subdued and introspective second half. It feels like the sullen pall of smoke after a firework display. But then something changes. The writing and characters take on a more satisfying depth. Sure, the gaudy pyrotechnics of the early part of the film are fun, but it’s not until later that we start to know Fabietto as a person rather than a passive observer.In cinemas now and on Netflix from 15 December"
The Danish Collector review – reflections of an excellent eye,The Exhibition on Screen series examines the modern French paintings collected by Danish businessman Wilhelm Hansen,3,"Here is a bit of a diversion from the Exhibition on Screen series’ usual practice of hanging their films around blockbuster artist names: this latest is a profile of Wilhelm Hansen, the “Danish collector” of the title, who assembled a mighty private collection of 19th-century French painting – centred on the impressionists – which was eventually donated to the Danish state in the early 1950s. The film actually takes its cue from the Royal Academy’s 2020 exhibition Gauguin and the Impressionists, whose curators are on hand to provide context.Hansen himself seems a solid if unspectacular figure: a wealthy insurance tycoon whose main biographical drama appears to be getting caught up in a banking collapse, of which he was cleared of criminal involvement but whose financial repercussions forced him to sell a large chunk of his collection. Much of this had been scooped up in Paris during the first world war, when prices for the kind of work he was interested in had slumped.Hansen did, however, have an excellent eye, acquiring works that spanned the full spectrum of early modern French painting, and its classical roots. His chief love, apparently, was the classic impressionism of Monet, Sisley and Degas, but he also worked backwards to the foundational works of Delacroix, Ingres and Corot and forwards to Cézanne and Gauguin. All these are normally housed in the Hansens’ former country home Ordrupgaard, now preserved and transformed into an art museum.Compared to an artist biography, there’s a little less ground to cover, so this film can afford a somewhat more languid pace than other Exhibition on Screen offerings; the most interesting material, perhaps, is the passages covering the development of art-dealing in concert with the rise of impressionism, and the history of collecting itself. A quiet, reflective film. The Danish Collector is released on 30 November in cinemas."
Red Snow review – vampire comedy spreads Christmas cheer not chills,This black comedy about an author of romantic vampire novels with an unexpected visitor is sucked dry of dramatic tension,2,"Home Alone meets The Lost Boys in this trashy half-way entertaining Christmas vampire movie from director Sean Nichols Lynch; it’s a black comedy with some silly splattery gore. Lynch makes the most of a limited budget and his self-aware script is sometimes genuinely funny, too. Still, you wouldn’t exactly call it light of touch and the actors struggle a bit with the comic register. Some scenes leave you wondering: is this intentionally naff or just a bit wooden?The setting is Lake Tahoe a couple of nights before Christmas. Dennice Cisneros plays Olivia, an unpublished author of romantic vampire novels who lives alone; her kitchen drawer is stuffed full of rejection letters. Any jobbing writer will sympathise with Olivia’s decision-making when she rescues a bat that turns out to be an actual vampire – a hot vampire at that. He is Luke (Nico Bellamy), and Olivia makes him an offer: he can crash for a few nights in her garage while he recovers from a nasty wooden-stake injury in return for reading her latest manuscript. So, while she warms up mugs of pigs’ blood for him in the microwave (“they were practically giving it away at the butcher’s”), he gives her line-by-line feedback on her prose.The fundamental flaw in the script is that Olivia overcomes her terror of Luke in about five minutes flat, switching to Twilight-ish fantasies of romance – even after a vampire hunter knocks at her door and Luke’s leather-jacket-wearing vamp buddies begin sniffing around. Barely a drop of dramatic tension remains. Red Snow is released on 6 December on digital platforms."
There Is No Evil review – passionate plea against Iran’s soul-poisoning executions,Dissident Mohammad Rasoulof blasts against his country’s profligate use of capital punishment that includes making citizens carry out death sentences,4,"Maybe you don’t go to Iranian cinema for nail-biting action and suspense. But that’s what you are given in this arresting portmanteau film, the Golden Bear winner at last year’s Berlin film festival. It is written and directed by film-maker and democracy campaigner Mohammad Rasoulof, who has repeatedly been victimised by the Iranian government for his dissident “propaganda” – most recently, in 2020, with a one-year prison sentence and two-year ban on film-making. As with Rasoulof’s fellow Iranian director Jafar Panahi, a ban of this sort can be finessed, by playing on the government’s strange pedantry and hypocrisy. If the film is technically registered to someone else and shown outside Iran at international film festivals where its appearance boosts Iran’s cultural prestige, the authorities appear to let it slide, though persist with harassment.There Is No Evil consists of four short stories – with twists and ingeniously concealed interconnections – on the topic of the death penalty and how it is poisoning the country’s soul. Hundreds of people are executed a year in Iran, including children. Execution of the condemned criminal is the job of civilian functionaries but also widely carried out by soldiers doing compulsory national service.In the first section, entitled There Is No Evil, the secret horror of the death penalty is the unacknowledged elephant in the room. Heshmat (Ehsan Mirhosseini), is a dull salaryman, who is shown living his ordinary life after the working day is done: picking his daughter up from school, dealing with his mother-in-law, taking the family out for pizza. It all seems blameless and bland until the working life resumes the next day. The second part, entitled She Said: “You Can Do It”, is where we get the thriller-style tension. Pouya (Kaveh Ahangar) is a young national service conscript horrified at the realisation that he must kill a condemned man. It is his job to accompany the prisoner from the cell to the gallows where he must kick the stool away. Does he have the nerve to turn his own weapon on his fellow soldiers?In the third, Birthday, Javad (Ahangar) is a national-service conscript taking advantage of the extra-long leave given to those who have done their execution duty, to travel to the country and propose to his girlfriend on her birthday, only to discover a hidden horror for which he is responsible. In the fourth section, Kiss Me, a musical cue discreetly hints at a relation with a story that has gone before: a middle-aged couple living in a remote, mountainous part of Iran play host to their sophisticated niece who has been living in Germany.There is great technique in the storytelling, and Rasoulof’s outrage and nausea at the state-sanctioned murder gives the film passion. There Is No Evil is in cinemas from 3 December."
All About Me! by Mel Brooks review – constant corpsing,The comedian and film-maker seems oblivious to his best material in an uneven life story in need of a punchline or two,0,"Mel Brooks is the last comic in the world you can imagine wanting to be Hamlet – although, of course, that role is just another way of getting all the attention. He did play a Shakespearean actor in a 1983 remake of Ernst Lubitsch’s comedy To Be Or Not to Be, but otherwise the Danish you’re most likely to associate with Brooks is the kind you buy in a deli. Now 95, the comedian, screenwriter and director of such beloved spoofs as Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein and Silent Movie has written his autobiography. As the title might suggest, All About Me! is very much the work of the man who, as a young Jewish comic in the Borscht Belt resorts, got his break as a “pool tummler” (Yiddish for “entertainer”), his job to keep the guests happy and alert, and stop them falling asleep round the swimming pool.Born Melvin Kaminsky, Brooks grew up in working-class Brooklyn, the youngest of four brothers, whose father died when he was two. There’s a priceless opening shtick about seeing Frankenstein as a boy, and worrying that the monster would get him; his mother reassured him that it would have to shlep all the way from Transylvania, find its way to get to South Third Street, then probably eat the Rothsteins downstairs first. The other childhood stuff is fairly mundane: memories of uncle Lee and religious fanatic Louie from Minsk, “clotheslines full of wet wash” and tributes to his mother, “a true heroine”.Once Brooks enters showbiz, the period he devotes most attention to (45 pages, 15 more than his best-loved film, The Producers) is his long spell writing for TV comic Sid Caesar, an experience that comes across as both the dream and the nightmare of his existence, as traumatic as his wartime service clearing landmines. It was a joyful, frenzied, hugely stressful period that brought on anxiety attacks – not surprisingly, given Caesar’s volatility: he once held Brooks out of a window by his belt.Despite the ensuing therapy, Brooks seems to have little self-awareness when it comes to his own behaviour: like the two occasions when he menaced a colleague into handing over everything in his pockets, the second time making him wade waist-deep in Central Park Lake. Brooks was simply one of life’s “wild beasts”, he says, but doesn’t look further into why certain clowns might have a touch of the sociopath, or just be a pain in the tuchus.He’s good at remembering where jokes came from – like the 48th St impresario drying his underwear, a model for the flamboyantly squalid Max Bialystock in The Producers – but heavy weather when recalling gags and routines: “Nobody knew what was happening but it was absolutely hilarious”… “I don’t know how I held it together”… This is a book that is constantly corpsing. He’s not so hot at theorising, either: he became a clown for the time-honoured reason that “you don’t hit the kid that makes you laugh”; New York humour has “a certain intensity and a certain pulse”; and, bottom line, “Inept idiots will always be fun”. If you were Bialystock, you’d say: “OK kid, what else ya got?”Not enough, alas, to make this an essential read. Among the minute recollections of each of his movies, there’s the odd morsel you may not have known (the deranged Nazi in The Producers was nearly played by Dustin Hoffman); but strangely, he leaves out the most outlandish story about Blazing Saddles, that screen siren Hedy Lamarr sued over her name being taken in vain, with its villain Hedley Lamarr. Nor is this the most revealing treasury of brushes with greatness: he recalls a joke shared with Bob Hope (“We both laughed. Life is funny”), advice and compliments from Alfred Hitchcock, walks with Caesar show colleague Woody Allen (“entertaining chatter”).As for personal life, Brooks refers in passing to the end of his first marriage, with no mention of his first wife, Florence Baum. There are tender recollections of his long marriage to actor Anne Bancroft, but also an uncomfortable moment, more telling than intended: when Bancroft was having trouble rehearsing a scene, he told her: “You know what’s even harder? Writing!” When Bancroft died, Brooks says, “For a long time, I was inconsolable”, but then collaborators “pulled me out of my abyss of despair and we went to work on our next musical together” – a bizarre evasion of an emotional landmine, and perhaps the book’s most poignant moment.Unless you’re a Brooks obsessive, or aching for a couple of transcripts of his very droll The 2000 Year Old Man ad libs with Carl Reiner, this is not the most gratifying read. Go back to his best movies instead: they’re sometimes uncomfortably dated, in places as creaky as Brooks’s knees must be. But you’d have to be Hedy Lamarr not to find them funny.

Shepherd review – isolation horror of sheep-herder on Scottish island,"Scything strings, ticking clocks and a lighthouse bell tolling make for an atmospheric if OTT drama ",3,"“Something’s haunting you, Mr Black. I can see it. Hope you get the chance to confront it.” With this utterance coming from Kate Dickie, playing a one-eyed ferry operator who keeps a stuffed crow on her boat, you know that confrontation is a given. She’s just shipped Eric Black (Tom Hughes) and his collie Baxter across a menacing stretch of water to the prehistoric-looking Scottish island where a husk of a cottage and a job as resident shepherd await him. “Escaping or running?” she asks, but he dodges the question. What is left unsaid is that he has just buried his pregnant wife Rachel (Gaia Weiss), something his face – a study in pasty desolation – suggests he may have had a hand in.Dickie’s goading suggests this might be framed as another self-consciously salty yarn along the lines of Robert Eggers’ 2019 film The Lighthouse, which, like Shepherd, was inspired by the Smalls lighthouse tragedy. But director Russell Owen’s less humorous brand of confinement horror takes a different tack. Eric corrals his sheep, starts glimpsing a jet-black revenant, and is transfixed by a sinister lighthouse prone to letting its fog-bell clank at dramatically emphatic moments; his isolation is reinforced largely through oppressive sound design. Said bell, dank reverb, creaking timbers, ticking clocks and a score heavy on the scything strings all combine into a psychological cacophony that feels like an Alfred Hitchcock migraine rattling around inside Hans Zimmer’s washing-machine drum.It’s a shame that the relentless sonic assault tends to drown out the emotional impact when snippets of Eric and Rachel’s past are periodically shaken free. Keeping deliberately permeable barriers between his protagonist’s waking and dream lives, moreover, lets Owen off the hook for the film’s lack of narrative precision. He does, though, excel at atmosphere, both with the imposing geographic scale and the musty cragside close-ups; Hughes, meanwhile, sparely conveys Eric’s muted agony. In the end though, while a bit self-defeating, this attempt at a maximalist style is ultimately admirable. Shepherd is released in cinemas on 26 November."
House of Gucci review – Lady Gaga murders in style in true-crime fashion house drama,"Ridley Scott’s pantomimey soap entertainingly tracks fractures in the fashion world as Patrizia Reggiano plots to kill her ex, Maurizio Gucci",4,"Ridley Scott’s fantastically rackety, messy soap opera about the fall of the house of Gucci is rescued from pure silliness by Lady Gaga’s glorious performance as Patrizia Reggiani, the enraged ex-wife of Maurizio Gucci, grandson of the fashion-house founder Guccio Gucci. She singlehandedly delivers the movie from any issues about Italianface casting: only she can get away with speaking English with the comedy foreign-a accent-a. Every time Gaga comes on screen, you just can’t help grinning at her sly elegance, mischief and performance-IQ, channelling Gina Lollobrigida or Claudia Cardinale in their early-50s gamine styles. There is a truly magnificent scene in which Patrizia is wearing nothing but weapons-grade lingerie in the marital bathroom – and yet somehow Maurizio, played by Adam Driver, is even more sexy in his demure monogrammed pyjamas.Until seeing this film I had no idea that in 1995, Reggiani, through a bizarre confidante and professional psychic called Pina Auriemma, played here by Salma Hayek, paid a hitman to kill Maurizio, so incensed was Reggiani by his infidelity and the resulting divorce. It is like hearing that Karen Millen thought about whacking her husband or finding out that the retailer Michael Marks planned to garrotte Thomas Spencer outside Marble Arch tube station. But there it is.Gaga shows us a Patrizia who is an aspirational young woman, a black-belt minx who is also profoundly innocent, with a secretarial day job working for her dad, a socially humble but well-off haulier. In 1970, she shows up at a Milan disco and meets-cute with gawky, lanky Maurizio Gucci, a law student with no great interest in the family business. He is played with gallant diffidence by Driver wearing a pair of big glasses – a mandarin-geek look I associate with Yves Saint Laurent.They fall in love, to the furious disdain of Maurizio’s father, Rodolfo, played by Jeremy Irons with one of those moustaches that you create by shaving downwards from the nose to create a kind of charcoal line along the upper lip. He is a pampered former movie-matinee idol who gave up showbiz to rejoin the family firm and now suspects Patrizia of being a gold-digger. But Patrizia and Maurizio get married, an event with which Ridley Scott and editor Claire Simpson create a showstopping transition: Driver and Gaga have full-on sex in her dad’s office which at the moment of Patrizia’s orgasm cuts to her beatific appearance in church in her bridal gown. A sexualised epiphany of loveliness.So Patrizia is to meet (and charm) the rest of the family, including Maurizio’s deadbeat loser cousin and wannabe designer Paolo: a bald, overweight guy played by … Jeffrey Tambor? No. It’s Jared Leto in some serious latex. And then there’s Maurizio’s genial uncle Aldo, played with a certain type of distrait charm by Al Pacino. This casting triggers a certain question: sure, dopey Paolo is Fredo, but who is Michael Corleone in this scenario? Maurizio or Patrizia? Yet just as Patrizia is coyly masterminding her man’s future dominance in the company, he is ungratefully fixing to sideline her after being re-enamoured of a certain upper-class acquaintance: Paola Franchi, played by Camille Cottin.House of Gucci – adapted by screenwriters Becky Johnston and Roberto Bentivegna from the non-fiction bestseller by Sara Gay Forden – is enjoyable despite, or because of, Scott’s touristy, pantomimey approach to Italy and Italian culture. Yet with real storytelling zest the director punches up every scene, often with some very old-school musical cues: trad opera almost every time. (Paolo Sorrentino would have played it differently but maybe nowhere near as entertainingly.) There’s some very broad dialogue: trying to concentrate on his design ideas but horrified at the thought of his dad going to prison for tax evasion and fraud, Paolo screeches: “How can I think about my LINE when Dad could be DROPPING THE SOAP?” When I saw this, the entire audience flinched as one, everyone thinking: “Please tell me we aren’t going to get a scene with Al Pacino in the jailhouse shower.” Thankfully, no. But Scott must have thought about it.In the end, this is Lady Gaga’s film: her watchability suffuses the picture, an arrabbiata sauce of wit, scorn and style. House of Gucci is released on 24 November in the US, 26 November in the UK, and 1 January in Australia."
Celts review – bitchy zingers sting at a birthday party in Belgrade ,"Director Milica Tomović’s debut is a sharp, well-scripted ensemble piece set in early 1990s Serbia",3,"This confident debut feature from Serbian writer-director Milica Tomović fits squarely into a rich but niche subgenre: comedy-dramas that unfold over the course of a party in a cramped apartment where multiple generations squabble and celebrate, revealing submerged secrets as the night wears on. Former communist countries are especially good at this sort of ensemble panorama, perhaps because of the way housing shortages and an assortment of other factors conspired to cramp multigenerational households together in small, brutalist buildings. Meanwhile, the deep bench of acting talent available surely helps when making fluid films like this composed of overlapping, semi-improvised dialogue that push the story forward by subtle degrees.Celts harks back to the early 1990s, just before Yugoslavia implodes into civil war. In a Belgrade suburb, frustrated and barely coping mother Marijana (Dubravka Kovjanic) organises a party to celebrate her daughter Minja (Katarina Dimic) turning eight. The festivity is themed around Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, a franchise then so popular that Minja’s entire class can sing the theme tune in English. Minja’s grandmother (Olga Odanović) struggles to find enough money to buy margarine to make a birthday cake (butter, unfortunately, costs 6 million dinar), while her father Otac (Stefan Trifunovic) borrows a three-legged mutt from the family next door for the day to make up for the fact that they can’t afford a new puppy. As the guests pile into the house, the kids run riot in the living room; the adults – an eclectic mix of fellow parents as well as aunts, uncles and friends – gather in the kitchen to argue about politics, art and the nation’s future.Tomović and her team take pains to drop period details into the clothes, decor and pop-culture allusions, but you have to wonder if it’s historically plausible that everyone, even in this somewhat arty milieu, would have been so casually accepting and unfazed by Marijana having not one but two gay siblings. Even so, the drama around one of them – stroppy lesbian English teacher Ceca (Jelena Đokić) flaming out when her ex-girlfriend (Nada Šargin) shows up with a new squeeze – is pretty entertaining and makes for some good bitchy zingers. Other story strands are less well developed and towards the end it feels like there are one too many narrative balls in the air; nevertheless the film’s ambition is impressive. Celts is released on 29 November on digital platforms."
Lapwing review – intriguing drama of 16th-century answer to the hostile environment,An intriguing debut feature set on the Lincolnshire coast depicts a Romani family hoodwinked and menaced by a vengeful salt farmer,3,"Screenwriter Laura Turner and director Philip Stevens are making their feature-film debuts with this intriguing, slightly stylised and quasi-theatrical piece: stark, oppressive, menacing, a historical drama with a slice of horror. It is set in 16th-century England on the remote Lincolnshire coast, a time when the Egyptian Act of 1554 effectively criminalised Romani and Gypsy people and those who harboured them.Stevens resourcefully uses the blank canvases of wild, empty coastline and forest to avoid the need for much specific period detail. David (played by Emmett J Scanlan from TV’s Peaky Blinders) is the aggressive bully who leads a small community of people farming salt from the marshes; he has made a deal with a Romani called Arif (Javed Khan) to get a boat to take him and his family away from England, taking half the payment up front and resentfully allowing Arif and the other Romani to camp nearby until the promised boat arrives. But David is getting ready to cheat the Romani and is all too ready to cheat his fellow farmers, too.Things are complicated further by David’s sister-in-law Patience (Hannah Douglas), a woman who is aphonic and whose gentle, inchoate, bird-like cries earn her the nickname “Lapwing”; she falls in love with one of the Romani, Rumi (Sebastian De Souza), which triggers a spasm of suspicious rage in David, in which his xenophobia and hatred of women fuse into a single paranoid meltdown. David and his relationship with his community are in fact slightly more central to the movie than you might expect from the premise and perhaps the film could have dramatised Rumi’s existence and inner life more than it does, but this is confident, distinctive work. Lapwing is released on 26 November in cinemas and on digital platforms."
Licorice Pizza review – Paul Thomas Anderson’s funniest and most relaxed film yet ,"Anderson’s latest is a romance about a teen boy wooing an older woman, starring two extraordinary newcomers and stuffed with fabulously hammy A-list cameos ",5,"As a title for this California pastoral from the sunlit west coast 1970s, Licorice Pizza is whimsically inspired. According to writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson, it’s actually the name of a now defunct SoCal record store chain. I was hoping he was making that up, like Anthony Burgess’s supposed cockney phrase “Queer as a clockwork orange”. But no. It really did exist, though the movie itself teeters between reality and nostalgist-hallucination.This is a love story set in 1973 (Erich Segal’s novel is in fact slyly positioned in one shot), and far too interesting and complicated to be called “coming-of-age”. A grinningly fast-talking 15-year-old boy meets a bored 25-year-old woman who works as assistant to a photographer taking pictures for the high-school yearbook. She is in equal parts amused, intrigued and depressed when this kid starts hitting on her, and she realises that she is somehow interested in him.Anderson makes glorious movie stars of his two newcomers. Cooper Hoffman, son of the late Philip Seymour Hoffman, is eerily assured as Gary Valentine, a heavy-set kid with iffy skin whose child-actor career in TV and movies is coming to an end, and is therefore turning his various side-hustles into the main event, running his own cockamamie company selling waterbeds. Alana Haim, of the pop band Haim (for whom Anderson has directed videos), is superb as the permanently exasperated Alana Kane, a young woman with Barbra Streisand’s beauty and charisma; appropriate, perhaps, as Streisand’s notoriously quick-tempered onetime boyfriend Jon Peters is played by Bradley Cooper in a walk-on role, as one of Gary’s dissatisfied waterbed customers.The love between Gary and Alana, if love it is, does not run smooth. Alana breaks Gary’s heart by holding hands with another child actor hardly older than he is; Gary infuriates Alana by putting the moves on a girl his own age. Alana retaliates by flirting with ageing movie star Jack Holden (Sean Penn), presumably based on William Holden (why not just make him William Holden?) and then uptight political candidate Joel Wachs (Benny Safdie). But we all know, even if we can scarcely believe it, where this is heading. And this hypnotically gorgeous, funny, romantic movie freewheels its way around from scene to scene, from character to character, from setpiece to setpiece, with absolute mastery. You float and ripple around it as if on a waterbed. But every casual line, kiss, automobile-ride, set-up and joke is a joy.Anderson says that Gary’s character is partly based on former child actor Gary Goetzman who grew up to be Tom Hanks’s producing partner, and partly on a kid he saw in 2001 trying to chat up an older woman in high school. Why did he reposition the story in 1973? Well, he is superb at evoking that era; perhaps an allusion to Harold and Maude is intended, though the nearest thing to cinematic quotation is a scene weirdly close to the political campaign office moments from Taxi Driver. Yet could it be that Anderson has chosen the 1970s for what many suggest was Jonathan Franzen’s motivation in choosing that era for his new novel Crossroads? Backdate your story to the disillusioned-yet-still-groovy 70s and it’s easier to explore issues of transgressive love and sex in the right mood of tolerant romantic adventure without getting bogged down in 21st-century gender politics?Maybe. The ironising 70s might also, incidentally, make it easier to get away with the perennial male fantasy of the teen boy entrancing an older woman (yeah right). The setting certainly allows characters to drive very, very fast to places where they drink very, very large amounts of alcohol: in fact, the driving scenes are rather like those in Quentin Tarantino’s LA-period film Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, and whereas Tarantino had crazy Charlie Manson, Anderson has freaky Jon Peters smashing up cars. There’s also a cinephile fetish-moment where Gary and Alana wind up in front of a movie theatre marquee advertising Live and Let Die (although Edgar Wright got there first with his vision of the Thunderball premiere in Last Night in Soho). We get jukebox slams of Paul McCartney’s Let Me Roll It and David Bowie’s Life on Mars, and in this film we do indeed see LAPD lawmen beating up the wrong guy: Gary.This is lighter and sunnier than previous Anderson pictures; subtract the porn and indeed the sex from Boogie Nights and you have something like it; remove the metaphysical anxiety from Inherent Vice and that comes reasonably close, too. It’s such a delectable film: I’ll be cutting myself another slice very soon. Licorice Pizza is out now in the US, and released on 1 January in the UK."
Araatika: Rise Up! review – Larissa Behrendt’s documentary dares to believe in a better Australia,A spirit of optimism pervades this compelling film about trying to create an Indigenous Australian haka,3,"It’s been a wonderful year for documentaries about Indigenous Australian artists, with Firestarter: Story of Bangarra charting the evolution of the magical Bangarra Dance Theatre and My Name is Gulpilil presenting a portrait, in the spirit of a living wake, of the great Yolŋu actor David Gulpilil.Now comes director Larissa Behrendt’s Araatika: Rise Up! – which isn’t about artists per se but certainly about creative expression, poised at the intersection of art and sport, following a group of NRL players as they create the First Nations equivalent of a haka.It’s not on the same level as the aforementioned productions (being a more modest and unprepossessing documentary, with fewer frills) but it’s nevertheless a warming and compelling watch, populated by likeable people pursuing a valuable endeavour. Splashes of visual bravado indicate a desire to create a more cinematically elevated work, which, while only partially realised, sprinkles the film with lovely images such as an opening drone shot of beautiful green terrain that lateralises the title, moving into the air and reaching towards the heavens.We’re soon taken to moments of action on the footy oval intercut with vision of an Indigenous dancer in the mid air, in front of a surreal brown background: a tableau divorced from space and time. This reminded me of Laurence Billiet’s Cathy Freeman documentary, Freeman, which also embraces athleticism as a form of expression and is laced with visions of Bangarra performer Lillian Banks playing “the spirit of Cathy”– attempting to channel via interpretative dance the emotional journey of the superstar sprinter.In Araatika we meet Dean Widders, former footballer and now Indigenous pathways manager for the NRL, who notes that he’s “seen from an early age what rugby league can do for an Aboriginal community”, with its emphasis on teamwork and sticking up for each other. Widders says watching the New Zealand team perform their haka, and observing the pride with which they do so, “always niggled at me”, given the Australia team had no such equivalent.He sets out on a mission to fill this void, consulting various parties for advice and at one point sitting down with Wesley Enoch, artistic director of Sydney festival, who compares watching sport and experiencing art as similar in the sense that both evoke in observers the feeling of “that’s part of me up there – you’re representing me and my culture”. He then delivers a proposition: “Get a mob together and come and dance,” and “Let’s make sure the rest of the world sees.” He gives Widders a platform at the Sydney festival for a performance, and by doing so, also gives the film-maker a tournament movie-esque trajectory, whereby the subjects work and train for a big third-act finale.This is an irresistible development (though it takes almost an hour of running time to get there), marking the kind of narrative inflection point that sometimes prompts a film-maker to modify their original vision to maximise a storytelling opportunity. Behrendt’s direction is a little distractible, partly due to the wealth of potential talking points, some of which are introduced and moved on from quickly.About half an hour in, for instance, we see visions of people in New Zealand performing the haka in the wake of the Christchurch massacre and are told it was “almost a way of uniting the nation” during a terrible time. This fascinating connection is befitting of more consideration, but it’s over in seconds. Documentarians invariably weigh up such challenges (ie to include or not to include, and if so, for how long) and sometimes settle on half solutions: resolving that the material is too good not to include, but not providing the space for it to be properly considered.Behrendt’s directorial style, broadly speaking, is that of a cine-essayist, talented at fishing through and arranging evidence, particularly when it comes to political and cultural context – an approach especially well-suited to her previous documentary, After the Apology. Just when you feel you have the tone and trajectory of Araatika: Rise Up! pegged, it has a habit of unexpectedly throwing something lovely or arresting at you – such as the sight of men in traditional Aboriginal makeup and garb walking down a Sydney street, flanking the harbour, en route to the final performance, of which the film’s weight and energy is behind.Dancers in this finale include Adam Goodes – recently the subject of The Final Quarter and The Australian Dream – and the journalist Stan Grant. The latter eloquently identifies the spirit of optimism implicit in Araatika and other recent docos about Indigenous Australians who have made highly significant contributions to public life, among them She Who Must Be Loved, Gurrumul, We Don’t Need a Map and parts of the Australia in Colour series. Grant sums it up when he reflects on how, during moments such as the time Australians took to the streets in droves in the 1960s to welcome back boxer Lionel Rose from Japan, “You can believe in something else: that there is another Australia, a better Australia.”Araatika: Rise Up! is streaming at the Sydney film festival On Demand until 21 November. It will air on NITV in 2022."
Fixed review – low-budget gangster Britflick lands few punches,Shifty bookie Daz is on the run from gangland bosses after fixing a bare-knuckle boxing match in Birmingham,2,"“They stabbed me and locked me in a broom cupboard. It’s not looking good mate.” If someone slipped Guy Ritchie a monkey or two to direct a low-budget gangster Britflick it might look a bit like this feature debut from Jez Alsop. It opens at a bare-knuckle boxing match in Birmingham, lairy geezers watching as two fighters pound each other’s faces into steak tartare. Just before the knockout punch, a shifty looking man slips out a side door. This is bookie Daz (Nicholas Clarke), who has fixed three fights by passing professional boxers off as amateurs. Now he’s been rumbled.For the rest of the film, we’re mostly confined in the broom cupboard with Daz, waiting for a gangland boss to show up. The camera keeps close to his face, cranking up the claustrophobia. Daz is a man in lockdown, but he’s not alone. He manages to get his smashed phone working and is constantly on the blower. First up is a call to his girlfriend at the airport. Tonight is the night they’re meant to be flying off to Spain to start a new life (that old crime-world chestnut). Mostly, the people he phones don’t want to know: “Piss off, Daz!”Clarke’s performance draws you in up to a point (some of the acting elsewhere is pretty ropey). He plays Daz as a bit of a loser, someone who’s got by on cheeky-chap banter. Now his luck has run out and he’s desperate. The script turns the screws with workmanlike efficiency until the arrival of a sob story intended to make you feel sorry for Daz and it all gets a bit exasperating. The film is never that believable either: set in gangster-movie-world where mockney geezers with necks the size of tree trunks in black leather jackets call each other “muppets”. Fixed is released on 22 November on digital platforms."
Encanto review – blandly frictionless Disney fairytale that misses the magic,"Walt Disney’s 60th animation boasts songs from Lin-Manuel Miranda and a fine voice cast, but it’s hampered by contradictory messages and a lack of sparkle",2,"This musical, boasting a lively voice cast and original songs by Lin-Manuel Miranda, has been promoted as the 60th “canonical” film from Walt Disney Animation Studios. But however well-meaning, this milestone movie could almost represent a creative crisis for Disney – it feels like yet another step down the cul-de-sac of bland, algorithmically generated entertainment: more Stepford content from the dream factory. There are some nice moments and sweet show tunes, but Encanto feels like it is aspiring to exactly that sort of bland frictionless perfection that the film itself is solemnly preaching against, with a contrived storyline that wants to have its metaphorical cake and eat it.Our heroine is Mirabel Madrigal: a smart, introspective, bespectacled teen living with her extended family in a magic house with a mind of its own in an idyllic village in a magically created valley somewhere in Colombia (“encanto” means enchantment or spell). She is voiced by Stephanie Beatriz, who recently had a small role in Miranda’s musical In the Heights but is probably still best known for playing the supercool tough cop Diaz in the TV comedy Brooklyn Nine-Nine.Mirabel’s grandma is the formidable matriarch Abuela (voiced by María Cecilia Botero), who lost her husband many years ago, and for whom this magical house was mysteriously created at the time, apparently rising up in defiance of this great sadness. And all of her children and grandchildren turn out each to have a magic power, of which Abuela is intensely proud. Mirabel’s mum Julieta (Angie Cepeda) can heal people with her cooking, and I guess only a pedant would ask why she doesn’t heal Mirabel’s eyesight. Mirabel’s sister Isabella (Diane Guerrero) is a perfect Instagram-style princess who can make flowers bloom with her sheer loveliness. Her other sister Luisa (Jessica Darrow) has super-strength and can lift buildings. Her aunt Pepa (Carolina Gaitán) can control the weather and cousin Dolores (Adassa) has super-hearing. This is a pretty heteronormative household but her cousin Camilo (Rhenzy Feliz) can shapeshift because he doesn’t know who he is yet.But wait. There is one person who doesn’t have a gift and that is poor Mirabel herself. Yet when a sudden, terrible crisis occurs and all the members of the Madrigal family look like losing their powers, it is Mirabel who must step up and save everyone and everything – by tracking down the family’s missing uncle Bruno (John Leguizamo) whose own gift of prophecy allowed him to foresee this awful eventuality and Mirabel’s own part in the fightback. And … well … maybe this family of fanatical overachievers need to see how their supernatural superiority is a neurotic group symptom of unhappiness. Maybe they need humble Mirabel to bring them to a new enlightenment.So are their gifts a good thing or a bad thing? They didn’t seem like such a bad thing in the film’s opening two acts: these gifts seemed to be part of everyone’s innocent well-being, abilities lightly and modestly worn. And as the rescuing of these powers is the plot motivation, it is an uncomfortable turnaround for these powers to be represented as something to be opposed or surmounted – a paradox which the film does not acknowledge or resolve – especially as we get a pretty broad hint that they may in any case be magically restored. This is a flavourless, unsatisfying film."
Becoming Cousteau review – getting in deep with the beanie-wearing ocean explorer,"An account of Jacques Cousteau’s life – co-produced by his children – that is not uncritical, but could have yielded more insights into the family",3,"For an “official” documentary – sanctioned by the Cousteau Society and co-produced by his children Diane and Pierre-Yves Cousteau – this account of Jacques Cousteau’s life and mermaid’s purse of achievements is not completely uncritical. Not only does it show how the ocean explorer, seen bludgeoning sharks and dynamiting coral reefs in his 1956 classic The Silent World, graduated to become an indefatigable conservationist before his death in 1997; it also broaches the emotional price paid by the Cousteau family for his constant horizon-chasing, something his little filmed first wife Simone seems to have been even more ruthless about: “No man in the world could offer me what this vessel has.”You’re probably familiar with the trademarks – the good ship Calypso’s crew of “dropouts”, the red beanies, the wanderlust – as rhapsodised by Cousteau in his films and TV specials, and lifted by Wes Anderson for 2004’s The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou. Even so, the course Cousteau charted through 20th-century exploration, exploitation and, belatedly, environmentalism is still quite stunning: pioneering western freediver, the inventor of the aqualung in Toulon, discoverer of the oil reserves that enriched Abu Dhabi, swashbuckling film-maker who won the Palme d’Or, and by the mid-1980s a de facto elder statesman whom governments could not afford to ignore on the emerging topic of climate change.Director Liz Garbus largely constructs her film from archive recordings of Cousteau and associates, and journal entries voiced by Vincent Cassel. Possibly, sustained sit-down interviews with his three surviving children (his heir apparent Philippe was tragically killed in a plane crash in 1979) might have yielded even more probing insights into the family dynamics – and the questing personality at its centre everyone had to accommodate.Becoming Cousteau is no hagiography, but greater distance might have also allowed Garbus to reflect more on the man’s environmental legacy. The film is keen to assert his involvement in the 1991 moratorium on Antarctic exploration. Kudos, for sure – but perhaps it’s possible that such media paragons, among them David Attenborough after him, have also allowed politicians to claim green credentials by association, rather than action. Becoming Cousteau is released in cinemas on 12 November."
The Colour Room review – Clarice Cliff story paints a bright and breezy picture,Phoebe Dynevor dazzles as the factory girl who became a celebrated ceramic artist in this rather too feelgood period drama,3,"Clarice Cliff was the working-class girl who left school at 13 destined for a life of menial work in the Staffordshire potteries; instead she rose to become a celebrated ceramicist. Her journey from the factory floor is told in this entertaining feelgood period drama, a bright and upbeat film that perhaps comes over as just a bit strenuously cheerful in places. The director is Claire McCarthy and there is a lovely performance by Phoebe Dynevor (Daphne the debutante in Bridgerton), who brings a breezy mischief and stubborn defiance to Clarice, who we meet in her early 20s working as a “paintress” – hand-painting patterns on to the pottery.Well, to hell with all that. Clarice sees no limits to her talent; she sets her sights on becoming a “modeller”, a more skilled role, traditionally men’s work. Her huge talent is spotted by factory owner Colley Shorter (go-to posho Matthew Goode); and you know from the moment these two clap eyes on each other that romance is on the cards. So Clarice gets her promotion, working under a sensitive art director (nicely played by David Morrissey). Some of her male colleagues make sarky digs – “what if she is one of them suffragettes,” one sneers when Clarice is handed keys to the factory – but there’s nothing too off-putting. Here and elsewhere I wondered if the film-makers have softened the edges too much, not wanting to risk making us feel bad or uncomfortable. Even the smoke chugs picturesquely out of factory chimneys.Clarice lives at home in a two-up two-down with her mum and sister. Every second of her spare time she paints: art deco-inspired patterns on china in sunshiny bright bursts of colour. Old duffers in the industry mansplain why women won’t buy her cheap and cheerful pottery (“you’ll find the modern woman has a more refined taste”). But Clarice knows exactly what women want (her Bizarre collection eventually sold more than 8.5m pieces). The film catches the excitement of this moment for Clarice, and Dynevor’s performance is wonderful. The Colour Room is released on 12 November in cinemas, on Sky Cinema and on NOW."
Keyboard Fantasies review – glorious doc about pioneering trans composer,This follows the rediscovery of Beverly Glenn-Copeland in his 70s – an electronic musician who radiates life and happiness,4,"Here’s a spirit-lifting documentary about black transgender electronic music pioneer Glenn Copeland. It begins with the story of how he was “discovered” a few years ago, aged 72. At home in Canada, Copeland reads the email he got in 2015 from a record shop owner in Japan: the guy offered to buy any spare copies of Keyboard Fantasies, an album Copeland self-released in 1986 on cassette. At the time he was known as Beverly Glenn-Copeland, and the album is a trippy mix of electronica, folk and new age, overlaid with Copeland’s sumptuous contralto tenor; it’s now seen as his masterpiece. He had pressed 200 tapes and sold around 50.I could watch Copeland talking for hours. With his smiling eyes he radiates life and happiness, basking in autumnal success – the world has finally caught up with him. He was born Beverly Glenn-Copeland into a middle-class family in Philadelphia. At 17 in the early 60s, he was one of the first black students at a prestigious Canadian university, studying classical music. Homosexuality was still illegal in Canada, but Copeland was open about his relationship with another woman. His parents carted him off to a psychiatric hospital for electroshock “therapy” but he escaped. After dropping out of college, Copeland recorded a couple of albums, both commercial disasters. Then in the early 80s he discovered computers – “and I was off to the races”.Copeland recorded Keyboard Fantasies using an Atari computer, a synth and a drum machine. It was decades ahead of its time, and the film mostly follows Copeland on tour playing to young audiences who have just discovered him. His band is an adorable ragtag of musicians in their 20s (they look younger, like the kind of A-level students who hang around the art room at lunch). Often music documentaries feel padded out with filler but honestly I could have spent another hour in Copeland’s company. Keyboard Fantasies is released on 12 November in cinemas."
Volcano review – spoon-glueing Ukrainian adventure takes a surreal turn,Roman Bondarchuk handles this strange tale about an interpreter left stranded with some locals with deadpan poise,4,"“That’s our wandering buoy. It slipped its anchor near the dam. It appears and disappears at will.” A light, unfathomable absurdity governs this 2018 fiction debut by Ukrainian documentarian Roman Bondarchuk, set in the area around the city of Kherson; a sun-roasted steppe north of the Crimea where Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) interpreter Lukas (Serhiy Stepansky) becomes stranded. He’s escorting an SUV full of foreign delegates when it breaks down and he wanders off in search of a mobile signal. On his return, both car and foreigners have vanished.Hitching a ride, Lukas is invited to stay with Vova (Viktor Zhdanov), a middle-aged potterer living with his mother and daughter in a capacious ramshackle construction on the banks of the Dnieper river. So begins Lukas’s initiation – like a milder Ukrainian version of Wake in Fright – into the local anomie. Vova enjoys sticking spoons to his forehead using the supply of glue that was his severance payment from the Soviet fish farm he worked for; then Lukas gets an invite to a listless student party where someone nicks his jacket and wallet. Constantly slipping sly details into the frame, Bondarchuk handles the whole farrago with a lovely deadpan poise. Incensed by the theft, Lukas heads to the police station to make a complaint. Cut to him in the cells.This heap of eccentricity makes Volcano an oblique cousin of the vitriolic satire of Sergei Loznitsa’s 2018 film Donbass. Taking place in a weird demilitarised zone between the present conflict and a deeper Soviet hinterland, Lukas’s adventure feels post-historical, post-democratic and – with everyone comically flailing for their bearings on this disorientating new frontier – almost post-ironic. Perhaps in its second half, Bondarchuk lets the drama get a little directionless, and the direction he does pick – Lukas’s fling with Vova’s daughter Murushka (Khrystyna Deylyk) – is a bit obvious. But combining roving vérité-style long takes with grand compositions such as the opening overhead cargo-ship shot, Bondarchuk is able to both immerse and surreally startle en route. Volcano is released in cinemas on 12 November."
Burning review – the searing black summer documentary that Australia deserves ,Eva Orner’s bushfire exposé boils your blood and rattles your bones as it addresses the climate crisis head on and rips into the dark heart of modern Australia,5,"A handful of productions have already been released examining Australia’s catastrophic black summer bushfire season of 2019-20, including an ABC TV special (Wild Australia: After the Fires), a feature-length documentary shown in cinemas (A Fire Inside) and a six-part scripted drama series (Fires). Each has merits, but shared among them is a “don’t mention the war” tendency to acknowledge the role of human-induced climate change indirectly, cursorily or not at all, as if embracing of that old, denialist mantra that “now is not the time to talk about climate change”.In front of this backdrop comes director and Oscar-winning producer Eva Orner’s new exposé Burning – one of those rare documentaries that boils your blood and rattles your bones, leaving viewers longing for and (hopefully) demanding political change. Premiering in Australia at the Sydney film festival before its arrival on Amazon Prime Video on 26 November, it is the documentary Australia and – I think it is fair to say – the entire world deserves, exploring a complex subject with courage and clarity, taking seriously three simple but ever-salient words often heard in the climate protest movement: “Tell the truth.”Although it is always an appropriate time to talk about the climate crisis, Burning arrives at a particularly timely moment, with Cop26 now under way. The Australian government is being justly berated for its rhetorical shift (not to be confused with real action) towards net zero emissions by 2050, following a similar shift in that direction by News Corp, a company whose actions – in the words of Ketan Joshi – “have caused irreversible harm to human life, on a scale no other media organisation on the planet could ever aspire to”.When it comes to the climate crisis, as in Agatha Christie’s Orient Express, there’s a lot of blame to go around; a lot of fingerprints on the knife; a lot of people (howdy, Mathias!) who would probably like their past behaviour expunged from history. The point of Burning is not to level scores, but, again, to simply tell the truth, working from the vantage point that, as one interviewee puts it: “The greatest tragedy of this terrible black summer bushfire season was that we saw it coming.”Part of the difficulty in making this kind of documentary, which juggles many topics worthy of entire productions themselves and enters a conversational space fraught with politics and vested interests, involves anticipating and addressing counter-arguments without giving them unnecessary oxygen or embracing bogus two-siderism.This is presumably why Orner frontloads Burning with analysis of how there have always been fires in Australia, with this section of the film featuring the reflections of Greg Mullins, a former commissioner of Fire and Rescue New South Wales, who acknowledges that “fires in Australia are a constant” and “every year there are bushfires”. Mullins reminisces on how they used to be fought in the old days, including his first big fire in 1971, when people were beating out flames with tree branches, wet sacks and rakes.This pre-empts an explanation of how anthropogenic climate change has led to increased frequency and severity of fires. Firefighters once assumed, explains Mullins, that a very damaging fire would occur in NSW about once a decade. But after 1994 it was clear, he says, that Australia was experiencing more and more of them, those old assumptions no longer applying. As the veteran journalist Marian Wilkinson puts it: “This is exactly what climate scientists have predicted for Australia – longer fire seasons, more intense fire seasons.” It is of course is a global issue, though Australia remains the film’s focus.Burning recounts Scott Morrison famously bringing a piece of coal into question time in 2017, using parliament for what was, says Wilkinson again, “essentially a marketing presentation”. This event is significant in that it was one of the clearest (albeit far from the only) demonstrations of the extent to which our political leaders have become spokespeople for the fossil fuel industry, beholden to them. Underpinning the entire film in fact is an acknowledgement that the story of modern Australia is in many senses inseparable from the story of mining companies and the extraction of resources.Another important area of discussion, touched on briefly but with impact, is the role the media – particularly conservative outlets – have played in fuelling climate misinformation and denialism. There are also more inspirational elements, such as the story of young climate striker Daisy Jeffrey, which Orner threads throughout, resisting the cliched “but wait, there’s hope!” message often crowbarred into a documentary’s final moments.The director deftly balances many threads, and views the climate crisis through several lenses, including from environmental, political, social and moral perspectives. The pace is quick but not in a way that shortchanges important talking points. There are moments of tenderness – for instance a contemplation of trees being “arcs of time” – and there are also moments that make you want to shake your fists and scream “How could you?” at our politicians, Morrison especially.This is a tremendously well-made film with a burning vitality: without question one of the most important Australian documentaries of the 21st century so far. One of its many messages is the point that now is the time to talk about the climate crisis. As it will be tomorrow, and the next day, and the day after that.Burning is screening at the 2021 Sydney film festival and will be streaming on Amazon Prime Video from 26 November"
Spencer review – Kristen Stewart’s Diana impersonation is enjoyably strange,"Pablo Larraín’s overwrought fantasy, set during a stifling royal Christmas in 1991, offers an arthouse-bizarro version of Diana’s story",3,"What would have been Princess Diana’s 60th birthday came and went this summer, marked by a solemn new statue in the Sunken Garden at Kensington Palace in London, showing her with three generically grateful children; this statue effectively superseded the one of Diana with Dodi Fayed in Harrods department store, which was taken down in 2018. But maybe that new bronze image will itself be superseded by the arthouse-bizarro Diana promoted in Spencer, an entertaining, if overwrought, overpraised and slightly obtuse movie, an ironised fantasy opera without music. It is about Diana having a “crack-up” over one stifling Windsor Christmas at Sandringham in 1991, with which screenwriter Steven Knight appears to have transcribed a dream he once had after eating his bodyweight in brie. The director is the Chilean film-maker Pablo Larraín, and it features an intrusive score by Jonny Greenwood, deafeningly cranking up the dysfunction.Diana is cleverly impersonated by Kristen Stewart, who is particularly good at shoulder-shrugging convulsions of misery and protest – although this big-screen awards-season performance is not as good as Emma Corrin’s relaxed and sympathetic portrayal in TV’s The Crown. However, Stewart does get the biggest laugh of the year when Diana irritably dismisses a maid to be alone: “I want to masturbate …”As in Larraín’s 2016 film, Jackie, about Jackie Kennedy’s trauma after the JFK assassination, this features quite a bit of Diana wandering stricken through corridors, although Jackie had just been showered in her dead husband’s blood. To approximate something like that motivation, this film conspicuously exaggerates Diana’s first-world problems with black-comic stylings, fictional flourishes and some beautiful images. The nightmarish absurdity of what Diana had to endure and her consequent unhappiness create something that looks as if it has been co-directed by former Sun editor Kelvin MacKenzie and Dario Argento. The film maybe concedes a little drama-queen-of-hearts entitlement on Diana’s part, but of course we are supposed to be absolutely on her side, with flinch-making scenes of self-harm and bulimia.Diana has showed up to Sandringham alone, casually driving herself in her open-topped sports car, committing an unpardonable error of taste in arriving after the Queen (Stella Gonet). She is already semi-estranged from Charles (Jack Farthing), who snaps meanly at her over one of the interminable meals, and Diana is, moreover, menaced by a fictional glowering flunkey, Major Gregory (Timothy Spall). But there are friendly faces about: her boys William (Jack Nielen) and Harry (Freddie Spry), with whom Stewart has a sweet scene, playing at soldiers on parade. The fictional cook Darren (Sean Harris) is her confidant and mate, and she has her devoted fictional dresser Maggie (Sally Hawkins).What is most intolerable for Diana is having to wear the clothes picked out for her, and again Knight gives Stewart some great lines. Holding up a gown, she says to her sour-faced maid: “It doesn’t fit.” – “Have you tried it on?” – “With my mood.” Driven mad by depression and by the Firm’s callous indifference and emotional stagnancy, Diana roams the grounds at night, to the horror of the local police, and tries breaking in to her nearby childhood home.But the film ultimately implies that her problems are down to the ghastly Windsors: away from them, driving around in her car with the boys, listening to Mike and the Mechanics on the tape-deck and having an unpretentious KFC, she could relax and be herself, a Spencer. But you could argue that the Spencers were terribly grand and messed-up as well. Another type of film, without all the Halloween gothic naivety, might have challenged this view; it might have dramatised her relationship with her mother, say, or with the boys’ nanny, “Tiggy” Legge-Bourke. This an enjoyably strange spectacle, perhaps best appreciated by taking it less seriously than its creators intended. Spencer is in cinemas from 5 November."
Eternals review – Chloé Zhao’s indie nuance can’t power the Marvel machine,"The new diversity is welcome, but the Nomadland director’s socio-realist touches left me missing the brash humour and energy",2,"To paraphrase Mrs Merton: what first attracted director Chloé Zhao to the idea of directing something in the colossally lucrative Marvel franchise? Or, to paraphrase Nigel Planer’s fictional actor Nicholas Craig: were they offering Zhao a staggering amount of scope to develop the project?At all events, it was an interesting idea to hire the brilliant Oscar-winning film-maker Zhao, known for social-realist docudramas such as Nomadland and The Rider. But the very few authorial touches that she manages to bring to Eternals – some Terrence Malick-ish “golden hour” sunset scenes – only go to show how dominant the formula actually is. Perhaps there is the question of tone; I had the uncomfortable feeling that the all-important brash humour, DayGlo energy and operatic craziness of superheroism were being downplayed in favour of something more serious – the addictive inspiration of fast food being replaced by vegan cordon bleu. There are some nice touches and an attractive new diversity worn lightly, but this is an underpowered and uncertain film.The Eternals of the title are an order of divinities with various silly powers and familiar-sounding god-names who have lived incognito among humans for millennia; they include Thena (Angelina Jolie), Sersi (Gemma Chan), Ikaris (Richard Madden), Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), Sprite (Lia McHugh), Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), Druig (Barry Keoghan), Gilgamesh (Don Lee) and Ajak (Salma Hayek). They are commanded to protect Earthlings from periodic incursions by alien beings called “Deviants” but must otherwise refrain from getting involved in any of humanity’s wars, although Phastos bitterly regrets introducing us to his super-engineering skills, which apparently led to the atomic bomb. There’s a misjudged scene, treated as a mere passing episode, in which an anguish-filled Phastos stands solemnly in the wreckage of Hiroshima. (Could someone at least have pointed out that it affected Nagasaki as well?)A new Deviant attack in London brings the Eternals together for a fightback, but then it becomes horribly clear that the Eternals have been misled and now they must choose between their loyalty to celestial orders laid down from on high, and planet Earth’s humankind, which they have grown to love. This leads to some very protracted set-piece spectaculars, and admittedly amusing scenes for Nanjiani’s character Kingo, who in civilian mode is a Bollywood superstar but is prickly and defensive when it comes to his stalled career as a director (“I have directed some internet content …” he snaps, when pressed for details). But his status as the comic turn only underscores the heavy and unsatisfying seriousness of everything else. Eternals is released on 5 November in cinemas."
Red Notice review – Netflix’s biggest film to date offers little reward,"Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot and a spectacularly annoying Ryan Reynolds quip, steal and double-cross in a disposable, and ludicrously expensive, action comedy",1,"One of the supposed beauties of Netflix, and all other streamers with access to such vast resources, is that without the panicked need for box office success, there’s a certain freedom that’s then afforded. The risks that might be deemed too precarious in the global marketplace (Too original? Too adult? Too gay?) are no longer of such prioritised concern and thus big budgets can be allocated to biggish bets. It’s why Netflix was confident to take on Martin Scorsese’s $160m crime saga The Irishman after Paramount deemed it too expensive and why the streamer also spent $70m to kick off the Old Guard franchise with a diverse cast and a central, uncensored queer romance. Both paid off (the films rank among the streamer’s most-watched) and showed that a brave new world away from the safe repetition of homogeneous superheroes, remakes and superhero remakes might be possible.So with the arrival of Red Notice, a film that allegedly cost upwards of $200m, making it Netflix’s biggest budget to date, one might hope for something slightly out of the ordinary, a much-needed tweak on what a traditional studio might otherwise lazily offer. But what makes the film so maddening, along with many, many other reasons, is that it’s the most boringly indistinctive patchwork job we’ve seen for a long while, a beige piece of committee-approved product that slums from point A to point B to who cares. Like an increasing number of the streamer’s mass-market offerings, the overriding message appears to be: see, we can make films just as badly as everyone else! So much for the great disruptor …The script was at one point the centre of a heated auction with all the majors jostling for rights before Universal snapped them up but down the line, there was trepidation over the expense and Netflix stepped in to give the green light instead. It’s easy to see why as there’s inherently safe global appeal – Dwayne Johnson, Ryan Reynolds and Gal Gadot starring in an action comedy about global heists – elements that would make this worth the investment in or outside of the lower stakes world of streaming. But while the stage is set for a sleek James Bond meets Indiana Jones meets Ocean’s Eleven meets Dirty Rotten Scoundrels caper, writer-director Rawson Marshall Thurber stumbles on his way there, misfiring on every conceivable level, a film trying so hard to recall the fun of other films that it forgets to have any fun for itself.A red notice is a type of high-level international warrant afforded to an on-the-run-criminal, causing FBI agent John Hartley (Johnson) to track slippery art thief Nolan Booth (Reynolds) all the way to Rome. They’re forced into an uneasy partnership due to some guff about three golden eggs that Cleopatra used to own and that Booth is trying to steal. He almost manages to nab the first but Hartley intervenes and sends him to a remote Russian jail, a jail where he himself then ends up after he’s framed for stealing the egg by The Bishop (Gadot), another art thief eager to own them for herself. Hartley and Booth then decide to team up and take her down.The megabucks assembly of A-listers (each received a reported $20m for the film) might make sense in a boardroom – combined they have a reach of almost 400 million Instagram followers and their films have made over $20bn at the global box office – but there’s a vast, vibe-killing gap between what makes sense on paper and what works on screen. For a frippery such as this to fly, sky-high star power is as integral as bombastic set pieces but there’s a total lack of connective chemistry between the trio, each ill-suited to their role and the territory. It’s the worst, most removed algorithmic casting possible (even in Thurber’s ho-hum action comedy Central Intelligence, there was a spark between Johnson and co-star Kevin Hart) and watching the three on-screen makes for an overwhelmingly flat experience. Anything sexy is made asexual, anything charming is made charmless and so what should be a smooth ride is turned into a bumpy slog.The rat-a-tat back-and-forth between sworn enemies turned begrudging buddies Johnson and Reynolds is strikingly, embarrassingly unfunny and rapidly grating, thanks mostly to a spectacularly annoying turn from the latter, reheating his Deadpool and Free Guy shtick but with even less effective writing to play with. The dated pop culture references (Jurassic Park? Pulp Fiction? A Borat impression?) are as tiresome as the many schoolyard gay jokes and while one can understand the monetary appeal for them both, it feels like a career regression, remixing former glories rather than doing anything fresh. Gadot is not much help either, in a much smaller role, failing to bring any of the vampy fun required, sleepwalking through the motions, adept only when fighting. The nonsensically convoluted plot would perhaps be more forgivable if the stars were charismatic enough or the action were exciting enough but in a desperate search for something to squeeze enjoyment out of, it’s left to the locations to pick up the slack, the one good use of the film’s monstrous budget, whisking us around the world for some nice scenery while everything around it crumbles.There’s something so soulless and ineffectual about the aggressively unnecessary Red Notice that it almost plays like a pastiche of a Hollywood blockbuster, like a bot consumed the last 20 years of studio fare and spat out a facsimile as an experiment. No one expects films like this to change the game but, at the very least, they should be able to play it.Red Notice is out in selected cinemas from 5 November and on Netflix on 12 November"
Love Yourself Today review – folk-rocker Damien Dempsey does mass therapy,Beautifully shot documentary successfully explains the Dublin singer-songwriter’s appeal by focusing on what his songs mean to fans ,3,"Even if you’re not into his lumpen folk-rock polemics, this documentary and concert film goes a long way to explaining Dublin singer-songwriter Damien Dempsey’s unshakeable home-crowd following, and why – as we see at the beginning of Ross Killeen’s reflective film – he is able to pack out a series of gigs every Christmas. Dempsey’s story makes a fine case for music as personal balm, but juxtaposing it with three of his fans’ personal histories deepens the scope of his art into a true act of public communion and shared healing. At least, if the deluge of tears streaming down concertgoers’ cheeks here is anything to go by.The three Dubliners we hear from are elegant recovering heroin addict Nadia, who “gave up on life” after her brother’s murder; boxing coach Packy, gripped by social phobia since his teens and witness to the alleyway shooting of a friend; and longbearded Jonathan, a reformed alcoholic once traumatically attacked by a schoolteacher, who has discovered new meaning in life. The Dublin street-life nuggets – shot in beautifully desolate black and white by cinematographer Narayan van Maele – could be straight out of Dempsey’s lyrics. Unsurprisingly, there are close correspondences in the musician’s past: the shy working-class boy who started to sail close to the wind after his parents’ divorce and had his road to Damascus moment after being beaten senseless by 15 people. “It was a good little left-right,” he says. “It put me on a better path.”As well as its refreshing emphasis on mental health, and the importance of self- and mutual care, Love Yourself Today also makes clear how rooted in Irish tradition and folk ideals Dempsey is; the sweaty, chest-beating mass therapy of his Christmas concerts is an outsized version of the living-room family “singsongs” of his youth. “Don’t ever think the music comes from you. It comes through you,” is just one of the many platitudes Dempsey, who looks like a soulful bouncer, serves up. With his mum in the audience, who’s going to argue with that? Love Yourself Today screens on 30 October at the Doc’n Roll festival in London, then tours."
Paranormal Activity: Next of Kin review – hit series returns with ho-hum horror,"The overly derivative new chapter to the low-budget, high-profit horror franchise struggles to justify its existence",2,"There’s an odd comfort to the release of a new Paranormal Activity film just in time for Halloween, a prime spot it owned for five years after the Saw franchise released its grip and (temporarily) bled out. The repetitive yet often ingenious formula made for a communal effective experience that was also commercially lucrative – the micro-budget films, along with two spin-offs, have made almost $900m worldwide – but diminishing returns and an ever-changing horror landscape led producer Jason Blum to claim that the series was done with 2015’s underperforming 3D chapter, Ghost Dimension, inactivity taking over..Yet in the horror genre, nothing remains dead for long and with the resurrection of Halloween, Scream, Saw, The Exorcist and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the return of the lo-fi supernatural franchise was as inevitable as its debut on its new home – Paramount’s streaming platform. It’s a bold, if low-stakes move (the films usually cost under $5m to make) to eschew the big screen entirely, but on a Halloween weekend where big new releases are tougher sells for a horror-hungry crowd, it could lead to a decent audience. What they’ll be expecting from the rather huh-ly titled Paranormal Activity: Next of Kin might be rather different than what they end up getting though, a reboot with precious little in common with the films that have preceded it, just the title and the fact that there is some activity that is paranormal.The lack of sinew between this new chapter and the others implies that Paramount might be taking a page out of their own book and turning the series into a new Cloverfield, a banner brand that allows for different stories, tied only by genre. Without the franchise pull behind it, Next of Kin is a rather anonymous horror of demonic possession, competently made and with decent acting but indistinguishable from the pack, where predictability wins over personality.Next of Kin follows a woman named Margot (Emily Bader) who is searching for the truth behind her real family after she was left for adoption as a baby. Her documentary film-maker boyfriend Chris (Roland Buck III) follows her as she meets with a young Amish man who claims her mother was part of his secluded community. They return home with him but quickly discover that all is not what it seems.With such little thread between prior Paranormal movies and this one, it’s almost as if Next of Kin was found on a pile of scripts and then lazily rebranded. When in fact, it does share screenwriter Christoper Landon in common with chapters two, three and four, as well as spin-off, The Marked Ones. Landon has showcased his best work outside of the series with 2007’s lively Rear Window riff Disturbia and then last year’s hugely satisfying body swap comedy horror Freaky. There’s no such vibrancy here, just a familiar assembly job of cult panic and demons that go bump in the night, that has its moments (there are some jolting, if often laughably cheap, jump scares and a particularly nasty potato peeler incident) but it never lingers, spookily disappearing from our memories with haste.It’s more aesthetically polished than the majority of found footage films but as much as director William Eubank might be able to distract us visually, he can’t disguise the inevitable problem that so many of these moviesface. Back in the late 00s, at the height of the sub-genre’s ubiquity, when some nefarious force was assaulting our heroes, screams would often be silenced by the unavoidable question shouted in unison: “Why the hell are you still holding the damn camera?” It becomes increasingly exhausting and inexplicable here (along with the characters’ decision-making as a whole), as a literal demon is ripping people to shreds and takesus out of the horror unfolding in front, back into reality.A smarter film would have found a more believable justification for the inclusion of a camera up until the very end, but a smarter film would have also found a more believable justification for its existence in general. Next of Kin is a ho-hum franchise re-launcher that exists purely because, of course, it does.Paranormal Activity: Next of Kin is now available on Paramount+ with a UK date to be announced"
Army of Thieves review – fun Netflix prequel swaps horror for more heists,Zack Snyder’s surprisingly effective zombie caper Army of the Dead gets a zippy prequel that follows Matthias Schweighöfer’s unlikely safecracker,3,"There was a surprising amount of fun to be had in this summer’s gory zombie romp Army of the Dead, a film that turned the not-hugely-enticing prospect of Zack Snyder working with Netflix into something strangely hard-to-deny. It was his most ebulliently entertaining offering for years, and rightly predicting its popularity (it quickly became one of the streamer’s most-watched films ever), Snyder started developing a prequel called Army of Thieves months before it had even landed.The result is an unusual one, switching genre and director but maintaining the same rambunctious energy, a zippy adventure that pushes zombies to the background. While Army of the Dead was a horror movie with a heist, Army of Thieves is a heist movie without any horror, more formulaic and less memorable but still slickly effective, a strange next step for the Army franchise (a direct sequel and an anime prequel series are also on the way) that strangely works. Thieves follows Matthias Schweighöfer’s German safecracker Dieter before he ended up in Nevada, six years ago as the zombie outbreak began. We see it on TV screens and in dream sequences but never up-close, the characters amusingly unbothered by the impending apocalypse. Dieter is a safecracker only in theory, posting YouTube tutorials that nobody watches while going about his humdrum life as a lonely bank teller. But one day, he receives a mysterious message that leads him to Gwendoline (Game of Thrones alumna Nathalie Emmanuel), who enlists him as part of her crew of thieves (Guz Khan, Stuart Martin and Ruby O Fee) to crack the world’s most impossible safes.There’s nothing markedly necessary about universe expander Army of Thieves, niche fan service that gives backstory to a character who we know dies later on, but Schweighöfer, also acting as director, keeps his frothy caper afloat with a light knockabout tone, never insisting the film as anything that it isn’t. The script, from the Army of the Dead co-writer Shay Hatten, is stitched together from the heist movie playbook with no grand attempts to reinvent the genre, coasting on the simple pleasures of formula but he joins the dots with just about enough charm as we follow the ragtag team from city to city (a Netflix film with multiple locations is not to be sniffed at) and safe to safe. What the film does manage to bring to the table visually is a more immersive representation of what cracking a safe actually entails, some nifty effects taking us inside the mechanics of the safe as Dieter works his magic. It’s a neat trick that adds vibrancy to an often rather unengaging process.Schweighöfer’s goofy-but-goes-to-the-gym schtick is hard to resist, the kind of warm, well-calibrated performance that Ryan Reynolds often tries, and often fails, to give, and he’s as confident behind the camera as he is in front, buoyed by a grand Hans Zimmer score, a bold studio sizzle reel that should lead to more Hollywood work. Emmanuel, who showed romcom charm in 2019’s likable Four Weddings and a Funeral TV series, carries some of that through here for a sweet, if a little anemic, romance with Schweighöfer. It’s a little overlong for a film that should feel breezy, at over two hours, with the last act a little saggy as the inevitable double-crosses and “oh but that was really what was happening” reveals spill out (the narrative twists and turns are not quite as whip-smart as the film seems to think they are). But there’s an intriguingly doomed sadness that comes to the foreground at the very end, given the fate of Dieter’s character (recalling the finale of Black Widow), and it ends the film with a punch.There’s an immense satisfaction to relaxing into an old-fashioned genre film that’s content to hit simple, familiar beats with finesse, no more no less (something that also makes the streamer’s new western The Harder They Fall a winning watch), and the low stakes sturdiness of Army of Thieves marks it out as one of Netflix’s more enjoyable originals of late (it’s a heist movie about heists not a heist movie about, say, trauma). As the platform’s unending stream of cheaply made TV movies continues, here an important combination has been cracked.Army of Thieves is available on Netflix on 29 October"
Last Night in Soho review – Edgar Wright’s entertaining Valhalla of toxic 60s glitz,"Thomasin McKenzie, Anya Taylor-Joy and Matt Smith star in a horror-thriller that takes a trip to the sleazy heart of London’s past",3,"A trip to the dark heart of London’s unswinging 60s is what’s on offer in this entertaining, if uneven, film from screenwriter Krysty Wilson-Cairns and director Edgar Wright, serving up a gorgeous soundtrack and some marvellous re-creations of sleazy Soho and the West End. There’s a tremendous image of the marquee for the 1965 Thunderball premiere in Coventry Street, and a show-stopping crane shot of Soho Square, apparently filmed from where the 20th Century Fox sign is now no longer to be found atop that company’s former premises.Last Night in Soho is a doppelganger horror-thriller about a wide-eyed fashion student called Eloise (Thomasin McKenzie) who has brought her mum’s old Dansette record player and Cilla Black and Petula Clark LPs up to London from Cornwall on the train. Eloise has a fetish for the lost innocent glamour of the 60s but, moping all alone in her manky bedsit, finds herself stricken with nightly neon phantasms. Like a ghost from the future, Eloise dreams her way through a portal in time back into 60s London clubland, where she witnesses Sandie (Anya Taylor-Joy), a blonde singer – exactly the kind of retro showbiz princess Eloise moonily idolises – who is being forced by her slick-haired manager Jack (Matt Smith) into having sex for money with creepy old men. Gradually, Eloise feels her identity merging with Sandie’s. Is she having a breakdown, or is this nightmare really happening?Wright’s re-creation of that bygone half of the film is hypnotic: interestingly, Eloise’s bedsit is not in Soho, but just to the north in Fitzrovia; maybe for the Peeping Tom vibes, this being where Michael Powell’s classic 1960 London shocker was set. Eloise has a grumpy old landlady played with gusto by the late Diana Rigg, and there are other instances of 60s ancestor-worship casting, including ruined 60s cherub Terence Stamp as a mysterious old guy who hangs about by the pub.There are no cliched celeb cameos – no Francis Bacon in the Colony Room or Jimi Hendrix at the Bag O’Nails – and I like the way Wright does not romanticise or glamorise Soho: he shows us that this is a place of misogynistic nastiness. There is a grippingly squalid sequence in which Sandie is humiliatingly forced to participate as a chorus girl, performing Puppet on a String in a cringe-making saucy revue that is basically a prostitution shop-window for leering male punters in the audience, who are expecting Jack to set up a personal introduction. It’s a clever echo of the Christine Keeler revue scenes in Michael Caton-Jones’s Scandal from 1989.But the contemporary half of the film is for me less interesting, particularly in the overextended third act. It is almost as if the movie has used up all its horrified rapture on those vivid 1960s hallucinations, and it sometimes isn’t as scary as it could be. McKenzie does a lot of pop-eyed staring and sitting bolt upright in bed as she wakes up from another actually-happening bad dream, and there is a slightly laborious stretch where she is somehow able to research 60s Soho crime from microfiche newspaper records in her college library. In these book-lined stacks she suffers one of many ghost incursions. Taylor-Joy’s Sandie is opaque, but in the right way: the sacrificial fetish in a vortex of fear.None of this stops the Soho of the film from being re-created with great exuberance, a Valhalla of toxic glitz, whose world Wright directs with great style. Last Night in Soho is released on 29 October in cinemas."
Eternals review – magic hour meets PowerPoint in Chloe Zhao’s Marvel yarn,"The Nomadland director manages to get some nice-looking shots and personal drama in her superhero debut, but there’s just too much mythology to explain",2,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe as we know it is but a provincial backwater compared to the colossal scope of this latest addition, which covers such vast expanses of space and time that squeezing it all into one movie is almost a scientific breakthrough in itself. Everything about Eternals is huge, which is both its strength and its weakness. In terms of visual spectacle, it gives us cosmic vistas that would not look out of place on a prog-rock album cover or a documentary about the Big Bang. The story spans the entire globe and the entirety of human civilisation, from Mesopotamia to modern-day London, from the Australian outback to ancient Babylon, with innumerable CGI-heavy set pieces along the way. Sitting through the endless credits (which many will do to catch the very last bonus scene) you get the impression every VFX artist in the world was employed in making this. Some of their work is agreeably bizarre; some, it must be said, is downright terrible.Along with the epic scope comes an equally huge, and refreshingly diverse, cast of characters; these include Gemma Chan, Richard Madden, Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek and Kumail Nanjiani. There is also an epic mythology to get our heads around: even before a line of dialogue is spoken, three dense paragraphs of text explain how our 10 Eternals came to earth to protect it from the predatory Deviants (sort of skinless, sinewy beasts with prehensile tentacles) at the behest of Arishem, “the Prime Celestial”. If you’re lost already, bad luck: there’s plenty more to come, which demands some planet-sized chunks of exposition. At times if feels like you are watching a very sophisticated PowerPoint presentation.The Eternals have superpowers: Madden’s alpha-Eternal Ikaris can fly and shoots beams from his eyes, Jolie’s Thena fights with magic weapons, Lauren Ridloff’s Makkari is super-fast, and so on. But they are less your standard-issue Marvel superheroes than immortal, indestructible gods, who have been living among us incognito for the past 7,000 years. “Why didn’t you help fight Thanos?” one ordinary human reasonably asks. Eternals can only intervene when Deviants are involved, they say. Like the Wakandans in Black Panther, the Eternals are divided over how to apply their superiority. Power, responsibility, loyalty and unity are overriding themes. But there are very few moments when these immortals actually come into contact with humans, which makes their plight feel somewhat abstract. It’s only when the Eternals’ own fates are jeopardised that they really take an interest in saving us little people. To reveal more would be spoiling the plot’s surprises, and would require explaining terms such as “the Emergence”, “the Mahd Wy’ry” and “the Uni-Mind”.It’s certainly… different. One of Eternals’ biggest surprises is its director: Chloé Zhao, who won two Oscars earlier this year for Nomadland, her lyrical, semi-documentary survey of America in the here and now. There are superficial aesthetic similarities – a lot of magic-hour sunset scenes – but the two films could not be more different. The trademark of Zhao’s previous work was their intimacy and realism. Eternals is a gigantic exercise in un-realism.Zhao at least manages to ground the story in some personal drama. The film’s emotional centre is Chan’s matter-transforming Sersi who must reassemble the Eternals in the face of a new threat, although she’s still smarting from her recent break-up with Madden’s Ikaris. (By “recent”, we’re talking 2000 years ago.) Lia McHugh’s Sprite also holds a candle for Ikaris, but being trapped in the body of an 11-year-old girl puts her at a disadvantage. There’s an un-Marvel-like sex scene between two naked people, and a gay character kisses their same-sex partner – although both these moments are fleeting. Nanjiani provides some much-needed comic relief as Eternal-turned-Bollywood movie star Kingo (though Harish Patel as his documentary-shooting “valet” feels like a misstep). Jolie’s real-life star power is somewhat dimmed by her character’s unconvincing personality disorder. And some of the minor Eternals barely get time to make an impression.That’s the problem: there’s just too much going on: it’s all headed towards yet another “race against time to stop the really bad thing happening” climax. It’s not exactly boring – there’s always something new to behold – but nor it is particularly exciting, and it lacks the breezy wit of Marvel’s best movies. One of the strengths of the MCU to date is how it has taken time to define each character individually and lay out the grand narratives over successive movies, building a sense of momentum. Here, it’s all thrown at us at once. It’s like coming into Avengers: Endgame cold without having seen any of the preceding instalments. Most mortals will simply find it too much. Bigger isn’t always better. Eternals is released on 4 November in Australia, and 5 November in the US and UK."
That Thing You Do!: Tom Hanks’ directorial debut is still an effervescent pop music romp,"It’s less sex, drugs and rock’n’roll than sentimentality, but after 25 years there’s still joy to be found in the tale of a 60s era four-piece catapulted to stardom",0," That Thing You Do! is streaming in Australia on Disney+. For more recommendations of what to stream in Australia, click hereThat Thing You Do! is a charming, nostalgic look at a fictitious pop group in the 1960s, as four fresh-faced lads from small town USA unexpectedly score a hit song, taking them from relative obscurity to overnight stardom. Written by Tom Hanks in his directorial debut, he also takes a supporting role in this 1996 film which blends humour and heartache as the band ride the wave of fame off their one-hit wonder.The smart and sensitive Guy (a Tom Hanks doppelganger played by Tom Everett Scott) is about to be dumped by his almost-girlfriend, Tina (Charlize Theron, in one of her first Hollywood roles) when he is approached with the opportunity to join a band. The Oneders (pronounced the Wonders, but comically mispronounced as the O-Need-ers for the first half of the film) are in desperate need of a new drummer for a talent show performance after their usual fourth, Chad (Giovanni Ribisi), breaks his arm in a foolish mishap.Joining lead singer Jimmy (Johnathon Schaech), lead guitarist Lenny (played with wry, comedic wit by the scene-stealing Steve Zahn) and bass player (the delightful Ethan Embry, whose character is never given a name, in a cheeky nod to that one seemingly anonymous member of every band) for a quick rehearsal in a garage, Guy is introduced to the title track as an easy-listening ballad. On the day of the talent show, however, Guy decides to set a much quicker tempo for the song, forcing the rest of the band to adapt their playing to match and the dance floor swells in response.Jimmy, the talented, arrogant, self-appointed decision maker with the perfect Beatles quiff, is noticeably annoyed that he wasn’t consulted, marking the first of many clashes at the expense of his ego. But in this universe, the drummer is the star – the backbone, the timekeeper. And in That Thing You Do! it’s the nice guy who’s celebrated.Hanks directs with a gentle, unforced touch, aided by his likeable cast. He steps out from behind the camera around a third of the way through the film as a slick and savvy industry manager, who guides the newly minted Wonders through rapidly escalating popularity as That Thing You Do! storms the charts, their fame crystallising with their first TV appearance. The bright, colourful set design and decidedly groovy 60s era costumes (thanks to designer Colleen Atwood) all add to the authenticity of this fictional yet familiar past, whilst Hanks cleverly peppers the script with cultural references and optimism.Joining them through every show and tour is Jimmy’s girlfriend, Faye, played with wide-eyed innocence and suitable girl-next-door appeal by Liv Tyler. One of the standout scenes is Tyler and the rest of the gang joyously reacting as the band hears their signature tune on the radio for the first time – the kind of effervescent and joyful scene that only Hanks could deliver without a hint of derision.The established conflict between Guy and Jimmy continues to face hurdles as their manager stacks the cards against Jimmy, who becomes increasingly at odds with his band mates and his girlfriend. As Jimmy becomes progressively frustrated at the levity of their rise in fame rather than revelling in it, cracks between the group and their individual ambitions begin to appear. At times mirroring the duality of the ridiculousness and reverence of their career opportunity, the seething continues as it sets up Jimmy as the group’s bad boy v the perennial good Guy. Or perhaps in this Beatles-esque universe, it’s Schaech’s Lennon to Scott’s McCartney.It’s less sex, drugs and rock’n’roll and more a tale built on sentimentality tempered with a dose of reality. But for all the enthusiasm for the rise from obscurity to superstardom in this story, That Thing You Do! is also a sanitised cautionary tale about the many pitfalls of the music industry.This year marks the 25th anniversary of this feel-good ode to the magic of music, with the soundtrack reportedly going platinum not long ago a just reward given the title track was nominated for best original song at the 1997 Academy Awards. Composer Adam Schlesinger, who passed away in April 2020 due to Covid-19, crafted a genuinely catchy, melodic and convincingly nostalgia track, with the power to drive a movie built on the notion that one truly great song can change lives."
Playlist review – appealingly gauche French twentysomething romance,A young woman dreams of working as an artist – and finding a man – in Nine Antico’s feature debut,3,"The latest addition to the rudderless, chaotic, twentysomething Frenchwoman genre – the Gallic pixie dreamgirl, if you will – Playlist suffers a little in comparison to Léonor Serraille’s similarly Paris-set Jeune Femme from 2018, not least because that film’s charismatic star, Laetitia Dosch, has a supporting role in this one. But Sara Forestier is likable enough as the somewhat hapless Sophie, who dreams of working as an artist but whose main preoccupation is finding a man.The film’s black-and-white cinematography – presumably a reference to the graphic novels that Sophie admires – adds little to the film, but the soundtrack, featuring repeated use of True Love Will Find You in the End by Daniel Johnston, brings an appealingly gauche quality to the story.In cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema"
The Boss Baby 2: Family Business review – needs a nap,Infants turn app designers in this sugar-rush sequel definitely aimed at a young audience,2,"Put an infinite number of babies in a room with tablets and they may, as posited by this frenetic sequel to the 2017 animation, dream up hugely successful apps. More likely, though, they would binge on sugar-based snack foods and spend 107 minutes bouncing off the walls, which is essentially the approach taken here. The film reunites the now adult protagonists of the first film – estranged brothers Ted (Alec Baldwin) and Tim (James Marsden) – and shrinks them back to baby size in order to investigate a suspicious instance of educational hothousing at a primary school.The pro-family, anti-tech messaging is designed to play to the parents, but while not entirely unwatchable, the film’s demented levels of energy will recommend it to younger audiences and may trigger stress headaches in anyone over 12."
After We Fell review – Harry Styles-inspired romance is stupendously wooden,"Fans of the YA After series should find something amid the tangled mess of plot, daytime-soap acting and inanimate passion – everyone else should look away",1,"If you don’t identify as an Afternator or recognise the hashtag #Hessa, a short explanation is necessary. After is a clutch of bestselling YA romance novels once described as “Fifty Shades of Grey for teens”. US author Anna Todd started writing stories as fan fiction for the boyband One Direction and Harry Styles is the inspiration for broody-eyed bad-boy Hardin Scott; he’s the on-off boyfriend of bookish virginal college student Tessa Young. This film is the stupendously wooden and humourless third in the series. It’s heading straight to Amazon and should come with a warning to viewers: contains extremely boring sex.If you’re new to the franchise, don’t even bother trying. The script works on the basis that everyone watching has read the books, seen the previous movies and bought the T-shirt (sloganned versions available on Etsy: “Mentally dating Hardin Scott”). No attempt whatsoever is made to introduce us to the tedious tangle of relationships. That said, all you need to know about Tessa and Hardin is that they can’t live without each other.The latest crisis is whether Tessa moving to Seattle to work for a swanky publishing company will destroy their relationship. Josephine Langford is dewy-skinned Tessa, who spends the film smiling a bland people-pleasing smile. Hardin is played by British actor Hero Fiennes Tiffin, the son of director Martha and nephew of Ralph and Joseph. (My burning question is whether any of the other Fiennes have ever watched these movies? We need a Gogglebox episode of a family screening.)The acting is daytime-soap standard and the tasteful, softcore sex is shot in such a way as to not look like actual sex. It’s unerotic, unsweaty and performed with expressionless faces. It feels like the film-makers know they have to do the sex bits, but don’t really want to actually do them. In one scene Hardin turns up the bubbles on a hot tub with a suggestive eyebrow waggle. “Oooh, that’s nice,” coos Tessa, as if he’s just passed her the custard creams.

The Bacchus Lady review – Youn Yuh-jung leads tale of life on the margins in Seoul,The Oscar winner is a compelling lead in an unconventional drama about an ageing prostitute in the Korean capital,3,"Youn Yuh-jung made history earlier this year by becoming the first Korean to win an acting Oscar, for her role as the bluff, pro-wrestling-loving grandma in the Korean-American drama Minari. But following a long career break after her boundary-pushing 1960s appearances, she had already built up strong previous form playing other unconventional late-life characters back in Asia. In this 2016 drama, her long face and semaphoric blink are put to strong use playing an elderly prostitute in Seoul – she is a “Bacchus lady”, named for the energy drink the ladies pep their clients up with.Youn’s character, So-Young, is at a clinic dealing with an occupational hazard – being diagnosed with gonorrhoea – when her doctor is stabbed by his Filipino lover, who claims he is refusing to pay alimony for their child Min-ho (Choi Hyun-jun). After the woman is arrested, So-Young takes it upon herself to look after the child – communicating with the broken English she learned working as a prostitute on US military bases. After this typically Korean pileup of calamity and farce, The Bacchus Lady subsides into something more reflective and mournful. Youn insists that her vagina is “still young” – but her assignments with johns seem to consist as much of consoling them about their fading years as the sex.In The Bacchus Lady, writer-director E J-yong is clearly going to bat for the country’s disenfranchised and marginalised. (Korea has the highest senior-age poverty rate among OECD countries.) Outside of the protective circle with whom she lives – a bench-pressing amputee (Yoon Kye-sang) and a transgender club singer (An A-zu) – So-Young has to face down demeaning assignments, an exploitative journalist looking to make a documentary and the condescending children of Song, a dying former client she visits in hospitals.The social satire of the latter scenes is a bit on the nose, showing up E’s sometimes flaky tonal hand; something that becomes more detrimental when Song co-opts So-Young as a reluctant euthaniser. The film arguably has too much going on – including another digression about a long-lost son So-Young had with an American soldier – to let this morbid side meaningfully register, or fully explore its other facets. But it’s still a worthwhile, idiosyncratic film anchored with charismatic resignation by Youn. The Bacchus Lady is available on 23 October on Mubi and screens as part of the London Korean film festival on 6 November."
Warning review – sci-fi anthology like Black Mirror sketches that didn’t make the cut,Connected stories of a doomed AI-human hybrid future struggle to hang together,2,"Set in a not-so-distant future, this frayed assemblage of vaguely interconnected skits plays like ideas Charlie Brooker had while tipsy for episodes of Black Mirror, then crumpled up and threw in his waste basket. But those ideas were retrieved, storyboarded, and shot by student film-makers whose underpaid tutors weren’t around to say keep working on this script until you have something interesting.The opening sequence, which comes back throughout, concerns an astronaut in outer space named David (Thomas Jane), who is doing a routine repair on a satellite when a power surge sets him adrift with only an AI link for company. As he floats in space, using up his last days of oxygen, he monologues about his regrets in life, talks to God and ponders what’s going on back on Earth (where electrical storms presage environmental disaster). On our home planet, a sad-eyed robot shelter attendant (the wonderful Tomasz Kot from Cold War, incongruously named Brian despite a thick Polish accent) tries to interest customers in an elderly, doddery android named Charlie (Rupert Everett) who tells lame jokes and can’t fix much and therefore is hard to adopt out.Elsewhere, a young woman (Alice Eve) tries to get her Alexa/Siri-like AI assistant (that’s simply called God) fixed so she can go back to having a household deity; a guy (Patrick Schwarzenegger) stalks his ex-girlfriend (Kylie Bunbury) using an Oculus-like headset; and the heir to a wealthy family of immortals (Alex Pettyfer) brings home his mortal girlfriend (Annabelle Wallis) to meet the family, making for a decidedly awkward dinner party. In the longest segment, a young woman (Garance Marillier, from Raw) agrees to rent out her body to an old man she’s been matched up with online, but not in the way you might think: his mind will actually inhabit her body, giving him a chance to enjoy a night of partying with young people in a luxurious hotel.It all works up to an only mildly surprising “shock” ending, which is bad news for all concerned, a twist that would be more tragic if it were possible to feel sorry for any of them. Warning is released on 25 October on digital platforms."
Disobedience: Rachels Weisz and McAdams bring a forbidden love back to life,A woman’s prodigal return to the Orthodox Jewish community of her youth rekindles more than just old friendships,0," Disobedience is available to stream in Australia on Netflix. For more recommendations of what to stream in Australia, click hereThis enthralling, disarming story about rekindled love, set in a London Orthodox Jewish community, may be the perfect way to spend just shy of two hours.Disobedience is based on the Orange prize-winning 2006 novel by Naomi Alderman, a former member of a London Jewish Orthodox community. The story is deftly executed by Chilean film-maker Sebastián Lelio in his first English-language film, co-written with Rebecca Lenkiewicz.Ronit (Rachel Weisz) is a New York City portrait photographer who returns to the Orthodox Jewish community of her youth after hearing that her father, a much-cherished rabbi (Anton Lesser), has passed away. Her grief is introduced to the viewer with a fascinating juxtaposition of scenes: Ronit receives the phone call, has a drink in a bar, has sex in a toilet stall, and goes ice-skating.Ronit’s prodigal return to London is met with distaste by certain members of her former community. She is invited to stay by childhood friend Dovid (Alessandro Nivola), who is now a rabbi, and married to Esti (Rachel McAdams). It’s immediately clear that Ronit and Esti have one hell of a past, and also that they haven’t shaken their immense magnetic pull towards each other.Disobedience unfurls languidly at times, but aptly so: the scenes are sublimely orchestrated by Lelio. The acting is utterly mesmerising too – these performers know how to lean into tension as they navigate the triggers and pains of their characters. And it’s shaky ground that they tread, as the rigidity of Esti’s day-to-day life is inevitably tested by Ronit’s return.Throughout the film, issues centring on duty, desire and identity all feel deeply personal to observe. Weisz steeps Ronit’s delicately nuanced grief and heartbreak in a concoction of anger, regret and validation. McAdams’ Esti is a layered performance that surpasses her impressive depth in previous roles like Spotlight. Nivola may have had a choice to play out Dovid’s myriad of conflicts in a more overt way, but his handling of Dovid’s journey is delicate and quietly raw.Disobedience was released theatrically in 2018 and was nominated for five British independent film awards, with Nivola winning for best supporting actor. In addition to its warm reception on the festival circuit, it was also lauded for its portrayal of the rekindled eroticism and passion between Ronit and Esti.Disobedience is now sitting pretty in the Netflix catalogue, among many other independent drama gems. Lucky for us. Such an absorbing study of desire and self-sacrifice, it’s a story that has a kind of staying power made all the more potent by watching it in the quiet of the home."
The Man from the Future by Ananyo Bhattacharya review – the life of John von Neumann,"An expert on everything from game theory to Byzantine history, the inspiration for Dr Strangelove was as brilliant as he was dangerous",0,"“A quaint and ceremonious village of puny demigods on stilts,” wrote Albert Einstein to the queen of Belgium. It was November 1933 and Einstein had been in Princeton, New Jersey, for just a month having left Europe after the Nazis’ rise to power. The celebrated physicist wasn’t referring to the ordinary citizens of the famous university town but to some of his new colleagues.Einstein’s recruitment by the Institute for Advanced Study was like a modern-day star signing for a football club backed by a Russian oligarch. His presence there soon attracted a stellar collection of mathematicians. The brightest of these was a 30-year-old Hungarian.John von Neumann was a mathematical prodigy who published his first paper at 18. As far removed from the caricature of the bookish, socially awkward mathematician as possible, he was a charming, party-loving, hard-drinking raconteur who mastered ancient Greek, Latin, French, German, English and Hungarian as a child growing up in Budapest. He was also capable of chillingly cold calculation, and an attitude to human life in the context of the cold war that can seem breathtaking in its ruthlessness. Nevertheless, despite being the real-life model for Stanley Kubrick’s Dr Strangelove, he helped usher in the computer age.There was certainly no doubt about his intellect. To entertain his friends, he would recite verbatim passages from books read years before. An unnamed historian, so the story goes, would only attend one of Von Neumann’s legendary parties if they didn’t discuss Byzantine history, since he wanted to maintain his reputation as the world’s foremost expert.Non-Euclidean geometry, set theory, the prisoner’s dilemma, Gödel’s incompleteness theorems, self-replicating machines, game theory and nonlocality are among the astonishing range of topics that science journalist Ananyo Bhattacharya covers as he takes us on a whistle-stop tour through Von Neumann’s restless mind. It was after tackling some of the most vexing questions in mathematics that Von Neumann turned his attention to physics and did something quite remarkable.With his extraordinary capacity to see beyond the superficial complexities of a problem and break it down to its most fundamental form, Von Neumann reduced quantum mechanics to its essentials, and in the process showed that two competing formulations of the theory – Erwin Schrödinger’s wave mechanics and Werner Heisenberg’s matrix mechanics – were, in fact, one and the same. It was a result that inspired him to build the first rigorous framework for the new science of the atomic realm.During the second world war, Von Neumann quickly became an expert in the science of ballistics and explosions. Brought in as a consultant to the Manhattan Project, the top-secret effort to make an atomic bomb, he worked out the best way to detonate it. Solving the equations required extensive number crunching with the aid of mechanical desk calculators. Looking at ways to speed up the time-consuming work, Von Neumann came across the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, a machine being developed for the army to compute firing tables for artillery. You could almost live inside the ENIAC, as it occupied a room 30 feet wide and 56 feet long. It consisted of some 18,000 vacuum tubes and banks of wiring and switches arranged in panels 8 feet tall. Von Neumann helped turn it into the world’s first programmable digital computer.In an effort to understand conflict and cooperation, Von Neumann co-wrote a 640-page book on game theory, which had a huge impact on economics, psychology and military strategy. He applied game theory to nuclear war, openly advocating a pre-emptive strike on the Soviet Union. “With the Russians it is not a question of whether but when,” he told Life magazine. “If you say: ‘Why not bomb them tomorrow,’ I say: ‘Why not today?’ If you say: ‘Today at 5 o’clock,’ I say: ‘Why not one o’clock?’” He may have been prepared to send humanity back to the stone age but, as revealed in this splendid new biography, Von Neumann did much to create the world we live in now.

Arracht review – Irish-language murder ballad of famine and injustice,"Director Tomás Ó Súilleabháin’s beautifully shot film takes on one man’s battle with the British, but without judgment",3,"It’s 1847: an Irishman sings a murder ballad about folk hero Colmán Sharkey, a peasant who shot dead his landlord. But the story that emerges in this tough atmospheric drama is that the killing did not go down like that. Set during the potato famine, Arracht is in Gaelic with English subtitles (it was Ireland’s foreign film Oscar entry) and stars Dónall Ó Héalai as Connemara fisherman and farmer Colmán, who brews poteen on the side to trade in the village. His character is unsatisfactorily written, to be honest: too saintly by half, he won’t touch a drop of his own liquor and there are a few too many scenes of him doting on his wife and his baby son.The film opens two years before the ballad, at the beginning of the great famine. Colmán finds his potatoes rotting in the field, afflicted with potato blight. At the same time his Anglo-Irish landlord (Michael McElhatton) is putting up the rates; Colmán decides to pay him a visit to reason with him. Director Tomás Ó Súilleabháin plays out these scenes brilliantly: rather than make the landlord a cruel, easy-to-hate villain, he’s instead monumentally clueless. Colmán warns him that half the village will be in their graves by spring. Nonsense, exclaims the landlord, and in a let-them-eat-cake moment explains that a little hardship will be good for the people and will wean them off their dependency on potato crops.After a massacre in the landlord’s house, Colmán goes on the run, hiding out in a cave for two years, where he takes in a half-starved orphan girl. And here Arracht begins to look like a survival movie, the wild wintry Galway coastline beautifully shot by Kate McCullough. Ó Héalai dropped four stones for the film and he looks the part, scarily emaciated, cheeks hollowed out. But for me, these stretches of Colmán in the elements, smoking fish and grinding seaweed into medicine, took the power and intensity down a notch or two. Arracht is released on 15 October in cinemas."
The Phantom of the Open review – Brit sporting underdog movie right on par,"Mark Rylance stars in this amiably daft film about real-life golfing eccentric Maurice Flitcroft, who gatecrashed the British Open in the 70s",3,"Here’s a film about a guy who likes six sugars in his tea – and the viewer might also need a bit of a sweet tooth. It is an amiably daft and sentimental Britfilm, a comedy of the underdog starring Mark Rylance, based on the strange true story of Maurice Flitcroft, a Barrow-in-Furness shipyard worker and amateur golfer who took up the sport in middle-age. Flitcroft practised on the beach, and became known for cheekily entering the British Open golf championship in 1976 as a self-declared professional, thus circumventing the handicap requirement for amateurs. He found himself competing with the likes of Seve Ballesteros, but chaotically chalked up the worst score in the tournament’s history, to the spluttering rage of the puce-faced, blazer-wearing gentlemen in charge. They tried to ban him but he kept on gatecrashing competitions with wacky disguises and fake names.This movie about him has been written for the screen by Simon Farnaby – based on the 2010 book of the same name that he co-wrote with Guardian writer Scott Murray – and directed by Craig Roberts. Flitcroft is played by Rylance as an eccentric holy innocent; his long-suffering and affectionate wife is played by Sally Hawkins; and Rhys Ifans is the pop-eyed, pompous club secretary.Now, maybe this casting feels a bit inevitable, and maybe the Britfilm template itself feels a bit inevitable. We’ve already had a movie inspired by Eddie the Eagle, whose entry into the Winter Olympics as a ski-jumper in 1988 depended, like Flitcroft’s escapade, on exploiting a loophole in the rules. Dream Horse was a more heartfelt true story about a community that bought a Welsh Grand National winner. It could be that this film downplays Maurice’s life as a prankster and hoaxer and skates over the stranger and more anarchic side of his personality, playing up instead the underlying sincerity of his dream of becoming a golfer, and his hurt feelings when the press and media mocked him. Or this may be nothing more than the truth. It could well be that Flitcroft brazened it all out and made a show of his outrageous exploits to mask how upset he was with not really being good at golf.The script takes up an interesting point from Maurice: why shouldn’t the British Open be like the FA Cup, where little clubs are allowed to take on the big names? Could it be that British golf is a festival of class entitlement to which Maurice was not admitted, and that maybe his interest in the sport needn’t have been a big joke? Maybe he had a real talent, which could have been nurtured if things had been different?Maybe. Rylance is good casting as Maurice: his delicate sing-song voice and sometimes faintly unfocused gaze fit nicely with our hero’s lovably awkward determination, as well as Flitcroft’s sense as a natural comedian that there is something more than a little absurd in the game of golf. The Phantom of the Open screened at the London film festival and is released on 18 March in the UK."
Never Gonna Snow Again review – rich brew of strangeness in unsettling suburbia,A mysterious masseur visits a dysfunctional gated community in this absorbing Polish fairytale,4,"There’s a rich confectionery of strangeness, sadness and fear to this very absorbing film by the Polish film-maker Małgorzata Szumowska, co-writing and directing with cinematographer Michał Englert. The title, incidentally, relates to a purported theory declaimed deadpan over the closing credits that there will be no snowfall after the year 2025 due to the climate crisis. (I don’t know if that’s true, but I’ve never been so scared in my life. Perhaps this film should be played to the delegates at the Cop26 UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, so they can all be terrified into action.)The setting is an eerily blank suburban scene: a smug, prosperous but dysfunctional community in a gated development, with identical white McMansion-style houses whose occupants all have their own secrets. It is in fact the Ventana housing estate in Walendów, eastern Poland, a place that looks so weirdly uniform that an overhead shot makes it look like a model, and a plotline about teenagers manufacturing drugs put me in mind of American Beauty, just a little.The bored and unsatisfied inhabitants are all of a-flutter, due to a Ukrainian masseur called Zhenia (Alec Utgoff), who comes to people’s houses with his foldaway massage table and administers physio- and hypnotherapy and works wonders. Zhenia’s ministrations are electrifying everyone. But as it happens, Zhenia comes from Chernobyl, and he is plagued with agonised dreams and memories of his mother, and of the clouds of radioactive dust that looked like snow to him. As Zhenia makes his house calls in the suburbs, autumn turns to winter, Halloween comes and goes and Christmas is on the way, but it doesn’t snow, no matter how bitterly cold it gets.There is some awful psychic pain in the air: Zhenia can sense it. Perhaps he can cure it. But perhaps it will involve some great sacrifice. Utgoff’s presence is distinctly unsettling: he looks innocent, idealistic, faintly pained and ascetic, with a dancer’s grace and a robot’s mystery. He is perhaps a little like Terence Stamp in Pasolini’s Theorem, but far more sweet-natured and less intimidating. This is a fairytale: but a fantasy with solidity and form. Never Gonna Snow Again is released on 15 October in cinemas."
The Ape Woman review – freakshow satire with bizarre alternative-ending payoff,Watching both versions of this 1964 drama of Elephant Man-style exploitation reveals an impressive degree of tenderness and complexity,5,"Marco Ferreri’s 1964 movie La Donna Scimmia (The Ape Woman) is a bizarre satire whose effect depends on keeping you unsure how bizarre and how satirical it is supposed to be. This is due to the vivid streak of sentimental tragicomedy that runs through the film – in fact, through both versions of the film that were made, and that now have now been included on the Blu-ray and digital versions of this release. Producer Carlo Ponti persuaded the director to create a “happy ending” version so the film could be entered for the Cannes film festival, and there is the original version Ferreri shot with its much darker ending. But you have to watch both; this dual narrative gives the film a new tenderness and complexity.The Ape Woman is inspired by the true story of Julia Pastrana, a 19th-century Mexican indigenous woman with hypertrichosis, a condition that meant hair covered her entire body. Like the “Elephant Man”, she was exploited as a fairground freak. Ferreri’s drama, set in the present day of 1964, gives us a roguish, seedy entrepreneur called Antonio, played by Ugo Tognazzi, who has brought his slide projector to a nunnery in Naples to put on a supposedly improving and educational show about missionaries in Africa. In the convent’s kitchens, he discovers a cringing young novitiate, Maria (Annie Girardot), who is ashamed of being freakishly covered in hair. Antonio chivvies and charms the poor girl and persuades the sisters to let him take her home, finally agreeing to marry her so he can put on a rackety backstreet show in a converted warehouse in which she must caper around, in and out of a cage, pretending to be an ape, while Antonio cracks a whip and tells the gawping crowds he found her in Africa.Soon Maria becomes more confident in her performance and local impresario Majeroni (Achille Majeroni) brings their preposterous act to Paris, repurposed as an exotic striptease routine. Maria becomes pregnant; in one reality she and her hirsute baby die wretchedly in childbirth, but in the other version she survives, with a normal baby. However, the experience causes her own excess hair to fall out and she becomes just like any wife and mother, while Antonio humbly submits to taking a normal job at the docks. It isn’t a question of one ending being better or more authentic than the other: they have to be consumed in parallel.Twenty-first century audiences will, understandably, see The Ape Woman as a satire on misogyny, racism and exploitation. Also it is comparable, in its surreal challenge to good taste, to Tod Browning’s 1932 film Freaks, or Nagisa Oshima’s Max Mon Amour from 1986, with a woman taking a chimp as her lover. It is also reminiscent of the MC’s creepy song in Cabaret with his ape-faced lover: “If you could see her through my eyes … she wouldn’t look Jewish at all.” But it is also clearly intended in other, less readable ways: as a broadly heartwarming, if strange cautionary tale of hubris, redemption and love.There are some amazing moments in The Ape Woman: particularly Antonio and Maria’s wedding, when he takes her outside to parade through the streets while she sings the bridal song through a microphone. And their striptease has something very desolate, with its grisly new sexiness betokening what we now have no choice but to see as a loss of innocence.Maybe the time has come to see this film not as a black comic provocation, but something to put alongside Fellini’s La Strada, something intimate, a vision of uxorious poignancy with its alternate realities: Antonio rescuing his wife’s mummified dead body from the museum so he can continue doing a grisly sideshow with it, and Antonio meeting his wife and child for lunch while he toils at the docks. Ferrera (and Ponti) somehow created something daringly postmodern. The Ape Woman is on digital platforms and on Blu-Ray from 11 October."
Fever Dream review – a beautiful and bonkers future cult classic,Director Claudia Llosa returns to form with a woozy work about a cosy domesticity in rural Argentina shattered by uncanny intruders,4,"After making high-arthouse awards-magnet The Milk of Sorrow in her native Peru in 2009, director Claudia Llosa stumbled in 2014 with her first English-language feature, Aloft which, despite its title, failed to take flight. And while seven years isn’t that long a time between films these days in the world of indie cinema, Fever Dream, feels like a return from a distant wilderness. Distribution via Netflix after a premiere at the San Sebastián film festival and short cinema run may be a decent strategy for this future cult classic – it’s a film that plays remarkably well on TV screens, especially if viewed alone late at night, as it’s all about a cosy domesticity that’s suddenly cruelly pierced by uncanny intruders.Set in rural Argentina although apparently shot in Chile, the story revolves around the encounter between two very different mothers. The more affluent Amanda (María Valverde) has come to the area for a summer holiday with her even-tempered little girl Nina (Guillermina Sorribes Liotta), while her husband Marco (Guillermo Pfening) stays at home, perpetually preoccupied with work. Amanda first meets her neighbour, local beauty Carola (Dolores Fonzi), when she arrives bearing buckets of water, warning that the stuff out of the tap isn’t always fit to drink. It transpires that Carola also has a child, David (wide-eyed Emilio Vodanovich), who is so altered in the wake of a childhood illness that his mother claims he’s not even her son, his soul having migrated somewhere else and left the body behind.And so begins a woozy work not quite like anything else – except perhaps for Llosa’s previous films, which also revolved around anguished mothers, enigmatic faith healers and a natural world teeming with splendours and malignancy. The pacing is stately and staccato all at once, and viewers allergic to lashings of voiceover are advised to stay away. The whole thing unfolds via a dialogue between Amanda and David in a conversation we only hear but can’t see or even fully understand. Meanwhile, gifted British composer Natalie Holt, whose eclectic CV includes scores for Paddington as well as the recent TV series Loki, weaves in a string-led score that evokes Max Richter at his most romantic as well as the chittering of exotic birds. There are some extraordinary images along the way – for instance, of a man tending a horse seen in silhouette that looks at first like a centaur – which sits flush with the whole theme of transmigrated souls and bestial people. The whole thing is a bit bonkers but very beautiful too. Fever Dream is released on 6 October in cinemas and on 13 October on Netflix."
My Little Sister review – fierce and fraught family drama,Nina Hoss and Lars Eidinger give finely acted performances as they play twins brought back together through illness – but who is saving who?,3,"Fine performances are at the heart of this film from Swiss writer-directors Véronique Reymond and Stéphanie Chuat, which rather resembles a classy television drama that might, in British terrestrial terms, be spread over three successive Sundays.Nina Hoss plays Lisa, an author and dramatist suffering from an emotional and professional block. Her life is on hold because her beloved twin brother Sven (Lars Eidinger), a celebrated classical stage actor in Berlin, has cancer, though he is now in remission due to the bone marrow transplant which she has been able to give him. Lisa comes to the clinic to bring him back temporarily to the chaotic family apartment in the city where their widowed mother Kathy (Marthe Keller) lives. The film’s original title is Schwesterlein and when we first see Sven he is sitting on the hospital bed with his headphones on, listening to Brahms’s song: “Schwesterlein, Schwesterlein, wann gehn wir nach Haus?” (“Little sister, little sister, when are we going home?”)Clearly, living in Berlin isn’t feasible for Sven at present. An understudy has temporarily taken his role of Hamlet in the current production which Sven made a success, so he agrees to stay with Lisa and her somewhat strait-laced husband Martin (played by the Danish actor Jens Albinus) and their two children at their home in the picture-perfect Swiss alpine village of Leysin on Lake Geneva, where Martin is the headteacher of a prestigious private school and Lisa teaches literature. But wild, passionate, bohemian Sven, in his comical fright-wig to conceal his baldness, hates the sterility of the surroundings. He is angry at being cut off from his artistic lifeblood and this upends Lisa’s already fraught marriage.Easily the best scene in the film comes when Sven shows up at the theatre as a (not entirely welcome) surprise while the cast of Hamlet and the understudy are rehearsing, and he bursts on to the stage, unannounced, declaiming his lines. The cast are uneasy at Sven’s brilliance, his obvious anger at having the role taken away from him and his frailty – he could collapse at any time. He looks like what he is: a cancer patient. Famously, Eidinger played Hamlet on stage in Berlin and the few lines he delivers here are compelling.The film shows us a relationship rarely represented in the movies: the brother-sister relationship. And maybe what Lisa has to confront over the course of the movie is that this is the most important relationship in her life: more important than her marriage, and complicated still further by the fact that she was once romantically involved with David (Thomas Ostermeier), the theatre director who now has the job of telling Sven that his temporary withdrawal from the cast is going to be permanent. In her anguish, Lisa begins a new work: a chamber piece inspired by Hansel and Gretel, the legendary siblings under threat, which she still believes Sven could perform. This will give Sven a reason to live, and revive Lisa’s own vocation.Lisa and Sven’s closeness was perhaps always going to exclude everyone else, especially when Lisa’s bone marrow transplant wedded her to him in a uniquely, tragically intimate way. Perhaps ironically it means that the parallel plot about Lisa’s own discontent at living as the headmaster’s wife in antiseptic Switzerland is rather underpowered – and of course there is the fact that Eidinger tends to upstage everyone else on screen with him.Has Lisa, at some unconscious level, come to welcome Sven’s illness as a way of freeing herself of her domestic dullness, especially when she conceives the idea of writing a new piece especially for him, to rescue them both? It’s a fierce, thoughtful drama. My Little Sister is released on 8 October in cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema."
Father of the Cyborgs review – the Indiana Jones of neuroscience,"This film exploring the ideas of Dr Phil Kennedy, who had an electrode implanted in his brain, throws up interesting prospects for the human future",3,"Dr Phil Kennedy is regarded by many as the Indiana Jones of neuroscience: a Limerick-born doctor who became a bioengineering trailblazer, making people excited – and then nervous – by the way he worked outside the system. Then finally, sensationally, he experimented on himself by having an electrode implanted inside his brain in a Belize clinic that specialises in medical tourism.Kennedy did this to measure the ways in which brainwaves can be harnessed to external computing capacity, helping people with locked-in syndrome or ALS, for example, although what was specifically achieved by implant surgery on himself isn’t clear. This brief documentary is a partial introduction to the man and his work and it seeks to rescue Kennedy from his wacky reputation, to downplay the maverick side of his personality (there is no mention of his self-published sci-fi novel called 2051) and it doesn’t dwell on the fact that Kennedy is now regarded as somewhat eccentric by mainstream neuroscientists – although disruptors, pioneers and original thinkers are very often people just like him.This film about him provides food for thought, though: authors such as Mark O’Connell are interviewed about the prospects for techno-homo sapiens, a transhuman evolutionary phase in which human beings become, effectively, wedded to computers. “Cellphones inside our heads”, is how someone imagines the future. So there are two implications: for sick people with ALS whose lives can be made better, and perfectly healthy people whose lives can be made … what? Even better? Superhuman? Or less than human? Dangerously dependent for outsourced memory and cognitive capacity on computers which could go wrong?Well, Kennedy says these ideas are here to stay. He’s right. Father of the Cyborgs is in cinemas from 8 October"
Diana: The Musical review – a right royal debacle so bad you’ll hyperventilate,"This filmed version of the Broadway show, with its accidental comedy and cringeworthy lines, is a guilty-pleasures singalong in waiting",1,"And … now … it’s … springtime for glamour and victimhood, winter for Windsors and Charles. Netflix have now given us the filmed version of the entirely gobsmacking and jawdropping Broadway show Diana: The Musical, shot at the Longacre theatre on West 48th Street last summer with no audience while the show itself was on pause due to the Covid pandemic. And while you’re waiting for Pablo Larraín’s movie Spencer, starring Kristen Stewart as Diana, this will have to do. Although there is a danger it will cause you to hyperventilate.Not since the Cats movie have I literally shouted from my seat: “What? What? WHAT?” Only by having Diana ride on stage on the back of a Jellicle cat could this be more bizarre. If it was deliberate satire it would be genius, but it’s not. It’s a saucer-eyed retelling of the life of Diana, Princess of Wales, with bobbing chorus lines of footmen and flunkies who with a costume change morph into step-in-time phalanxes of snarling tabloid hacks, while Diana solemnly warbles downstage about her loneliness and determination in a pool of follow spotlight.The director is Christopher Ashley of the La Jolla Playhouse, and the (bizarre) book, music and lyrics are by Bon Jovi keyboardist David Bryan and Joe DiPietro, famed for the hit show Memphis. Diana is played by British-born musical theatre star Jeanna de Waal, who looks eerily like Tina Brown channelling Victoria Wood. Erin Davies is Camilla Parker Bowles; Roe Hartrampf is pompous Charles and Broadway veteran Judy Kaye has a double role as the Queen and also Diana’s step-grandmother, the chiffon-clad romantic novelist Barbara Cartland, the one character who does at least supply a bit of intentional comedy.Aside from Mel Brooks’s classic fictional stage creation about the Third Reich, the imaginary musical that this most resembles is the sub-Lloyd Webber extravaganza Elephant!, about the Elephant Man, in Richard Curtis’s comedy The Tall Guy, with its quirky chorus line of elephants and their perky trunks. It’s another study of terrible loneliness. We begin with single girl Diana bemused by Charles’s interest in her and confiding in her older sister Sarah, who has herself dated the Prince of Wales. She tells Diana that she would be a good match for Charles: “Against all odds, you’re still a virgin!”The lines of dialogue only get more deathless from there on in. Taken by the pompous and stuffy Charles to a cello recital by Mstislav Rostropovich, Diana sings: “The Russian plays on and on / Like an endless telethon / How I wish he were Elton John!” (“Telethon”? Really?) Charles and Diana begin their relationship to a background of press intrusion and royal sneering, while Charles keeps on seeing the worldly Camilla Parker Bowles. But soon Diana is pregnant with her first child, which results in Hartrampf’s Charles singing: “Darling, I’m holding our son / So let me say jolly well done!”My own personal nervous breakdown approached when Diana’s second child is born, and she sings the following lines into his cot: “Harry, my ginger-haired son / You’ll always be second to none!” And I succumbed to complete gibbering collapse when Charles erupts in rage at Diana’s on-stage dance routine with Wayne Sleep, demanding changes to her behaviour: “How about for a start / Don’t act like a TART … Diana!”Meanwhile, the common folk are drawn from something other than life. When Charles and Diana have to meet “people” from a place called “Wales”, these commoners are smudgy-faced, overgrown urchins. Later on, Diana meets some Aids patients, and they at least are shown far more respectfully. When Diana and Camilla icily confront each other, it is at a posh and stuffy fashionable party, with people sneerily singing: “Nights like this, I envy the poor / Their parties can’t possibly be such a bore.” Again, some intentional satire would be nice.This is a Rocky Horror Picture Show of cluelessness and misjudged Judy Garlandification. I can imagine masochists getting together for Diana: The Musical parties, just to sing the most nightmarish lines along with the cast. The rest of us will need a long lie down. Diana: The Musical is available on 1 October on Netflix."
Freakscene: The Story of Dinosaur Jr review – it’s all about the music,This warm-hearted profile of the US grunge-rockers doubles as a poignant rumination on friendship and personal growth – but gets its heft from the unpolished performance footage,4,"Delving into the legacy of US rockers Dinosaur Jr, this dynamic documentary beautifully balances the giddiness of a fan and the warmth of a close friend. Such deftness is perhaps due to the fact that director Philipp Virus is the brother-in-law of J Mascis, who, along with Lou Barlow and Murph, made up the band’s original lineup. It is a portrait of a groundbreaking period in American music that also doubles as a poignant rumination on friendship and personal growth.Formed in the mid-1980s, the original trio – two of whom were high-school friends – had a ragged wildness, straddling heavy metal and punk rock. Reserved and shy offstage, the three members were uncomfortable with the social side of the music business. Nevertheless, in spite of a slow start, Dinosaur Jr gradually moved from the underground to be more commercially viable, touring with the likes of Sonic Youth and Nirvana. With success, however, came creative compromises and internal conflicts, triggering the departure of Barlow and Murph.Amid such intense ups and downs, what makes Freakscene so engaging is its decision to put Dinosaur Jr’s music front and centre, with numerous audio and live performance excerpts. Interviews with the trio, and other artists such as Sonic Youth’s Kim Gordon, are shot in an unpolished style that mimics VHS rips of the band’s filmed gigs. The most moving movements are captured during a reunion concert celebrating Dinosaur Jr’s 30th anniversary; now older and mellower, the men have put aside their differences. All that matters is the music. Freakscene: The Story of Dinosaur Jr is released on 1 October in cinemas."
The Beatles and India review – the fab four go looking for a guru,"This engaging music doc recounts the time the band enjoyed a spiritual summer of love in Rishikesh, and briefly turned the whole world on to India",3,"The memory of the Beatles’ relationship with India is revived in this engaging documentary, and if there isn’t much really new here, it’s still salutary to be reminded of how these four young men – and it’s amazing to remember that they were only in their 20s, as Craig Brown’s book One Two Three Four points out – used their colossal influence, greater than any politician or movie star or religious leader, to direct the world’s attention to India, a country which until then had been opaque for many in the west.The film amusingly notes that, before this, India had been just as crazed with western Beatlemania as anyone else, with a popular Beatles-style band called the Savages, and Shammi Kapoor bopping around wearing a Beatles wig in Bhappi Sonie’s 1965 film Janwar.George Harrison visited India in 1966 to take sitar lessons from Ravi Shankar, and his humility and creative curiosity is still moving. In 1968, all four Beatles (Ringo Starr carrying a second suitcase full of tins of Heinz baked beans) went to the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi’s ashram in Rishikesh in the foothills of the Himalayas, where they earnestly pursued transcendental meditation, experienced a summer of spiritual love and wound up composing most of the songs on the White Album.The film rehearses the theory that with their manager Brian Epstein’s death in 1967, the Beatles needed a new guru, and duly fell for the Maharishi, whom they later found to be manipulative and grasping. Yet perhaps they reached this conclusion as a result of being manipulated by another guru, the supposed tech visionary Alexis “Magic Alex” Mardas, who became a malign influence on the chaotic business affairs of the Beatles’ Apple Corps.Maybe the Indian influence on the Beatles’ music didn’t last, but India’s own prestige, its soft power in the west, was immeasurably enhanced. The Beatles and India is released on 4 October on digital platforms."
Venom: Let There Be Carnage review – middling monster mush,Tom Hardy returns as the conflicted antihero in an admirably light-hearted but utterly disposable sequel,2,"The overextended world of big-screen superheroes has recently extended even further than previously thought possible with a desperate lurch into the realm of the multiverse, allowing for rules to be rewritten, characters to be resurrected and audiences’ pockets to be milked. It was introduced in 2018’s unusually smart Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse before being teased in the trailer for this December’s Spider-Man: No Way Home and it will probably be dogging the genre for years to come, appetite or no. The Venom franchise, which started in 2018 and continues with Let There Be Carnage, exists in an unofficial multiverse of its own: one that eradicates the elevated, overly self-serious worlds of Marvel and DC and continues directly on from the flip flashiness of the 90s Batman films and the slick straightforwardness of the 00s Spider-Man franchise.The first film was a surprisingly fun, if unsurprisingly disposable, throwback adventure that embraced its glaring Happy Meal tie-in goofiness and didn’t care for the overcomplicated world-building and portentous tone of more recent comic book fare. It was big and silly and anchored by an everything-thrown-at-the-wall performance from Tom Hardy as a journalist who has to live in the same body as a brain-eating alien, with space for thoughtful actors including Michelle Williams, Riz Ahmed, Jenny Slate and Melora Walters alongside. After it became a bigger hit than expected, gobbling up over $850m worldwide, a sequel was inevitably steered to the screen, with the original director, Ruben Fleischer, replaced by someone who knows all about duality: Andy Serkis. But while Serkis and the returning screenwriter Kelly Marcel have maintained the first film’s light zippiness (there’s none of that darker sequel nonsense here) and dated idea of cool (The Black Keys’ Howlin’ For You is an almost Xavier Dolan-level music choice in one scene), they’ve lost almost everything else, a pile of monster mush that should have been left in the lab.Hardy, to his credit, works hard for that big paycheck yet again, not required to show off quite as much manic physicality as before but committing himself to the stupidity of it all with full vigor. This time around, his reporter Eddie Brock (who in one scene appears to also be designing the front page of his newspaper, which is impressive) inadvertently transfers his alien-infused blood to a serial killer, Cletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson), who escapes execution with the help of his newly acquired tentacles. Calling himself Carnage, he vows to track down Brock and Venom and also his long-lost love, Frances, AKA Shriek (Naomie Harris), whose scream is able to kill those unlucky enough to hear it.It’s all far goofier than it sounds but while Marcel tries to up the ante from the last film in many ways, the mayhem wears thin far too soon. There’s a more pronounced lean into the humour of the Venom/Eddie dynamic but the film remains aggressively unfunny throughout, bar some decent sight gags, and so despite the alleged viciousness of Venom (who is desperate to eat brains but has to settle for M&Ms), it often feels like a film for kids who might find something dumb to laugh at among the gristle. There was an (unintentionally?) homoerotic undertone to the first film, amplified in a 2019 comic that had Spider-Man and Venom involved in a jokey scene of sexual flirtation, and Serkis has hinted at how there is a pronounced queerness to the sequel. Venom gets a “coming out” scene at a party that is “sort of an LGBTQIA kind of festival”, in his words, but on screen, it’s all predictably blurry and ultimately one of many scenes that hints at a more interesting, yet denied, take on the material. The PG-13 Venom movies take cues from R-rated body horror but pull back before things get really gnarly, a sort of frustrating tease of something as loose and wild as these films seem to think they are already.While Hardy emerges unscathed, he’s surrounded by actors who get precious little out of the film other than money towards a down payment on a new beach house. Harrelson tries to conjure up some of his Natural Born Killers malevolence but feels miscast for the role, acting younger to seem like he was at a reform school at the same time as his childhood sweetheart, played by the 15-years-younger Harris, who barely gets a look in. Williams understandably sleepwalks through the few scenes she has, much to the envy of us in the audience who are still awake, barely, for a finale that’s all sound and fury but no real fun.It’s at least a short film, clocking it at around 90 minutes, Serkis chopping off any extraneous fat, but it floats by and floats on without ever causing us to sit up and pay attention. Let there be no more.Venom: Let There Be Carnage is out in US cinemas on 1 October and in the UK on 15 October"
Even Mice Belong in Heaven review – stop-motion voyage to animal afterlife,"While it’s unusually candid about death, this Czech kids’ animation resorts to tedious quests and life lessons in lieu of a plot",3,"Movies aimed at very small children tend to be a bit squeamish about death. So this afterlife-for-kids animation gets points for recognising that thoughts about dying do rattle around in the four-year-old brain (along with unicorns, Hula Hoops and poo insults). The film begins with a show-offy young mouse called Whizzy being chased by timid fox Whitebelly; after a dazzling flash of headlights Whizzy and Whitebelly wake up in animal heaven. There’s a nice moment when Whizzy realises she’s dead. “That fox did get me,” she says with wonder.The animation – like Fantastic Mr Fox and Wallace and Gromit – is old-fashioned stop-motion puppetry (with a bit of assistance from CGI). It has that same deeply pleasing homemade aesthetic, as if you could reach in and touch every tuft of scruffy fur or knobbly twig.In heaven, traditional foes mouse and fox must put aside their earthly animosities. Up here, there is no pecking order: even big-ticket predators make friends with the food. The film’s Czech animators – it’s dubbed, somewhat unimaginatively, into English – give us some quirky, colourful characters and gorgeous detail. There’s a twinkly fairground and natural hot springs where newly deceased arrivals must wash.What’s missing is anything resembling a storyline. Instead, some tiresome antics ensue as mouse and fox embark on a series of meaningless quests. They must complete a scary ride at the fairground and make it across a forest – learning all the usual caring-and-sharing kids-movie lessons. It’s a shame that after that killer start, this wimps out of saying anything interesting about death or the adventure on the other side. Even Mice Belong in Heaven is released on 1 October in cinemas."
"Anne at 13,000ft review – a woman uses skydiving as therapy","Confident microbudget feature zones in on one woman’s unhappiness, and how skydiving provides an unlikely but dramatic release",3,"Deragh Campbell is an award-winning Canadian actor and film-maker whose recent movie MS Slavic 7 I have to confess to finding weirdly inert and indulgent. She has a starring role in this movie, which is a confident, intimate microbudget feature shot almost entirely in searching closeup, directed by Campbell’s longtime collaborator Kazik Radwanski. It is a more approachable piece of work and Campbell’s performance is unsettlingly real.She plays Anne, an unhappy young woman with a job in a children’s daycare centre and an undiagnosed anxiety disorder, whose life is turned upside down when she tastes the ecstatic thrill of skydiving. Anne gets on pretty badly with her grumpy, humourless colleagues – who may nevertheless have a point about her unprofessional, casual and derisive attitude – and argues with her mother. She meets a nice guy called Matt (Matt Johnson) at a co-worker’s wedding, though she may well be about to alienate him too. But all this is against the background of skydiving, which she took part in as part of the bachelorette party: the bride and all the maids-of-honour did it once, but Anne wants this amazing and passionate experience again and again. Could it be a miraculous therapy for her? Or is skydiving simply enlarging and intensifying her already troublesome and anarchic personality?Maybe Anne was already a skydiver in her heart, already a daredevil risk-taker and trouble-maker, and experiencing the wild freedom of skydiving has opened her eyes to how to stupid and tiresome and banal most of the people she meets on the ground actually are. Maybe skydiving was a glorious liberation or maybe it has messed up her life for ever. Either way she has effectively got skydiving instead of diagnosis and treatment for her psychological condition, and who knows if it isn’t just as effective? An intriguing and drily comic film. Anne at 13,000ft is available from 29 September on Mubi."
The Man Who Sold His Skin review – tattooed refugee story offers up art-world satire,Serious themes are undercut by the flippant tone of this story about a Syrian refugee who becomes a conceptual art object,2,"Here is a muddled caper of movie that doesn’t know what it wants to say; it doesn’t work as a satire of the international art market, nor as a commentary on the racism of white European culture. And its attitude to Syria is undermined by a silly and unconvincing ending that leaves a strange taste in the mouth. It is inspired by the Belgian conceptual artist Wim Delvoye and his human artwork called Tim: in 2008, Delvoye tattooed an elaborate punk-crucifixion scene on the back of a Zurich tattoo parlour owner named Tim Steiner, who in return for a cash payment agreed to sit still with his tattooed back on show in galleries for a certain number of times a year and have his tattooed skin surgically removed and put on display after his death. And of course it is this macabre destiny that lends fascination to the ongoing live events.This movie from writer-director Kaouther Ben Hania imagines a Syrian man, Sam Ali (Yahya Mahayni) in love with a well-born woman Abeer (Dea Liane). But when he is wrongfully arrested by the tyrannical Assad government, Abeer’s family pressures her into marrying a smooth diplomat, Ziad (Saad Lostan), who takes her to live with him in Brussels where he is an embassy attache. Sam Ali manages to escape from police custody (the least of the film’s implausibilities) and get over the border into Lebanon where, hungry and hard up, he gatecrashes art exhibitions and gobbles the free canapes. And this is where he is approached by a preeningly arrogant artist, Jeffrey Godefroi (Koen De Bouw), who looks like Roger De Bris, the theatre director in Mel Brooks’s The Producers. If Sam will agree to the humiliation of having a massive “Schengen visa” tattooed on his back, then Jeffrey will be legally able to transport him to Brussels as a conceptual art object rather than a human being, as part of a show about the commodification of humanity, and Sam will be able to see Abeer.This film is sort of asking us to giggle at the absurdity of the art scene, to frown at its callousness, but also at some level to celebrate its daringly transgressive social commentary; this does after all enjoy the blessing of Delvoye himself, who has an arch cameo. The supposedly important themes of immigrants and Syria are cancelled by its naive flippancy. Maybe the real-life artwork Tim is more interesting. The Man Who Sold His Skin is released on 24 September in cinemas."
The Man Who Sold His Skin review – scathing Tunisian satire,The art world and society’s attitudes towards refugees are equally skewered in this powerful Oscar nominee,3,"Oscar-nominated this year – the first Tunisian film ever to secure a nod – The Man Who Sold His Skin is a scalding satire on both the oblivious elitism of the art world and the value (or lack thereof) put on the lives of migrants. A refugee from Syria to Lebanon, Sam Ali (Yahya Mahayni) broods on the girlfriend he lost, who is now living in Belgium. The opportunity to travel there presents itself – but there’s a catch: he must allow an artist to tattoo his back, thus becoming a living work of art, available to be bought and sold.Provocative and challenging, if not the most subtle piece of political commentary, the film certainly cements Kaouther Ben Hania as a name to watch in Arab cinema."
The Tape review – Cornish-set folk musical bobs along like a floating flip-flop,A disillusioned musician stumbles upon inspiration in a charming film debut from folk singer Martha Tilston,3,"English folk singer Martha Tilston pulls off an impressive hat-trick of debuts as writer, director and star of this sweet-natured and gently charming Cornish-set romance. The script might be a little threadbare and some of the acting has a here’s-a-mate-I-roped-in-to-help quality. But it bobs along like a flip flop on waves of likability, with a genuinely warm and down-to-earth performance from Tilston. She plays folk singer Tally who is disillusioned with the music industry, living out of her campervan and working – in her own words – as “Cornwall’s worst cleaner”.What Tally really needs to respark her creativity is a room of her own (preferably with a sea view). She finally gets one by squatting in a house she’s been hired to clean – the elderly owner has recently died. Inside she finds a piano and a vintage four-track recorder, and begins making music again. When the old lady’s nephew Leo (Lee Hart) shows up, he’s so taken with Tally that he doesn’t let on he’s the new owner and instead rents a nearby fishing cottage. Leo is a corporate lawyer – though clearly not all bad, since he writes poetry and hates his job greasing the wheel of capitalism. (There really are a few too many shots of him standing in the sea, chinos rolled up, looking to the waves for answers to the meaning of life.)Of course, you know exactly where the movie is heading – and it’s not Tally signing up for a law conversion course and moving to London. She doesn’t think a relationship with Leo can work: “He’s a corporate lawyer, I’m chaos in wellies.” In truth, both characters feel a bit underwritten. They’re in their late 30s, but nothing is said about baggage from past relationships or what they think about having kids. Still, Tilston’s performance gives it a level of watchability and her modern folk songs about love and payday loans are brilliant. The Tape is released on 24 September in cinemas."
The Many Saints of Newark review – Sopranos prequel keeps it in the family,"Michael Gandolfini is goosebump-inducing as the young Tony Soprano, amid race riots and antagonism towards rival African American gangs",3,"Maybe it was inevitable that the greatest TV show in history should spawn a feature-length prequel that is somehow disappointing: it is watchable but weirdly obtuse with a tricksy narrative reveal that doesn’t add much. The Many Saints of Newark, co-written by the Sopranos’ legendary creator David Chase and directed by Alan Taylor, gives us the childhood of a leader: the teenage Tony Soprano, growing up in New Jersey in the 1960s, specifically the time of the 1967 Newark riots, which caused the “white flight” racism that explains the older Tony having that palatial home way out there in the suburbs that he drives up to in the opening credits each episode.Young Tony is portrayed with goosebump-inducing deja vu by Michael Gandolfini, son of the late James Gandolfini, who played the role on TV. Tony’s sleepy-eyed sensitivity, his melancholy, his glowering resentment and dangerous hurt feelings are there in embryo. His father, Johnny, is played by Jon Bernthal, and his terrifying mother Livia by Vera Farmiga who gives a superb rendering of Livia’s own haughty mannerisms. But you could spend this entire movie hanging on for the first sign of those all-important petit mal fainting fits that the TV show said originated in Tony’s dad. Is history being rewritten, or misrememberings corrected?The dramatic focus is now in fact with Tony’s honorary “uncle” Dickie Moltisanti (the name means “many saints”), played by Alessandro Nivola, who is the resident tough guy and Tony’s father figure while Johnny is away in prison, for an incident which Sopranos fans will remember from a flashback sequence in the show. Dickie is the father of Chris Moltisanti (Michael Imperioli) who narrates the movie from beyond the grave. Among these younger versions, Corey Stoll plays the grumpy, bald Corrado “Uncle Junior” Soprano, Billy Magnussen is Paulie “Walnuts” Gualtieri; John Magaro is Silvio Dante; Samson Moeakiola is “Big Pussy” Bonpensiero and Ray Liotta is brought in for a cameo as Chris Moltisanti’s grandfather, thus retaining the Soprano franchise’s connection with Scorsese’s Goodfellas. (Scorsese himself is reportedly unenthused by The Sopranos, perhaps nettled by the episode where he is played by an actor going into a club while Chris Moltisanti cheekily shouts that he liked Kundun – and Scorsese’s name actually remains misspelled in the credits for that TV episode.)This film shows the family’s growing antagonism to the African American gangs, led by Harold McBrayer (played by Leslie Odom Jr) and how their paranoia and xenophobia is made much worse by the riots, and by their suspicions that the Italian-American heyday in organised crime is coming to an end – but the film doesn’t quite get to grips with the racism theme. Impulsive Dickie Moltisanti uses these riots to cover up his most psychopathic slaying: a pleasingly noir moment, although he has a second crazed murder whose cover-up we aren’t allowed to discover.The Moltisanti angle is interesting, but frankly not as interesting as Tony’s parents themselves, particularly his mother. We hear about Livia’s psychological problems as well as Tony’s (Tony’s high-school career counsellor wittily echoing the role of a therapist) but Farmiga should surely have been far more important. There is a gloriously dysfunctional moment when, maddened beyond endurance by his wife, Johnny subjects her to a mock-execution in the car, firing his gun just by her ear. But Livia stays utterly unmoved, staring implacably even as her headscarf smokes and Johnny is reduced to muttering: “Don’t give me that look …” And meanwhile, the fateful career-choice of straight-A student Tony hangs in the balance.Of course, it could be that we will get a MCU-style spate of movies about these people and so the dramatic redundancies and partial frustrations won’t matter as much. There are many sinners here: for the next film, I want a starring role for Tony’s mother – the most terrifying Livia since I, Claudius. The Many Saints of Newark is released on 22 September in the UK, 1 October in the US and 4 November in Australia."
Picture Stories review – how one news magazine blew up British photography,"By chronicling day-to-day life in 1940s Britain, Picture Post became a visual media pioneer, as Rob West’s inspiring documentary reveals",4,"With photo-editing software and deepfakes continuing to steadily erode trust in visual media, it feels almost alien to hark back to a time of reverential interest and belief in photographs – when they held a totemic power to broaden worldviews and shape politics. With photospread succinctness, Rob West’s inspiring documentary about the British news magazine Picture Post, which was published between 1938 and 1957, lays out the case for its pioneeringly demotic photojournalism, high artistic credentials and impact on public policy.Picture Post was the brainchild of Hungarian émigré Stefan Lorant, whose editorship of German magazine Münchner Illustrierte Presse led to Hitler imprisoning him. He brought his antifascist, socialist sympathies with him to Britain – as well as a troupe of superb photographers, schooled by the European photojournalist tradition and able to frame these islands with an outsider’s eye. Selling nearly two million copies a week by the mid-40s, it featured itinerant jobseekers, sex workers, blitz firefighters and so on, socially conscious chronicling of day-to-day life that was also unafraid to make clear entreaties to those in power. After the war, the magazine canvassed readers about what kind of healthcare they would like to see.Threading through all this work was a unique photojournalistic sensibility that West – with the help of archival and new interviews with contributors, including Grace Robertson, who died this year – argues was hothoused at the Post, the sense of innate drama in incidental details of every frame drummed in by Lorant. It would have been interesting, though, to hear more about Lorant’s testy relationship with publisher Edward Hulton, and the underlying establishment allegiances that saw Lorant’s successor ousted after trying to expose UN abuse of Korean prisoners of war. Afterwards, the magazine declined into a bland, glamour-obsessed rag that foreshadowed modern celebrity publications. But it was already a touchstone for all forms of British photography – as a host of modern-day practitioners make clear in this chipper tribute. Picture Stories is available on digital platforms on 27 September."
Sacrilege review – an unholy desecration of women’s roles on screen,Debut writer-director David Creed falls prey to antiquated tropes in a stale folk-horror led by four vacuous final girls,1,"This eye-gougingly derivative folk-horror outing arrives as a form of hex on anyone trying to advance women’s representation on screen. Its four final girls, running around in hitched-up vests with slogans such as “no bad days” and “lucky clover”, are so vacuous, annoying and faux-empowered that Sacrilege almost unwittingly comes across as an 83-minute attempt to discredit the Bechdel test.“Here’s to the girls in stiletto shoes who make all the money and drink all the booze.” That’s the toast Kayla (Tamaryn Payne) and her pals Blake (Sian Abrahams) and Stacey (Naomi Willow) use to wash away bad news – that the evil mugger who beat Kayla into a coma is out on early release – and head off for a girls’ weekend to a remote country lodge. Even her cheating ex, the sulphurous Trish (Emily Wyatt), gets an invite. Once there, not only do they fail to clock the stag skull on their host’s Jeep grille, the one on the front door doesn’t ring any bells either.Clutching hot cuppas and batting around cringey chat (“I thought we weren’t supposed to mention Ilfracombe!”), the ensemble is painfully stilted. But the four actors are scuppered by debut writer-director David Creed’s hollow script – which is not only marked by lazy characterisation (the plaid-shirt-wearing, van-driving Blake is the “alternative” one) but has them jump through the hoops of his clunky premise. Targeted at a local festival by the goddess as the year’s lucky sacrifices, the girls start to experience hallucinations – induced by means unclear – of their ultimate fear. For influencer Stacey it’s ageing; for Blake it’s dogs; for us, another 20 minutes of sitting through this cattle-prodding obviousness.Fifteen years ago, Neil Marshall’s The Descent showed Brit-horror the smart route for female-led work. But showing plenty of tight torsos and cleavage, with nothing deeper to reveal, Creed fails to break away from more antique horror traditions. It doesn’t help that folk-horror, perhaps because it is so rooted in the ritualistic, is also becoming an increasingly ossified and crowded genre. The only sacrilege committed here is on the bank account of whoever funded this. Sacrilege is available on digital platforms on 27 September."
The Maltese Falcon review – dreamlike tension and the greatest MacGuffin of all time,"A dark, steely performance from Humphrey Bogart is at the cynical heart of John Huston’s adaptation of the classic detective novel",5,"John Huston’s adaptation of the Dashiell Hammett novel, as well as having the greatest MacGuffin of all time, is a ringing disproof of Raymond Chandler’s belief that detective stories depend on men coming through doors with guns. People arrive with guns a good deal in The Maltese Falcon, but mostly without them; Humphrey Bogart’s Sam Spade makes a point of telling us he prefers to be unarmed, and he has a very cool line in disarming other people. And what a superb performance from Bogart: darker, steelier and more ambiguous than his Rick in Casablanca, with all the world-weary cynicism, but none of the romantic sacrifice – just a strangely opaque manipulative streak, a need to use the women that cross his path. It’s a tough wised-up routine, involving pantomime displays of furious anger to intimidate people, which shifts to jaunty, unconcerned whistling when he is alone, and finally flowers into anguish and defiance.He plays San Francisco private detective Spade, who in time-honoured style is approached by a shady lady in his office: this is the highly-strung Brigid O’Shaughnessy, played by Mary Astor. She spins Spade a line about needing him to tail someone in the city. Spade isn’t buying it but allows his excitable partner Miles Archer (Jerome Cowan) to take the job, and Spade remains sociopathically unmoved at the news that Miles has been shot dead. By who? It just so happens that Sam has been carrying on an affair with Miles’s wife Iva (Gladys George) and this tough, cool customer is soon kissing Miss O’Shaughnessy full on the lips. From a shoal of red herrings emerges a slippery fellow called Joel Cairo, played by Peter Lorre, and heavy-set businessman Kasper Gutman, played by Sydney Greenstreet. They are all after the same thing: a staggeringly valuable jewelled ornament, the “Maltese Falcon”, once offered in tribute by the Knights Templar in the 16th century to the King of Spain.Perhaps it’s worth noting that the one woman whom Spade does seem to respect is his good-natured secretary Effie (Lee Patrick), whose loyalty may have been an inspiration for Miss Moneypenny, and Sam’s cruel detachment may have inspired the British secret agent she pined for. The scene in which Sam takes Joel’s gun off him and beats him up, all without removing the cigarette jammed into the corner of his mouth, is a comic triumph, topped off with Sam sportingly returning Joel’s gun to him and then bursting out laughing when Joel once again threatens him with it.The strange, dreamlike tension of the film escalates with each new confrontation, each new tailing, each new beating, with Gutman and Cairo shot from a queasy low angle, and the nightmare culminates in a gripping series of closeups on each strained face. Spade acidly dismisses the falcon as “the stuff that dreams are made of”, an anti-Prospero of cynicism and survival. The Maltese Falcon is released on 17 September in cinemas."
Mandibles review – bizarre giant-fly comedy runs out of sugar,"It’s a truly daft idea, but Quentin Dupieux’s film about a pair of robbers who try to train a giant insect doesn’t quite go the distance",3,"In the wild old days of the film festival circuit, directors, writers and hangers-on liked to end each day with drunken discussions about the movies they’d seen. They’d say what they’d liked and what they hadn’t, and the things they’d have done better if it was their story to tell. Occasionally, around the time the third bottle was brought out, they’d brainstorm daft ideas: the sort of idiotic, joke conceit that sounds great at 1am and less good the next morning when the hangover has kicked in. That culture is conspicuously absent from this year’s masked, distanced Venice. But incredibly, it appears that one of those wild notions has now fled the bar, taken shape and grown legs. And wings.Clocking in at a little over an hour, Mandibles is a rollicking, rambunctious tequila-dream of a movie, written and directed by Quentin Dupieux, whose superior Deerskin premiered at Cannes last year. It’s about Manu and Jean-Gab (Gregoire Ludig and David Marsais), two dopey deadbeats who steal a rustbucket Mercedes to run a mysterious - and surely illegal - errand up the coastline. On the way, they’re disturbed by a noise in the boot of the car. “Maybe it’s a hair-dryer,” Jean-Gab says hopefully.The thing in the boot is not a hair-dryer. It is, in fact, a giant fly with orange eyes the size of basketballs. This gives Jean-Gab an idea. It’s the sort of idea we’d most likely all have upon first throwing open the boot of the car. He wants to train the fly like a monkey and send it off to rob banks.At this stage of the event, the Venice audience is in need of a little light relief and it rose to embrace Mandibles as you might a long-lost college buddy (the one who always brought the best grass and a backstage pass for the gig). Manu and Jean-Gab are a pair of anti-heroes so stupid they can’t cook a simple meal without burning down the caravan, so one wonders how they’re ever going to train a giant fly to make them millionaires. Still, it’s fun to watch them careering around the scrubbier bits of southern France, hatching ludicrous plans and performing whip-lashing double-takes. They reminded me of Patrick Dewaere and Gerard Depardieu in Bertrand Blier’s Les Valseuses.The inherent peril of the drunken 1am idea for a movie, though, is that the wacky concept is pretty much the whole deal. Once you’ve opened the boot and marvelled at the contents, it’s hard to work out where a film goes from there, except round in circles, trying to find fresh gags in the material or more sugar to sustain it.In a big house in the hills, Manu and Jean-Gab meet Agnes. She’s played by Adèle Exarchopoulos, who was so good in Blue Is the Warmest Colour but has a rougher ride here. Agnes, we are told, has injured her brain in a skiing accident and Exarchopoulos plays her at top volume, screaming every line, taking offence at every turn; playing disability for belly-laughs as though she’s auditioning for Benny Hill. Barrelling into the master bedroom one morning, Agnes sees the bug and stops dead from the shock. But the girl has a screw loose, so who’s going to believe Agnes?It’s funny - the rogue elements that strain credibility and risk breaking a movie. Turns out I’m totally on board with a giant fly in the boot. It’s dumb, bellowing Agnes who finally blows out the film’s levels. Mandibles is released on 17 September in cinemas and on 20 September on digital platforms."
Schumacher review – a moving tribute to F1’s boy wonder,"Touching reflections from his family and home movie footage make for an intimate biography of the F1 star, if one that leaves his flaws unexamined",3,"‘I miss him every day, but Michael is here,” says Corinna Schumacher at the end of this Netflix documentary, blinking back tears as she talks about life with her husband since he suffered a devastating brain injury while skiing in 2013. That accident is awkwardly and glaringly unmentioned for most of this nearly two-hour film about his life, though of course you’re watching it all – the green-eyed boy wonder of Formula One, his successes, the rivalries and close shaves – in a brace position, waiting for the tragedy to come. Then, in the final 10 minutes, Corinna and the couple’s children, Gina and Mick (a F1 driver like his dad), speak about their loss.The film is a collaboration with the Schumachers and massively benefits from their archive of photos and home movies. The downside is that it has the blandness of authorised biography. Schumacher grew up around motor sport. As a kid, his dad Rolf managed a go-karting track; there’s a photo of little Michael aged four or five driving a pedal kart fitted with a moped engine. A who’s who of motor racing honchos politely walk through Schumacher’s career: Eddie Irvine, David Coulthard, Bernie Ecclestone, Mika Häkkinen and Damon Hill. But his aggressive streak and unsportsmanlike behaviour on the track remain unanalysed and underexplained. Unlike Asif Kapadia’s Senna, this doesn’t feel like a film for non-believers in Formula One; it helps if you really know your stuff and care about the sport.Schumacher, who hasn’t been seen in public since the accident, doesn’t appear – though we hear him in past recordings, speaking with that bullet focus of an athlete, which doesn’t allow for much in the way of self-reflection. He is most eloquent about the horrific crash that killed his rival Ayrton Senna at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix. The family, intensely private, don’t reveal the extent of his injuries, though Corinna talks about trying to make him comfortable, to “feel the bond of our family”. You feel desperately sad for her; in the pre-accident photos – one after another – you can see their unfakeable closeness as a couple: fingers intertwined, glowing with the happiness of people who know they’re luckier than most. Tragically, she says, he almost ditched the skiing trip: believing the snow wasn’t up to much, he wondered about sky diving in Dubai.Schumacher is on Netflix."
The Obscure Life of the Grand Duke of Corsica review – Tim Spall as oddball architect,"Spall plays an eccentric architect hired to design a tomb for the the eponymous aristocrat, in writer-director Daniel Graham’s homage to Peter Greenaway",3,"Having apprenticed in arthouse distribution, writer-director Daniel Graham has nobly devoted himself to reviving the aesthetics of once-prominent auteurs deemed unfashionable, uncommercial or both simultaneously. Graham’s 2017 film Opus Zero followed in the thematically dense, landscape-attentive footsteps of Theo Angelopoulos; this deeply eccentric follow-up tips a plumed hat to Peter Greenaway, casting Timothy Spall in what instantly resembles a post-Brexit update of 1987’s The Belly of an Architect. There’s a lot of vomit, and the film is something of a splurge itself, pebble-dashing the screen with ideas. Yet its better ones stick: whether new or regurgitated, the constituent elements are forever intriguing, even if Graham only partially pulls them together at the last.Spall is at his most Hogarthian, making a full three-course meal out of the contradictions of architect Alfred Rott, a sharp-suited vulgarian (and self-described “intractable arsehole”) dispatched to sunkissed Malta to oversee the construction of a new concert hall. Fired after his employers clock the building’s resemblance to female genitalia, Rott’s certainties are further tested upon encountering the eponymous figure, an ailing dandy (played by Peter Stormare at his most Stormarean) who wants him to design his final resting place.Graham, likewise, has much on his mind. This central narrative is interwoven with cutaways to 13th century monks and lepers, while a subplot concerning the Maltese authorities’ efforts to control a malaria outbreak suggests the script was being rewritten as the pandemic took hold.Graham, however, is vastly more restrained around matters of the flesh than his predecessor, replacing Greenaway’s visual opulence with a pared-back, still-striking elegance. What remains is a comparable playfulness: as in Opus Zero, a droll humour is a bulwark against accusations of pretension. A Pasolini-via-Python prologue sees an overhydrated monk tell St Francis that “I need to visit the shrub”; practically the final line is “Your money’s over there, underneath the dildo”. Most disarmingly, Rott becomes actively sympathetic, an index of Spall’s enduring ability to humanise cantankerous cranks. As with Greenaway, the inbuilt ripeness may repel some viewers, and certain themes go under-metabolised, but it’s reassuring to see someone still tossing out curveballs like this. The Obscure Life of the Grand Duke of Corsica is released on 17 September in cinemas."
The Paper Tigers review – martial arts team reunites in likable comedy,"Quoc Bao Tran’s tale of three ageing men who meet up again when their old teacher dies is formulaic but charming, with some great fight sequences",3,"Quoc Bao Tran, a promising film-maker whose previous work includes editing and action coordination, makes his writing-directing debut with this highly likable if formulaic action comedy about three middle-aged guys reunited when their old martial-arts master dies suddenly. The word on the internet is that Tran has been trying to get backing to make this for years, but the Hollywood studios he approached wanted him to whitewash it by casting at least one famous Caucasian actor. But Tran insisted on having the core trio played by two Asian Americans and one Black American and raised the budget partly through crowdfunding. The fact that none of the stars are huge names, and look just like schlubby dudes you might see on your street, makes this all the more accessible as a story about men who were once great athletes but have let their skills rust over a bit over the years.A montage of scratchy videotape footage with timecodes dating the material to the 1980s establishes the once-close friendship between ace fighter Danny, speccy scrapper Hing, and smooth talker Jim. The three of them are the only disciples of Sifu Cheung (Roger Yuan), a master of gung fu (not kung fu, the characters insist elsewhere), who trains the kids on paint-can equipment in his garage when he’s not working as a chef in a local Chinese restaurant. In the present day the Three Tigers, as they were known, have drifted apart. Danny (Alain Uy, soulful) works in insurance and is struggling to cope with being a part-time father to his young son. Hing (familiar character actor and film director Ron Yuan, delightful) has got a little stout. Only Jim (Mykel Shannon Jenkins) still works in sports, as coach at a local gym. Meeting up again at their sifu’s funeral, an associate from old days (Matthew Page, hilarious as a smug white guy dispensing fortune-cookie proverbs in Cantonese) suggests that maybe sifu didn’t die of a heart attack, and maybe he took on another disciple after they left.Tran adroitly layers the fight sequences, filmed with fluidity and at least substantially performed by the main actors themselves, between frothy layers of blokey banter. It’s not without its corny moments, especially the subplot concerning Danny’s relationship with his son and ex-wife, but that’s forgivable. The Paper Tigers is released on 20 September on digital platforms."
A Brixton Tale review – London girl-meets-boy drama questions the visual narrative ,"An interesting take on identity, as one half of a young couple videos the other, gets taken over by social commentary",3,"This London drama is directed with absolute confidence by first-timers Darragh Carey and Bertrand Desrochers, hitting the ground running with a girl-meets-boy story set in Brixton. It begins with a chaotic rush of teenage energy and hormones when white middle-class teenager Leah (Lily Newmark) gets together with Benji (Ola Orebiyi), who is black and from a low-income family. Before they meet, budding video artist Leah secretly follows Benji around Brixton, voyeuristically filming him handing out flyers for his mum’s nail bar and mucking about with his mates. Her footage gives us a portrait of Benji as an intriguing mix of charisma and shyness – with an innate kindness that makes the tragedy coming his way painful to watch.Together as a couple, Leah and Benji document their world: getting wasted at parties and playing video games. Leah’s aunt Tilda (nicely played by Jaime Winstone) runs a gallery for emerging artists and promises Leah a show of the material. But what Tilda wants is “authentic” footage, which means only Benji in front of the camera. The result is an edit that presents him as a stereotype: smoking spliff, hood up, giving the finger to the camera. There’s a brilliant moment on opening night when Benji looks around, and sees that the arty folk who fill the gallery are in their comfort zone perceiving him like this. As he says bitterly to Leah, she’s the one with the expensive computer and media connections. She’s in charge of the narrative.It’s here that A Brixton Tale starts to shuffle the deck of urban drama storylines. There’s a conflict with Leah’s ex that spirals out of control. When something awful happens it’s Leah, with her privilege and wealthy parents, who has all the levers at her disposal; her mistakes are fixable. It’s a film with some strong moments and impressive performances, especially from Orebiyi. But in the end it feels like social commentary overtakes the drama. A Brixton Tale is released on 17 September in cinemas."
Marceline. A Woman. A Century review – vibrant portrait of a fascinating film-maker,"Cordelia Dvorák’s intimate documentary about Marceline Loridan-Ivens – writer, director, and Holocaust survivor – captures her irresistible personality",4,"While still little-known outside France, the inimitable Marceline Loridan-Ivens was a formidable force of nature. A Holocaust survivor, her awe-inspiring resilience is deeply felt in her works as a writer and director. Finishing shooting mere weeks before her death in 2018 at the age of 90, Cordelia Dvorák’s intimate documentary is as vibrant as the signature auburn shade of Loridan-Ivens’ short, unruly hair.Loridan-Ivens’ harrowing experience as a teenager at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where she befriended Simone Veil, undoubtedly informed the ceaseless energy with which Loridan-Ivens embraced life and arts. In her brief period as an actor in Jean Rouch’s 1960s cinéma vérité films, she sparkles with a lively curiosity and an irresistible charm. Equally arresting is her romantic and creative partnership with her husband, leftist documentary film-maker Joris Ivens. At the height of the Vietnam war, at the invitation of Ho Chi Minh, the pair travelled to Vietnam and made the resolutely anti-imperialist 17th Parallel: Vietnam in War, which documented the devastating effects of American bombing.What makes this film so fully realised is a refusal to turn Loridan-Ivens into simply a feminist icon. Her vivacious and unusual personality shines brightly, and the camera even lingers on her appointment at a hair salon where she has her hair dyed. When asked by the stylist whether she would like to go blond for a change, Loridan-Ivens sticks with her signature red with the determination of a woman who has lived and understands herself well. It is this assured self-confidence that makes Loridan-Ivens such a fascinating subject to behold. Marceline is released on 17 September on True Story."
The Eyes of Tammy Faye review – Jessica Chastain nails gaudy TV evangelist,A compelling performance from the often miscast actor carries an otherwise by-the-numbers look at a Christian couple who spectacularly fell from grace,3,"Back in 2011, the sudden ubiquity of Jessica Chastain – from small-screen blink-and-misses to big-screen “oh her again” hits – meant that doors that had previously been closed were now opening, a relative embarrassment of riches for an actor breaking out in her 30s. While her three roles that year were all playing “the wife”, they still showed a promising versatility (an Oscar-nominated comedy wife in The Help, a thriller wife in Take Shelter and a Terrence Malick wife in The Tree of Life, the most challenging of all the wives) and thus, Chastain was thrust to the upper echelons of casting wishlists.The following year edged her even higher with another Oscar nomination (for Zero Dark Thirty) and over the next decade, Chastain confidently tried her hand at everything from schlock horror (Mama, It, Crimson Peak), earnest Oscar bait (The Zookeeper’s Wife, Molly’s Game, Miss Sloane), “elevated” multiplex fare (Interstellar, The Martian) and distinctly not elevated multiplex fare (The Huntsman: Winter’s War, X-Men: Dark Phoenix, Ava). There was something impressive about her jack-of-all-trades strategy but something less impressive about the work itself, never bad exactly but mostly lacking, a string of miscasts fogging our memory of her banner breakout year. Chastain, like Ryan Gosling, Charlize Theron and Brad Pitt before her, often feels like a character actor trapped in the body of an A-list lead, a freak flag waiting to be flown.That criminally untapped eccentricity comes rushing to the surface with the patchy biopic The Eyes of Tammy Faye, the story of “the Ken and Barbie of televangelists”, who rose to fame in the late 60s before sinking in disgrace in the 80s. Chastain is Tammy Faye, who moved away from a strict religious family to a marriage that took a more progressive view of Christianity, from God-fearing to God-loving. Her new husband, Jim Bakker (Andrew Garfield), introduced her to an exciting world of ambition and industry, monetising their faith as part of a growing new trend of preaching to the masses via the small screen. Tammy Faye’s austere mother (Cherry Jones) believed “there’s a limit to God’s love” but they disagreed and their sky’s-the-limit worldview took them to the top before scandal dragged them down.In the film, Jim is a familiar assemblage of red flags that Tammy Faye optimistically justifies and one of its smartest touches is only ever showing us the crumble of their world through her eyes (she’s in virtually every scene). But it’s one of the only interesting ideas that the Big Sick director, Michael Showalter, and Nurse Jackie writer Abe Sylvia have, the majority of the film plodding along like a by-the-numbers biopic, complete with lazy headline montages. Showalter is never sure whether to fully lean into the inherent campness of Tammy Faye and so the film is often too restrained, too polite, when telling the story of someone so rooted in excess. It’s a relief it doesn’t err too much on the other extreme (this isn’t an exercise in fun-poking punching down like, say, I, Tonya) but it’s still a little too lacking in personality, despite how much of it the protagonist exudes.Chastain has no such trouble modulating the gaudy with the grounded, fully committing to the outsized, extravagantly made-up ham of Tammy Faye while realising her genuine, well-intentioned earnestness (she tried to introduce liberalism, including an acceptance of queerness, into a world of bigotry). It’s a big, full-throated performance, a gamble that will probably prove divisive, and it’s easy to bristle at something so drastically transformative given how many actors have attempted similar fueled by thirst for an Oscar. But Chastain sells it as something more soulful than calculated mimicry, unravelling layers that Sylvia’s script doesn’t always provide her with. There’s a less convincing turn from a miscast Garfield, who never really settles comfortably into the role, made that much more glaring by Chastain’s fine work.The specifics of the Bakkers’ downfall, viewed from afar by Tammy Faye, involve fraud and the misuse of funds, something the film never really challenges her on. Jim was the clear architect but she was an increasingly involved accessory, happily living a luxurious materialistic life, and the film is a little too obsessed with lionising her to probe such murk. It makes some of the final-act downfall feel a bit simplified, a bigger, more complicated picture swapped out.After the formulaic fall-from-grace montage, we jump to the mid-90s as Tammy Faye sifts through the remaining pieces of her shattered life. It’s a moving, more meditative stretch that sees Chastain doing some of her best work, as Tammy Faye’s more affected tics fall away and the damage underneath become more visible. She sells it to the very end, consistently rising above what she’s been given and who she’s working alongside with such vigor that the prospect of her focusing on knottier, stranger characters in the future is one we should all be curious about. The Eyes of Tammy Faye’s focus might be all over the place, but our eyes remain trained directly on Chastain.The Eyes of Tammy Faye is screening at the Toronto film festival and will be released in cinemas on 17 September"
The Guilty review – Jake Gyllenhaal’s tense 911 call thriller,A glossy Netflix remake of the 2018 single-location Danish thriller about a kidnapped woman seeking help is a well-made piece of entertainment,3,"Here’s a tense single-location thriller directed by Antoine Fuqua, remade from Gustav Möller’s hugely admired Danish movie Den Skyldige (The Guilty) with a little more Hollywood gloss and based on the time-honoured premise of the 911 emergency operator taking a nail-biting call from a female kidnap victim who is pretending to her abductor that she is speaking to her infant daughter, and having to speak in code. (Brad Anderson’s 2013 film The Call – starring Halle Berry as the operator – had a comparable idea.)Joe Baylor, played by a gaunt Jake Gyllenhaal, is a troubled LAPD officer with a failed marriage and failing health; he has evidently got into serious trouble over some incident at work – and keeps getting calls from the press. Now, while his case is being investigated, Joe has been busted down to what he considers the humiliatingly lowly level of emergency operator with a headset phone, taking 911 calls from the public, the vast majority of these being farcically unimportant. Meanwhile, California wildfires are creating a continuous, ambient atmosphere of crisis.Then Joe is electrified to take the tearful call from a terrified woman, and whatever his own problems, his police savvy kicks in – he cleverly divines exactly what the situation is and how he can find out what’s happening from just a few clues. And the parallels with his own fraught family situation suggest to the agonised Joe that some kind of personal redemption is possible, and that Joe should make some desperate attempt to control and solve the entire situation from the phone. He becomes increasingly unprofessional and crazy – staying on the job after his shift ends and ignoring all the other 911 calls.Inevitably, it’s a stagey set-up, and the dramatic effect of the closeup on the officer’s sweaty face and the distant voice on the other end of the line begins to diminish over time, so Gyllenhaal has to lose it more extravagantly with shouting and temper-loss and confessional agony. But as time passes, it seems that the situation is more complicated that Joe thought – as is the question of who the title refers to.Perhaps to overcompensate for the lack of conventionally opened-out dramatic action, there is some big closeup acting from Gyllenhaal, but it’s a well-made and watchable picture of a man in the secular confessional box, a sinner forced to occupy the place of a priest.The Guilty is released on 24 September in cinemas, and on 1 October on Netflix."
Malignant review – lurid Argento-influenced horror is hit-and-miss,The Conjuring and Saw director James Wan’s latest is a curious combination of plodding thriller and spectacular body horror,3,"What’s scarier: bearing witness to a murder through the killer’s point of view or the victim’s? There’s no wrong answer, the point of the question being that the creepy complicity of spectatorship can be just as chilling as the terror of immediate danger. The first half of Malignant, James Wan’s latest bid at spawning another horror franchise of unholy profitability, enacts an exercise seemingly designed to test both sides of that equation. For hopeful mother Madison (Annabelle Wallis, a familiar face in the Wan-verse for her role in 2014’s Annabelle, no relation), the latest in a discouraging series of miscarriages has come with an unsettling side-effect. She’s been plagued by vivid dreams in which she stands by as a rangy-looking figure massacres strangers, visions which soon reveal themselves to be glimpses of actual events. Though our protagonist isn’t the one meeting her maker, she’s nonetheless disturbed by her unwilling part in the process, and we’re supposed to feel the same.For a goodly chunk of the film, that rudimentary game of perspective is the most compelling dimension of scenes that prove more interesting to think about than watch. That all changes around the midway point, as the script shifts gears into an agreeable register of B-movie lunacy, but it takes too much of the nearly two-hour run time to get there. Wan and screenwriter Akela Cooper have a sturdy, memorable hook on their hands, good enough to be left unspoken here – let’s just say that medical oddities have proven a reliable source of bizarre grotesquerie for many before them. If only they’d put fuller faith in the true nature of their premise, and leaned all the way into the kookier side of body horror. Instead of trying for the sophistication of Cronenberg and coming up short, they’d be better off embracing the near-absurdity of lower-rent cult objects like Basket Case from the start. Like one of its key characters, this movie only comes alive when it mutates into the thing it’s been concealing.A prologue sets the heightened tone that Wan then puts on hold for about an hour, starting with an exterior establishing shot of a Gothic-designed mental institute unafraid to look like an old-school miniature model. There, a patient’s escape coincides with all hell breaking loose stylistically; canted camera angles keep us off balance, splashes of crimson embellish the frame, and actors read their lines with the theatrical exaggeration endemic to late-night Elvira selections. It’s good fun, and as the somewhat more grounded scenes to follow illustrate, it’s the only way to make Wan and Cooper’s gummy dialogue work. Madison and those in her orbit speak with a dull sense of bald purpose, their words hustling the plot along without conveying much in the way of character. “I’m her sister,” is how Sydney (Maddie Hasson) announces herself, and though her bond with Madison solidifies into the film’s load-bearing emotional column, their closeness is generally stated rather than shown.Sydney and the detectives (George Young and Michole Briana White) working her sibling’s case follow the string of corpses right back to Madison, whose claim that her girlhood imaginary friend Gabriel the Devil did it doesn’t hold water with the cops. Up to this point, Wan’s just reconfiguring his filmography’s favored narrative devices – Saw’s patient madman taking revenge years in the making, the hysterical possessions of Insidious and the Conjuring – without too much fresh innovation. A handful of set pieces toy with space using flashing light bulbs to underwhelming effect, but it’s only once Madison’s getting the snot kicked out of her in a jail cell by the great stuntwoman Zoe Bell that all hell starts to break loose. The lurid aesthetic returns in full force, the blocking grows frantic and restlessly mobile, even the writing sharpens up. Following a massacre of local police, a woman calling 911 takes a beat and realizes the people she’d be calling are already dead all around her.In an interview with IGN, Wan expressed a desire to work at a more intimate scale between blockbuster studio gigs, something in line with “the kind of films that excited me when I was much younger, when I was a teen growing up, idolizing film-makers like De Palma, Argento, and all that”. Those influences, De Palma’s twisted Sisters in particular, make themselves known in this winningly demented second-act stretch up to the acrobatic finale. (The Argento name-check boils down to the copious closeups of black-gloved hands wielding a medical award modified to serve as a dagger, a splendid and original signature weapon.) Maybe there’s something to be said for the surprise factor of such a sudden, palpable change in the film’s atmosphere. In practice, however, it feels like Wan’s being stingy with the livelier mayhem he’s evidently capable of unleashing. He can access a spectacular cinematic evil lying dormant inside him, so he ought to take a cue from his own story and let it be free before it can eat through the back of his skull.Malignant is out in US and UK cinemas and available on HBO Max"
Encounter review – Riz Ahmed can’t save uneven sci-fi invasion drama,A strong central performance isn’t enough to sell a disappointingly plotted follow-up to British director Michael Pearce’s thrilling breakout Beast,2,"Michael Pearce is the British director who made a terrific feature debut at Toronto in 2017 with his psychological drama-thriller Beast, but I have to admit I was disappointed with his new film, a starrier, bigger-budget studio picture.Through a certain kind of narrative sleight-of-hand, Encounter first leads you into an intriguingly tense and gritty sci-fi, that title being a sneaky and none-too-subtle nudge. But then, after conceding some what’s-wrong-with-this-picture strangeness, the movie downshifts to something else, something more commonplace, but the shift itself feels anticlimactic and frustrating, considering the way we had all in good faith bought into the initial premise with all its specific jeopardy and suspense. And the procedural elements don’t feel all that convincing. But there’s certainly a fervent lead performance from Riz Ahmed, playing Marine Corps veteran Malik Kahn.Maybe nothing in the movie can live up to the inspired, wordless opening sequence: the arrival of an interplanetary invasion, or some kind of meteor shower: weird organic matter that lands silently, unnoticed, disgorging tiny malign spores. In closeup, we see what appears to be a bug landing softly on human flesh and then we descend to the inner-body level, the microscopic creature swimming through the bloodstream, feasting on what it invisibly finds.Then we see Malik (Ahmed), a tough but troubled guy with military experience and access to military intelligence. Malik is galvanised by the top-secret material he has discovered – the truth about this alien bug invasion, which to his rage the US government has covered up. The insects have now infected as much as half the population; these people are mostly asymptomatic but it is only a matter of time before there is an outbreak of horror. Malik has no choice but to rescue his two young sons Jay (Lucian-River Chauhan) and Bobby (Aditya Geddada) from his ex-wife and her new husband before it is too late. But this means a reckoning with Malik’s government handler, Hattie – a strange and unconvincingly written role with which Octavia Spencer does her best.It’s conceivable that a director like M Night Shyamalan would have played this idea differently, holding on more specifically to Malik’s own viewpoint, his loneliness and his family-man idealism, although in some ways it’s a relief that Pearce and his co-writer Joe Barton tip their hand when they do. But the trompe-l’oeil effect is a difficult hump to get over and what’s on the other side of it is not as interesting as the world which the movie had been born into.There are certainly some strong scenes between Malik and his boys, and an edge-of-the-seat moment when Malik is pulled over by a traffic cop on a deserted stretch of highway at three in the morning. That is a tremendously written and tautly directed scene, with a pleasingly creepy aftermath. But the real-world consequences are not really worked into what comes afterwards, and Hattie’s relationship with the cops and federal officers is a little fanciful. It all adds up to less than we hoped, though Pearce’s direction is never less than confident.Encounter screened at the Toronto film festival and is released on 3 December in UK cinemas and on 10 December on Amazon Prime Video."
The Wonderful: Stories from the Space Station review – awe generators turned up to 11,The multi-national International Space Station gets its story told through the men and women who worked on it,3,"With such strong base-level material, you could hardly go wrong, and so it proves with this history of the International Space Station, which has been orbiting the Earth 250 miles up since 1998. This is very much the authorised version, told largely through interviews with a select multi-national group of the over 200 astronauts who have spent time on it. With copious footage of rockets blasting off, the ISS streaking along above the atmosphere, and many God-shots of Earth itself, this has the awe-generators turned up to 11.The interviewees are of perhaps slightly less dramatically impressive character, despite their undoubted achievements – possessing a workable sense of humour doesn’t seem to be high on astronaut qualification lists. They are not especially well-served by the film-makers’ embellishments, with over-produced childhood-memory sequences, distracting musical choices on the soundtrack, and bland segment-introduction quotes. Still, they are empathetic enough, especially when the accent is on their personal and family experiences: standout, surely, is Cady Coleman, who went to the ISS in 2010, and her glass-blower husband Josh Simpson, who both speak movingly of the crisis of separation.Major news events also intrude into this self-contained world: footage from space of the smoke cloud rising from New York on 9/11, and the loss of the Columbia shuttle in 2003 are jolts to the serene cosmic mood. Perhaps less well-known is John F Kennedy’s determination – as evidenced in a UN speech and a written memo to Nasa – to get the USSR involved in America’s space-flight ambitions; it’s in this spirit of international co-operation that the ISS was evidently conceived. This film is a capable, wholesome tribute to a project that is about as warm and fuzzy as space travel gets. The Wonderful: Stories from the Space Station is released on 13 September on digital platforms. This article was amended on 29 November 2021 to give Cady Coleman’s ISS arrival date as 2010, not 1995."
"Love, Rosie: timing is everything in this delectable Lily Collins romcom","Sweet without being saccharine, this 2014 gem juggles the dreams of carefree youth and the fallout from when life’s best-laid plans go awry",0," Love, Rosie is streaming in Australia on Netflix. For more recommendations of what to stream in Australia, click hereAdapted from Cecelia Ahern’s 2004 bestselling novel Where Rainbows End, the 2014 romantic comedy Love, Rosie follows childhood best friends Rosie (Lily Collins) and Alex (Sam Claflin) as they dance around their feelings for each other for more than a decade. Having grown up forging an unbreakable bond built on trust, shared dreams and a deep understanding and appreciation of each other’s peccadillos, the friends together agree to leave their dull, suburban English lives behind for the bright lights and possibilities that Boston has to offer. For Rosie, it’s to pursue hotel management in a quest to own her own hotel one day. For Alex, it’s a Harvard scholarship to study medicine.Right away it’s fairly obvious that one’s passion for hotel management doesn’t really necessitate upending one’s entire life. But that’s just the first of many indicators that there might be more bubbling away under this supposedly platonic relationship between Rosie and Alex.Their chemistry is evident from one of the opening scenes, in which they share a drunken kiss at Rosie’s 18th birthday, the moment threatening to expose their emerging feelings for one another. Under the haze of an epic hangover the following day, Rosie recalls the night in horror, wanting to wish it all away – only she’s talking about needing to get her stomach pumped, not the whole pashing her best friend part, which she has forgotten ever happened. Alex takes her brutal rebuff to heart and, assuming Rosie wishes to forget the potential evolution of their relationship, retaliates by hooking up with school bombshell, Bethany (Suki Waterhouse).Simmering with unexpected jealousy, Rosie accepts an invitation to the school dance from “the fittest guy in school”, Greg (Christian Cooke), leading to an unsatisfying sexual encounter and unfortunate mishap that changes the trajectory of Rosie’s life. For the first time in their lives, their paths completely diverge and Rosie and Alex fumble through the ensuing years via video messages, late-night texts and emails all at the whim of an international time difference, ill-timed visits and missed opportunities – sometimes at the hands of others. From goofy and excitable dreamers to young adults reasonably self-assured but still wracked with self-doubt, Love, Rosie makes its couple work harder than most to get their happy ending.In a narrative spanning 12 years, Collins and Claflin manage to believably bridge the transition from teen to 30-something, bringing nuanced performances that go beyond their changing hairstyles to signify the passing of time. While Collins recently gained notoriety and some derision for her star turn in Darren Star’s light and frothy Netflix offering Emily in Paris, there’s depth to this actor: she proved her dramatic chops in a supporting role alongside Gary Oldman in last year’s Oscar-nominated Mank, and draws on some of that gravity here.Collins and Claflin juggle the juxtaposition between carefree youth and life’s best-laid plans being thrown akimbo thanks largely to a sparkling and well-paced screenplay by Juliette Towhidi (Calendar Girls). At times it dips into the slightly bawdy, but it also creates moments of touching pathos among the litany of missed chances and miscommunications that the genre mandates.A welcome addition to the cast is Jaime Winstone as the forthright and endearing Ruby. It’s a role that could have easily been reduced to sassy sidekick, but her often-brutal honesty acts as the perfect foil to the earnest Rosie, whose rose-coloured glasses become increasingly clear as her life’s plans veer off course.There are a couple of jarring transitions between scenes, and some of the music cues are a little heavy-handed. But aided by a perfectly 2000s pop soundtrack, the gentle direction of Christian Ditter and the dynamics of the core relationship keep the story’s sincerity in sharp focus. Love, Rosie is sweet without being saccharine, thanks largely to the perfectly pitched Britishisms, placing it squarely alongside the likes of Notting Hill or Bridget Jones’s Diary. At its heart is the achingly poignant truth that timing is everything."
Sweet Thing review – drama of struggling children is a low-key delight,"Alexandre Rockwell’s semi-improvised film, which stars his wife and children, is imperfectly plotted but brilliantly acted",4,"Here is a drama about kids trying to escape abusive environments, shot mostly in black and white, written and directed by Alexandre Rockwell, who was once going to be the next big thing after early hit In the Soup and contributing a quarter to portmanteau work Four Rooms. But he struggled to get his subsequent films airborne: none were big, or even medium-sized, hits. Tiny and intimate, Sweet Thing isn’t likely to do boffo box-office either, but this small, delicate, late-blooming film is quite lovely, and a throwback to the 1990s/2000s craze for semi-improvised, rough and ready indie film-making.Like George Washington from 2000 or 2012’s Beasts of the Southern Wild, much of its success rests on the narrow shoulders of its young leads, who happen to be played by Rockwell’s own children. (They also starred in the director’s Little Feet a few years ago.) Indeed, this is very much a family affair: the kids’ real mother, Karyn Parsons, also plays their mother, although creating in the process a character hopefully very unlike her own. As the story starts, 14- or 15-year-old Billie (Lana Rockwell) and her little brother Nico (Nico Rockwell) are living with their dad, sometime sidewalk Santa but mostly unemployed Adam (Will Patton) – a man so soaked in booze that, with one spark, he’d go up like a discarded Christmas tree. When he finally gets sent to rehab, the kids are billeted with Eve, their mother, and her sleazy boyfriend Beaux (ML Josepher). But the latter turns out to be both physically and sexually abusive, and the kids run off with Malik (Jabari Watkins) a similarly down-on-his-luck teen from the neighbourhood.The last act falls back on hoary old plotting cliches, even going so far as to include a Chekhovian pistol. But the easy, spontaneous banter back and forth between the kids is charming, and all three actors hold the camera like they were born to act. If you had to pick a standout, it’s probably Lana Rockwell, who not only has a mesmerising stillness and the expressive features of a Renaissance Madonna, but is also gifted with a lustrous singing voice, shown off several times via her haunting a cappella rendition of Van Morrison’s Sweet Thing – turned here into a piercing reclamation of innocence. Sweet Thing is released on 10 September in cinemas and on digital platforms."
Copilot review – 9/11 terrorist fantasy backstory is flawed and naive,"Ziad Jarrah, the hijacker-pilot on the United 93 flight, is reinvented as a considerate husband in Anne Zohra Berrached’s film",2,"Anne Zohra Berrached’s film is ambitious and interestingly intended, but naive and flawed, with a fundamental problem, which is right up there in the title. It presents us with a romantically imagined fictional couple inspired by Ziad Jarrah, the Lebanese-born 9/11 hijacker-pilot on the United 93 flight and his one-time German-Turkish partner Aysel Şengün, whom he had met while a student drawn into al-Qaida’s notorious Hamburg Cell. Jarrah is often regarded as different from the other hijackers in that he came from a wealthy family, was not averse to the western world of pleasure, and was even rumoured to have had (temporary) qualms about the mission itself. Jarrah was dramatised as a rich-kid jihadi convert in Antonia Bird’s TV drama The Hamburg Cell in 2004, and made an appearance in Paul Greengrass’s real-time thriller United 93, two years later.Jarrah is fictionalised here as Saeed (Roger Azar), a smart, idealistic Lebanese student and would-be pilot in Germany who falls for Turkish medical student Asli (Canan Kir); they marry but the relationship sours as he becomes more controlling, secretive and fanatical. His cousin’s plan to open a restaurant with a bank loan triggers an ugly, antisemitic tirade against “Zionists” and “moneylenders”. He heads off for an unexplained trip to Yemen but returns, apparently contrite, with scars and an apparent determination to have no more to do with these people – but then there is talk from the newly relaxed and smiley Saeed of going to flight school in Miami, Florida.Copilot is well acted with some good scenes; including a fascinating account of Asli going to Beirut on her own to meet his family, hoping that Saeed will have gone to Beirut as well – only to find that he is not there and she is expected to tell her distraught in-laws where on earth her husband is. This romantic and considerate Saeed repeatedly calls Asli his “co-pilot”. When Asli goes out to Florida to visit he takes her up in a small aircraft and even lets her briefly take the controls. It is a lenient, evasive and obtuse vision: 9/11 jihadi fanatics did not think of women as “co-pilots”. They already had co-pilots – other terrorist men. Women were second-class citizens, irrelevant temptations and distractions compared with the macho martyrdom ahead. Copilot avoids this simple fact and does not really engage with Saeed’s purported second thoughts, or his apparent third thoughts re-committing to the hijack, or with the enigma of Asli’s failure to understand what is going on in his head. It’s a backstory fantasy which does not really come off. Copilot is released on 10 September in cinemas. This article was amended on 21 September to correct a suggestion that the real life characters on which the film is based were not married, and that Ziad Jarrah did not take Aysel Şengün on a small-plane flight in Miami."
From the Vine review – laugh-free comedy of midlife Italian escape,Joe Pantoliano stars as a disaffected executive setting out to revive his grandfather’s vineyard in this tiresomely whimsical tale,1,"An Italian-American man in late middle age rejects the rat race and embarks on a voyage of self-discovery and winemaking in this lifelessly unfunny comedy. It’s Eat Pray Love for wealthy male boomers: embarrassingly sincere and iffily patronising to its Italian characters. The star is veteran character actor Joe Pantoliano, who played toupeed scumbag Ralph Cifaretto in The Sopranos – he looks deeply uncomfortable here as Marco Gentile, a nice-guy car industry CEO. For most of the movie Pantoliano keeps his mouth fixed in what is meant to be, I think, a warm, welcoming smile. But maybe it’s the Sopranos baggage: his grin looks to have a slight edge of hostility, like a shark flashing its teeth.At the beginning of the movie Marco impulsively quits his job, taking the moral high ground on an ethical issue with his Canadian company’s board. He books a ticket to Italy, where he left aged six for a better life in the US – though, of course, the lesson coming his way is that what a better life actually entails is the simple pleasure of sitting under a tree peeling an orange with a penknife while wearing a handkerchief as a makeshift hat.Marco’s wife and adult daughter tell him it’s a midlife crisis when he announces he’s taking up winemaking on the estate he inherited from his grandfather – it’s been shuttered for years. The old boy even appears beseechingly in his dreams: “Marco, this land is part of you.” Elsewhere the rustic locals speak to him in adorable broken English. Prince Charles famously chats to his plants; well, they talk back in this movie – in one of the whimsical touches that is supposed to be quirkily charming.In The Sopranos, Ralphie wound up with his head in a bowling bag minus the toupee. That now looks like a merciful fate by comparison. From the Vine is released on 10 September in cinemas."
Il Buco review – unhurried meditation on the beauties of geological time,"Ten years after village doc Le Quattro Volte, Michelangelo Frammartino returns with an observational piece centring on a deep-cave system in Calabria",4,"In 2011 Italian artist Michelangelo Frammartino scored a small indie hit with a film called Le Quattro Volte, a metaphysical study of a mountain village that featured bleating goats and ringing bells, charcoal burners and Roman centurions. Le Quattro Volte was odd and gentle and by and large people loved it. I’m not sure how much money one earns from a small indie hit. Probably enough to pay for a weekend break in Tropea. Now Frammartino is back – 10 years later, not wanting to rush things – with the lovely Il Buco, another film that is content to saunter on the wild side, gazing at woods and sky, rocks and trees and identifying a serene, quiet heaven in everything that it sees. It’s not quite a documentary, yet nor is it exactly a narrative feature. It lives alone; the cinematic equivalent of a hermit on a mountaintop.Frammartino’s last film was inspired by Pythagoras. This one takes its prompt from a 1961 potholing expedition in Calabria, mapping out a labyrinthine cave system which was confirmed at the time as the third deepest in the world. The film shows the cavers descending its slick twists and turns and uncovering an old photo and a damp magazine with JFK on the cover. Whatever item slips into the crevasse instantly becomes history, or a lost memory; a teasing remnant of the people who once walked above.Il Buco, in its meditative, unhurried fashion, tells the story of the speleologists’ mission. But it links this with the fading fortunes of an ancient peasant farmer who lives in a shack near the hole. Frammartino shows the man sitting patiently on the mountainside, summoning his cattle as though speaking in tongues; and then again, later, ailing in bed while his middle-aged son maintains an anxious watch. Il Buco, in essence, contrasts the deep time of the cave with the shallow time of those who live around it. The weatherbeaten farmer is 80 years old if he’s a day. But in geological terms that registers as an eyeblink.Amid all the noise and fury of this year’s Venice film festival it was a pure pleasure to sit for a spell with Il Buco, to watch the old farmer, the young cavers and to listen to the sound of the wind in the trees. I’m not certain that I can fully explain it. I’m not convinced that it matters. Frammartino goes about his business in the manner of a discreet anthropologist: rarely interfering, content to simply set up his camera and watch the people and livestock go by, as though the very act of observing is itself a great privilege. Which it quite possibly is. It made me think of the brief piece of archive footage that opens the film: the tale of a New York window-cleaner who boasts that he loves his work because it gives him the chance to look through the glass of the office buildings and see all the people hard at work - either not knowing or not caring that he’s actually working as well. Il Buco screens at the Venice film festival."
Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings review – a superhero movie that justifies the hype,Marvel’s latest blockbuster is an electrifying fusion of convincing characters and breathtaking CGI,4,"Although it often feels as though barely a month passes without another comic book movie puffed as a new pinnacle of achievement for the superhero genre, it’s vanishingly rare for a film to actually deserve its hype. But Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings does so, and more. Director Destin Daniel Cretton, who co-wrote with Dave Callaham and Andrew Lanham, is canny enough to realise that the key to success with an effects-driven, eye-popping extravaganza is not the CGI spectacle, it’s the basic stuff. Textured characters. Karaoke and shots-fuelled friendships. And electrifyingly badass fight choreography.In the goofy exchanges between Simu Liu’s Shaun (heir to his father’s tricky relationship with power, and his mother’s fierce empathy) and his best friend, defender, drinking buddy and fellow valet car-parker Katy (Awkwafina), the film is already one of the freshest Marvel pictures in a long time. And that’s before the fight on a runaway bus featuring an eastern European man mountain with a laser arm prosthesis.But perhaps what’s more telling than where this film fits within the Marvel universe (it’s an outlier, and all the better for it) is how elegantly it slots into the wuxia fantasy-infused Chinese martial arts tradition. Both in casting (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon’s Michelle Yeoh, as serene and deadly as ever, and Hero’s Tony Leung take key roles) and in set pieces (there’s a nod to the iconic bamboo forest sequence in House of Flying Daggers), the film takes its cues from the martial arts epics of the early 2000s. Paying homage without becoming derivative is a difficult balance, but the film succeeds.Likewise, Cretton negotiates potential cliches such as flashback sequences and that hoariest of old chestnuts, the training montage, with a gravity-defying lightness of touch. It’s only at the very end, when the picture trades its focus on exquisite, thrillingly executed fight sequences for a battle between a bunch of special effects, that this exhilarating blend of genres loses a bit of its shine."
Anthropocene: The Human Epoch review – colossal eco doc prettifies disaster,"The visuals are impressive but, without giving them the necessary context, this ‘cinematic meditation’ on humanity’s environmental impact only serves to aestheticise destruction",1,"Co-directed by Jennifer Baichwal, Nicholas de Pencier and Edward Burtynsky, here is an undeniably colossal filmmaking effort, shot across 22 countries. It purports to be a “cinematic meditation” on the havoc humans have wreaked on the environment, yet the style-over-substance approach reduces these eco-conscious contemplations to a mere exercise in aesthetics, without any social or political context.A proposed geological epoch, the concept of the Anthropocene suggests that we are now in the age in which human activities have had a significant impact on the planet’s ecosystems. In short, the face of the Earth is literally changing due to humanity’s impact. Throughout the film, the camera glides over shocking sights of environmental destruction, from barren farmlands to deforestation. The grandeur of the drone camerawork, however, becomes distinctly uncomfortable: this film is more interested in showing ruins than probing their causes or solutions. A particularly vile sequence orgasmically sets a day of marble quarrying in Carrara in Italy to Mozart’s Don Giovanni. The activity is environmentally troubling, yet the film seems unable to not revel in its empty beauty.Furthermore, the ASMR-esque narration by Alicia Vikander constantly pits “the Earth” and “the humans” against one another, as if environmental destruction is an equal-opportunity act for all mankind. Lumping individuals and conglomerates under one collective “human” umbrella does little to shed light on the climate crisis. At one point, in suggesting how “humans” have altered Earth’s surfaces, the film cuts from Kenyan people dumpster-diving in a humongous trash site to the christening of a tunnel in Switzerland, as if these events are somehow equivalent. (Let’s not forget that rich countries have been exporting their waste to poorer nations for years.) The film, however, is sure to enjoy a long shelf-life in school classrooms. Anthropocene: The Human Epoch is released on 3 September in cinemas."
 Venice film festival 2021 week one roundup – serious firepower,"With big-hitters from returning heroes Jane Campion, Pedro Almodóvar and Paolo Sorrentino, plus an electrifying return from maverick Paul Schrader, it’s a heck of a starting bill at the Lido",0,"This time last year, the film world raised a collective glass of prosecco to Venice. It was the first film festival to happen during that brief, sweet interlude between European lockdowns, and the organisation pulled off the Covid protocols magnificently – spaced seating, strict mask wearing, online ticketing. All that is still in place, and the gardens of the Casino compound remain a leafy oasis of calm.But this year things aren’t quite so simple. For a start there are many more people attending, and the booking system has been unpredictable. Tickets for each screening become available exactly 74 hours in advance, some selling out within minutes, which means people are waking to book tickets at 6.30am, then spending the day anxiously trying to think ahead in three-day cycles. Add to this frustratingly long queues to get into the Casino area via temperature checks and bag checks, and only two days in – at time of writing – nerves are beginning to fray.Let’s hope that things settle down in the next few days, because this festival has all it takes to be at least the equal of 2020’s corking edition. It has a blockbuster lineup, its first few days front-stacked with hot auteur names. The most awaited was probably Jane Campion’s first feature since 2009’s Bright Star. Based on Thomas Savage’s novel, The Power of the Dog is a neo-western set in the 1920s on a Montana ranch run by two brothers. Phil (Benedict Cumberbatch) is an Ivy League-educated alpha male who prides himself on living by rough-and-ready cowboy codes, Jesse Plemons’s George a downtrodden decent soul. When the latter marries a local widow (Kirsten Dunst), who comes to live on the ranch with her son, a sensitive medical student (Kodi Smit-McPhee), Phil’s darker motivations come sharply into play.The film is Campion’s most direct statement yet about the bleaker aspects of traditional masculinity, with Phil revealing layer on layer of troubled psyche, Cumberbatch’s body language memorably eloquent throughout, even when (or especially when) cloaked in the dust-steeped shadows of Ari Wegner’s magnificent photography. It’s perhaps a little too much played on a sustained muted note, but it’s a work of real magnificence and ambition, with a characteristically superb Jonny Greenwood score.Pedro Almodóvar returned to Venice with the opening film, a year after wowing the festival with his short The Human Voice. He has recently given us a couple of autumnal-stage masterpieces, Julieta and Pain and Glory, so it’s his prerogative to coast a little. His new drama, Parallel Mothers, is involving but feels oddly unfinished. Penélope Cruz plays a photographer who has a baby in the same maternity ward as a nervous teenager (name-to-watch Milena Smit). Their fates are henceforth linked, in a way that feels at once obvious and not entirely thought-out, especially when Almodóvar mismanages the handling of truly painful incidents and emotions. It’s also the first time that he has addressed the Spanish civil war, in a remarkably heavy-handed ending. Cruz is terrific, though; we’ll see her again this week in a Spanish film in official competition, called, confusingly, Official Competition.There’s also been a typically exuberant feature from Paolo Sorrentino, the Italian writer-director of that flamboyant fantasia The Great Beauty. He has reined in the excess considerably in The Hand of God, an autobiographical piece about his family life and adolescence in Naples in the 80s. The title refers to Diego Maradona, who played for Napoli before scoring that notorious goal, and to divine intervention, which seems to play a part in the life of young Sorrentino surrogate Fabietto (charismatic, angular Filippo Scotti). It’s a lyrical, unusually direct and emotional film for this director, although Sorrentino’s decidedly old-school gender politics are as glaring as ever in his portrayal of Fabietto’s glamorous aunt and object of desire Patrizia (Luisa Ranieri). For some of the time you grind your teeth, but for much of it you’re bowled over by the sheer brio of a film that’s Sorrentino’s simplest and most engaging to date.In 1973, Ingmar Bergman made a harrowing TV mini-series called Scenes from a Marriage. It has now been remade for HBO by Hagai Levi, the creator of The Affair and the original Israeli In Treatment, with Jessica Chastain and Oscar Isaac as the couple under scrutiny. She’s a technology exec, he’s an academic, and the minute we see them in a long opening sequence, interviewed by a PhD researcher (“I’m interested in the elements that constitute your self-definition”), we know there will be much squirming ahead. The acting and direction are superb and judging by the one episode I saw – out of the complete 5-parter playing here – the series may prove rivetingly that bourgeois angst still has plenty of dramatic mileage to offer.Isaac is superb, too, in Paul Schrader’s The Card Counter, giving a precise, super-enclosed performance as William Tell, a professional card player with a past that’s connected with one of the darkest episodes in recent American history. Recruited by a big-money gambling agent (Tiffany Haddish), he also befriends a young man (Tye Sheridan) who’s on a dangerous revenge mission. Executed with steely detachment, although sometimes overplaying its hand, this is an intense, serious-minded redemption drama. Schrader is one of American cinema’s most uneven auteurs, his work ranging from the brilliance of his recent First Reformed and, of course, his Taxi Driver script to awkward ventures such as 2016’s goofy Dog Eat Dog. If you’d forgotten just how good he can be, here’s an electrifying reminder that may prove one of the boldest things here."
Parallel Mothers review – Almodóvar delivers Venice film festival a little bundle of joy ,"Pedro Almodóvar and Penélope Cruz open the festival with a boisterous, warm-bodied swapped-at-birth melodrama about two single women who meet in a maternity ward",4,"The first day of the Venice film festival is an excitable, expectant affair. The staff wear medical masks, the cinemas have been sanitised and the guests mass at the door like anxious family members outside a maternity ward. Happily they are in good hands; Pedro Almodóvar is the midwife. He delivers an opening night picture that is positively ringing with life.Showcasing a sure-footed performance from Penélope Cruz, Parallel Mothers shapes up as a boisterous swapped-at-birth melodrama, full of mix-ups and moral quandaries, occasionally tilting towards farce. But first appearances are deceptive and the film belies its high-concept conceit. All newborns, we’re told, carry the ghosts of the past in their genes – and so it is with Almodóvar’s latest, which is knotted and subversive; an autopsy of dark Spanish history dressed up as a bright baby shower. It’s a turbulent movie. The ingredients don’t always gel. But it is so generous of spirit that it would be churlish to complain. Most directors give so little. Almodóvar, by contrast, offers an over-abundance of riches.Cruz stars as Janis, a 40-year-old photographer who is determined she will raise her daughter as a single mum, just as her mother and grandmother did before her. In the maternity ward she meets teenager Ana (Milena Smit), who is similarly intent on going it alone. The women become close; they are both in the same boat. Months later, a biological test will establish just how linked these two are.Almodóvar tackles the plot’s twists and turns with his customary energy and abandon, rustling up a robust, warm-bodied celebration of female solidarity and the makeshift families that serve as life rafts to those who feel adrift. The mothers love each other and are raising their children as best as they can. The trouble is that Janis knows the truth and Ana does not, and it is this deceit and its repercussions that steer the film towards its stranger, darker second act.Janis’s married lover, it transpires, is a forensic archaeologist and part of a foundation responsible for exhuming the remains of those killed during the Spanish civil war. She wants his help to reclaim her great-grandfather’s body, supposedly buried in a mass grave outside his old village. Towards the end, the aged locals – mostly women – gather in the meadow for their first sight of old bones. It’s a fresh birth of sorts and in its way just as precious.Let nobody fault Almodóvar’s ambition here. If this finally lacks the polished sweep and completeness of Pain and Glory, his previous feature, it compensates with an air of fraught intimacy and throws out a wealth of ideas, leaving some tantalising loose ends to be picked up and examined. Confined for much of its run to a small quarter of Madrid, Parallel Mothers nonetheless looks, Janus-like, to the past and the future and then dares to join the dots between them. It’s a film that’s bent by hardship and pierced by tragedy but it finally bows out with a message of hope. Almodóvar’s implication is plain. It is only by confronting the crimes of the past (whether recent or historic) that Spain’s faltering modern-day citizens can set things straight and move on. Parallel Mothers is the opening film at the Venice film festival on Wednesday."
Cinderella review – Ella wears the trousers in goofy musical redesign,"With help from mouse-turned-footman James Corden and a genderqueer fairy godparent, Camila Cabello’s Ella gets to go to the ball in an outfit of her own creation",3,"Some movies really make it hard for themselves. Cinderella’s producer-star James Corden staged an intensely annoying traffic-stopping flashmob publicity stunt for which prison sentences for all concerned would not be too harsh. It certainly pre-fluffed the snark glands of social media, with much overexcitement at the thought of a new Cats debacle. But no. Actually, writer-director Kay Cannon’s new Cinderella isn’t bad, and Camila Cabello makes a rather personable lead, carrying off some of the movie’s generous helping of funny lines. Doesn’t she want to go to the ball, testily inquires genderqueer fairy godparent Fab G, played by Billy Porter. “Yes, I was just crying and singing about it,” says Cinderella thoughtfully.Cinderella lives in a quaint Disney-National-Trust village in a vast cottage with her horrid step- (not “ugly”, please) sisters Anastasia (Maddie Baillio) and Drizella (Charlotte Spencer) and fierce stepmother Vivian (Idina Menzel), whose own revisionist third-act redemption is visible a mile away. (They surely missed a trick by not calling her a “conservator”.) Our heroine is actually called Ella: her association with “cinders” is explained, but she never has to scrape out a real fire, nor is one ever lit.The moody and almost extraterrestrially handsome Prince Robert (Nicholas Galitzine) is yearning for true love, unlike Cinderella, whose emotions are focused elsewhere: she wants professional recognition for her vocation as a fashion designer and dressmaker. Robert is under pressure from his parents, especially grouchy King Rowan (an outrageous scene-stealer from Pierce Brosnan), a testy and insecure monarch who has secretly modified his throne so it’s higher than the queen’s, and keeps a choir on standby in the throne room to punctuate his angry declarations with mood-music stings. There is also Queen Beatrice, elegantly played by Minnie Driver, who at one stage is rocking a glorious white fencing outfit. They decree a ball shall be held to find the prince’s bride, so Cinderella is very excited to attend in one of her own creations. And this is where Fab G comes in, magicking up the couture from Cinderella’s drawing board and transforming the three mice in her cottage into three bickering Brit comics: Romesh Ranganathan, James Acaster and Corden.Prince Robert incidentally has a sister, Princess Gwen (Tallulah Greive), who has 80s Sloane Lady Di-era short hair and an enthusiasm for reformist government. I wonder if the film-makers were thinking about giving us a boldly inclusive romantic plot twist for Princess Gwen – did they maybe lose their nerve?This is clearly very different from Kenneth Branagh’s very trad fairytale Cinderella from 2015, starring Lily James, but doing Cinderella straight is almost unthinkable in 2021. A new interpretation is mandatory, and there happens also to be another counter-Cinderella, or Cinderella 2.0, on stage right now in the form of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s new musical, written by Emerald Fennell. But satirising a fairytale’s heteronormative patriarchal mythology is going to be tricky if that mythology is needed to sell the movie globally, and you wind up making some sort of accommodation: starting out Corbyn and ending Starmer.Actually, Branagh’s version, like the notorious 1977 soft-porn musical The Other Cinderella, was a little bit more candid about the fitting of the glass slipper, with all its Freudian associations. This movie rather fudges that climactic moment, but has charm in its goofy way: a good-natured and easygoing revival. And Brosnan has an excellent line in ordering sulky Robert to prepare for the ball: “If a rich man ever lost a woman,” he explains witheringly, “it’s to a man who could dance.” True. Cinderella is released on 3 September on Amazon Prime Video."
Shorta review – Danish urban thriller gets the heart pumping,Two cops are stranded in hostile territory when an act of police brutality triggers a riot in this slick action film,3,"Denmark’s reputation as the land of tolerance, equality and cosy contentment takes a battering in this superslick urban thriller directed with adrenaline and savvy by first timers Frederik Louis Hviid and Anders Ølholm. “Shorta” is Arabic for “police”, and the movie opens with black teenager Talib Ben Hassi lying face down, a white police officer on his back. “I can’t breathe,” he pleads. We don’t see Talib again but his name is repeated over and over: on the streets in Svalegårdena, the fictional estate where he grew up; by TV journalists reporting on his condition in intensive care; at the police station where damage limitation is in overdrive.Officers are warned to stay out of Svalegårdena – a powder keg waiting to explode. The shift commander puts solidly decent Jens (Simon Sears) in a car with repellent racist Mike (Jacob Hauberg Lohmann), a man who demands respect by bullying and intimidation. The script sets up these familiar cop stereotypes then messes with them – not massively convincingly to be honest. Jens in particular I found difficult to get a handle on; this is a film where characters act in ways to make the plot tick more than anything else. Things go wrong when Mike stops and searches cheeky Arab kid Amos (Tarek Zayat). He goes in hard, humiliates Amos, arrests him; at that moment news breaks that Talib is dead, triggering a riot.What follows is a classic and supremely effective behind-enemy-lines movie: cops Jens and Mike are trapped inside this concrete jungle of high-rise flats, pursued by a gang on mopeds in balaclavas. There are plenty of heart-pumping moments, plus a fair few false notes, a couple of implausible coincidences and some exposition-y dialogue spelling out the film’s message, which is about how the two sides see each other. “If you’re always treated like something you’re not, you end up believing it,” says Amos’s mum. Her disillusioned son makes the point far better in a story he tells about being kicked out of a youth football team run by cops when another kid invented a story about him pulling out a knife. Shorta is released on 3 September in cinemas."
The Champion of Auschwitz review – Polish boxer fights to live in sturdy drama,"Dramatising the true story of Teddi Pietrzykowski, an internee who fought to entertain the guards, this is a solid, occasionally sentimental tale",3,"This cleanly hewn drama from Poland, surely destined to be Poland’s submission for the Academy Awards, tells the true story of Tadeusz Pietrzykowski, AKA “Teddi”, a (non-Jewish) Polish bantamweight boxer who was one of the earliest prisoners at Auschwitz. There have actually been a couple of other films about Pietrzykowski over the years, which might explain why writer-director Maciej Barczewski, making an impressive debut here, doesn’t go into a lot of detail about how Teddi fought Nazis at the start of the war during the siege of Warsaw in 1939. Instead, a few slow-motion flashbacks are deemed sufficient to ground the story while the film settles down to the grim business of following Teddi as he tries to survive the camp by getting assigned to a work detail. Inevitably, a lot of this work involves disposing of the dead, and trying not to listen to the screams as Jews deemed too weak for work assignments are herded into the gas chamber on their arrival at the camp.When a German officer recognises Teddi from his prewar fighting career, an opportunity opens up for Teddi to fight in a makeshift ring for the entertainment of the bored German soldiers. When he survives his first bout thanks to his exceptional skills in dodging punches, he gets an extra ration of bread and starts sharing it with the other men. He grows fond of a teenager named Janek (Jan Szydlowski) who, like Teddi, keeps managing to duck out of the grasp of death and go on surviving.If you don’t already know about Pietrzykowski’s story, there’s genuine suspense in watching and hoping that this decent guy, played with tremendous physical prowess and quiet dignity by Piotr Glowacki, will make it through. There are a few sentimental touches that grate, particularly the deployment of hokey Catholic symbolism and the obligatory training montage, while some might find a few of the Nazi characters a bit too sympathetic given the circumstances. Nevertheless, the result is a sturdy work, backed with a lovely full orchestral score. The Champion of Auschwitz is released on 3 September in cinemas."
The Nest review – Jude Law flies home in a riveting neoliberal fever dream,A dark Surrey manor house gives its new American family a chilly welcome in Sean Durkin’s 80s-set ghost story cum emotional parable,4,"Is it a ghost story? A parable of family dysfunction? Or perhaps a fever dream of neoliberalism’s troubled birth in the Thatcher-Reagan 80s and the special relationship of greed and good? Or is this rivetingly strange movie an adaptation of some 70s or 80s novel that we had somehow all forgotten about: something by Iris Murdoch, or maybe Piers Paul Read? The Nest’s director is film-maker Sean Durkin, his first since the intriguing quasi-Manson cult drama Martha Marcy May Marlene from 2011, and however much it feels like an adaptation, this is his own original screenplay – and very original.The setting is the mid-1980s, with news about President Reagan on the radio and everyone smoking indoors, and the story begins in the handsome suburban home in upstate New York of Rory O’Hara, an expatriate Briton played by Jude Law. He has made a fortune as a commodity trader in Manhattan and one morning high-handedly tells his American wife Allison (Carrie Coon), stepdaughter Sam (Oona Roche) and young son Ben (Charlie Shotwell) that he has accepted a job offer from his old boss in the City of London. Restless, mercurial, fast-talking Rory evidently has a yen to return in triumph to his old stamping ground, and maybe cautiously reconnect with his glowering widowed mum – a terrifically potent cameo from Anne Reid.And so the bewildered family leave the sunny US for rainy old Britain, where Rory has rented a huge, dark, 18th-century manor house in Surrey with first editions and panelled walls and secret passages, which he excitedly tells them was the temporary home of Led Zeppelin while they worked on an album. He encourages Allison to pursue her interest in horses here and packs Ben off to the nearest posh school where he has to wear a uniform with mortifyingly uncool short trousers while sulky, mutinous Sam gets to go to the local comprehensive. But soon it is clear that Rory’s job isn’t going so well, Allison is angry and depressed, Sam is getting into drugs and Ben is wetting the bed. And there are very disquieting ghostly things happening in this absurd stately home, symptoms of psychic pain that are also being intuited by Allison’s horse.No one actually calls this house the nest, and a less nest-like home can hardly be imagined: uncomfy, uncosy, unwelcoming and unhappy – or, perhaps, the point is that nests are exactly like this, in the wild. Certainly, there’s something utterly bizarre in the simple transplanting of this happy, prosperous cornfed American family into a dank, draughty mausoleum, the kind of place that poor, unsatisfied Rory needs to persuade himself that he has properly made it, commuting every day and drinking pensive lagers on the train.While Rory is in the office, doing boozy lunches or going to Arsenal games with his old mate Steve (Adeel Akhtar), and recklessly spending on the expectation of some big deal, it’s Allison and the kids who are back in this creepy old mansion, unsure as to why the tradesmen aren’t getting paid and the cheques are bouncing. She is wondering: are they, in fact, terribly poor? And the creature who senses all this in a series of surreal and shockingly unpleasant sequences is Allison’s horse Richmond, whose burial scene is one of the most disturbing things I have seen this year. You watch as the perfect Anglo-American family teeters on the edge of emotional bankruptcy.This is a film that swerves away from categorisation. It’s an 80-set picture that wears its period locations and its musical references lightly. It’s a city trader film where the main bad guy doesn’t do coke. And it’s a scary movie whose disturbing supernatural interludes happen almost incidentally, a sideshow to the emotional collapse. The Nest is released on 27 August in cinemas."
Our Ladies review – choir of convent schoolgirls cuts loose in Edinburgh,This adaptation of Alan Warner’s The Sopranos is led by a terrific ensemble cast – though some of the gags feel dated post #MeToo,3,"After Alan Warner published his brilliant and hilarious third novel The Sopranos in 1998, about a group of working-class convent schoolgirls on the rampage in Edinburgh, for years the big surprise has been that it hasn’t been turned into a film. Now, finally, here it is, an adaptation of The Sopranos (renamed, for obvious reasons) – and the thing is, it’s a few years too late. Post #MeToo, there are scenes here that are a bit off; in all honesty, though, they might have felt wrong as far back as the Rotherham child abuse scandal. Such as the moment when the girls on the back of the coach flash their bras and wave “shag me” signs to passing builders’ vans.Still, plenty of Warner’s wonderfully un-PC gags stand the test of time. “Why are nuns ballbags?” asks one of the girls. “Low wages and no sex,” jokes her mate. What’s more, Rob Roy director Michael Caton-Jones has assembled a terrific, full-of-energy ensemble cast of unknown actors to play the girls of Our Lady of Succour’s choir.It’s set in the mid-90s; Orla (Tallulah Greive) is the school’s miracle after recovering from leukaemia, supposedly at Lourdes. She’s up for losing her virginity on the choir’s day trip to Edinburgh from Fort William for a singing competition. Marli Siu plays Kylah, the cool-girl punk singer with the voice of an angel. Manda (Sally Messham) is a bully; Chell (Rona Morison) has been “loopy” since her dad died. Kay (Eve Austin) is the butter-wouldn’t-melt head girl. Abigail Lawrie gives the performance of the film as Finnoula, whose cleverness feels like a curse; she can see how her future is mapped out by class and poverty. “This town is a graveyard for us,” she says.Like I say, there is a lot to like here – but there’s no escaping how dated some of the material is. I remember reading the book in the 00s, thinking how heroic the girls’ joyous boozing, puking and shagging was – a glorious two fingers up at those who wrote them off as the mindless underclass. Now I watch their encounters with dodgy older blokes thinking how vulnerable their real-life counterparts are. A wee tweak here and there might have fixed it. Our Ladies is released on 27 August in cinemas."
He’s All That review – Netflix’s dull TikTok teen remake lacks charm,A gender-swapped remake of She’s All That casts TikTok star Addison Rae as the lead in bland nostalgia bait that appeals to no one,2,"For the majority of people too young to remember the premiere of She’s All That in 1999, the main draw of He’s All That, Netflix’s gender-swapped remake of the teen classic, is its casting of the TikTok star Addison Rae. In July 2019, an 18-year-old Rae, given name Addison Rae Easterling, went from freshman at Louisiana State University to one of the most recognizable faces of Gen Z basically overnight, when she started posting short dance clips to TikTok.Now 20, Rae has become the face of forces far out of her control: the popularization of dance moves without choreographer credit, the unfathomable fame accrued by average dancing with expressive faces, and most especially the blandness of “straight TikTok” or, as Rebecca Jennings put it in Vox, “pretty people filming themselves being pretty” for an algorithm that rewards mediocrity.Rae is thus a fitting star for yet another under-baked reboot of teen IP – like the TikTokers appealing to the median of everyone’s average tastes, He’s All That, directed by Mark Waters from a script by R Lee Fleming Jr, is uninspiring, trying very hard to appear like it’s breezy, probably popular in the sense of cultural saturation but appealing deeply to no one.To be clear, I do not blame this on Rae, who appears to be sincerely trying in her first screen role as Padgett Sawyer, AKA @PadgettHeadtoToe, a high school senior and influencer. An inverse of Freddie Prinze Jr’s privileged golden boy Zachary Siler, Padgett hides her middle-income roots (her mother, played by original star Rachael Leigh Cook, is a nurse) behind a facade of glamour – she lies to her friends about her address; she is perennially, often obnoxiously “on”.The beats of the 90-minute film mirror the original: within minutes, Padgett has discovered her boyfriend, a wannabe viral music star with bleached hair named Jordan Van Draanen (Peyton Meyer), cheating, had her livestreamed humiliation go viral for a particularly unflattering shot of a tearful snot bubble, lost her sponsorships, and bet her social rehabilitation on the makeover of a dud guy of her frenemy Alden’s (Madison Pettis) choosing. The terms: turn Cameron Kweller (Tanner Buchanan), a cynical outcast with a shaggy haircut, beanie and a passion for photography and horses, into prom king in six weeks or be branded a loser, or something.Though Fleming’s script plays like an adult man’s approximation of Gen Z tropes (“put your TikToks down and you can see some real dancing!” says the principal, played by Matthew Lillard (the original’s Brock Hudson) at the improbably named Cali High’s prom), it at least doesn’t drag. He’s All That swiftly proceeds through a slideshow of restaged scenes with slight 2021 hallmarks: Gatsby-themed party scene, cameo from Rae pal Kourtney Kardashian as a drolly ruthless brand manager, the ever-present stress of follower counts.There are some welcome updates to the original: whereas Zach stressed about not being able to decide between a handful of other elite schools (the horror!), Padgett more realistically worries about being able to pay for college without her brand deals (bleak). Both Cam and the original’s Laney have lost their moms, but the remake digs ever so slightly deeper into the lasting damage of that grief via Cam’s ebullient younger sister Brin (Isabella Crovetti, the strongest young actor here).Other choices fare less well. The original’s seminal prom choreography – Usher leading a dance-off to Fatboy Slim’s Rockafeller Skank – gets TikTokified (torso-heavy dance moves) to a nondescript hip-hop song that is nowhere near as catchy. The fashion is confounding – it’s hard to imagine Rae, whose Gen Z popularity is predicated on the recognition and adaptation of hyper-transient trends, wearing any of the frumpy sweater dresses or cardigans she sports in the film.He’s All That does get points for not being too faithful – the update thankfully eschews some of the original’s most glaring flaws, namely: the objectification of women, fatphobia and, most egregiously, the playing of scumbag Dean’s (Paul Walker) sexual harassment of Laney for laughs.But the censorship carries too far; whereas the original’s teens smoked, drank, vomited, made out and lay in bed together, He’s All That presents a high school in which students drink fancy mocktails, barely kiss and avoid swearing. It’s maybe for the best that there’s no pube pizza here, but the obvious avoidance of anything remotely racy lends the movie a sterile, uncanny feel.It’s the same feeling, really, as watching a bunch of straight TikToks. While Rae offers flashes of promise, especially when she pops her genuinely winning smile, she doesn’t make the case for TikTok-to-film-stardom here. The chemistry between her and Buchanan is stilted, at best. But it would be unfair to place the movie’s dullness on her shoulders. She’s one of many algorithmically successful parts in this ultimately stale bait for nostalgia, a recipe that does not amount to charm.He’s All That is now available on Netflix"
Vacation Friends review – raucous summer comedy is a washout ,A talented cast can’t do enough to save an almost entirely unfunny film about two discordant couples who meet on holiday and find themselves in chaos,2,"There’s a sense of strained desperation behind the title of the crude summer comedy Vacation Friends that seeps through to the film itself, the bullish insistence that, yes, Vacation Friends is a phrase that people frequently use is as deranged as assuming that something as utterly disposable as Vacation Friends needs to exist right now. There’s a migraine-inducing amount of content being thrown at us, especially in the last year, and this downgraded time-waster (from a Fox theatrical release to a Hulu/Disney streaming premiere) is exactly the kind of thing we don’t have time for, vacation or no.It’s a sloppy throwback to both the 80s, when perhaps Dan Aykroyd and John Candy would have starred, and then also the 00s, when Ben Stiller and Will Ferrell would have led, the kind of thing that seems deceptively easy to get right but when it’s done wrong, it’s abundantly clear that’s very much not the case. The base ingredients are here – a charming, comically adept cast, a fun culture clash set-up, idyllic scenery! – but they’re carelessly tossed together rather than combined with any thought, care or even slickness. Director Clay Tarver and his four (!) co-writers smooth over the many cracks with in-your-face lewdness intended to shock but instead it exhausts, each act of provocation causing not our jaws to drop but our eyes to roll even further back. How did something so breezy end up feeling like a chore?Marcus (Lil Rel Howery) is taking his girlfriend Emily (Yvonne Orji) to Mexico for a vacation and also as an extravagant way of finally popping the question. But despite priding himself on his ability to plan every inch of his life, Marcus finds that his romantic proposal is a disaster when their five-star suite is flooded. With the only other option being an airport Best Western the two are taken in by rowdy couple Ron (John Cena) and Kyla (Meredith Hagner). The differences between the couples are strikingly clear (Ron and Kyla are more cocaine and guns while Marcus and Emily are more not cocaine and guns) but they find an unusual, tequila-fuelled bond, at least while surrounded by the artificiality of being so far from home. When their week ends, the pair are happy to leave their more extreme counterparts behind but seven months later, as their wedding beckons back in Atlanta, Ron and Kyla reappear and threaten to destroy everything.There’s something undeniably interesting, if not exactly unexplored, in examining who we are and what we might tolerate while on vacation, all of us having some experience of a holiday fling or an unlikely friendship that was designed purely for that time and never to be revisited again. It’s a space where we might do or say things we wouldn’t in our normal lives, a brief chance to reinvent and reinvigorate, and so with Vacation Friends, we’re given a scenario that explains why a more strait-laced couple would let their hair down with quite so much gusto for seven days. But Tarver’s film throws them, and us, right in the deep end from the outset, drowning whatever chance he might have had at getting us to believe a single thing that then happens. Rather than a growing escalation of wild behaviour, Ron and Kyla immediately start acting in such cartoonishly outsized ways that we struggle to understand why anyone would want to spend another second around them.Within minutes of meeting, they try to spike Marcus and Emily’s drinks with cocaine they smuggled into Mexico before a series of far-fetched situations involving more drugs, a gun, physical altercations and an orgy. The five (!) writers involved with the script aren’t able to find a way to make the friendship make much sense and so it’s hard to care about the chaos that ruins their wedding back in Atlanta, every ridiculous red flag moment one that’s entirely deserved. In the Farrelly brothers’ wildly underrated remake of The Heartbreak Kid (a Mexico-set comedy that’s every bit as crude as this), Malin Akerman’s unhinged new wife is that much more effective because she starts out as someone whose flaws are hidden or at least disguised by how she looks and how much Ben Stiller’s eager bachelor wants to love her. But starting out at 100 is a misstep this film isn’t able to get over and the cycle of wild act followed by sighs and face-palming gets tired real fast.The underserved cast try their best to distract, with Cena and Howery building on recently adopted personas well, the latter deservedly and comfortably settling into lead over supporting. Orji, the MVP of HBO’s incisive comedy Insecure, gets very little to do and does it well enough but it’s Hagner, who stole every single one of her scenes in Search Party, who continues to do the same here, getting the biggest laughs, almost entirely based on her delivery rather than what she has to work with. The script is remarkably low on genuinely funny lines or set pieces, opting for broad mania over specificity which makes the last act sentimentality even harder to stomach.Like Ron and Kyla, Vacation Friends outstays its welcome and then some.Vacation Friends is now available on Hulu in the US and on Star on Disney+ in the UK"
Alia’s Birth review – a loosely collaged portrait of a foundering relationship,"An understated, graphic-novel-esque take on desire and connection is threaded through with humour",3,"An affecting – and apparently real – home-birth sequence comprises the last 15 minutes of Egyptian film-maker Sam Abbas’s otherwise fictional short feature. The sudden onrush of biological imperative gives this footage a gripping undeniability and focus that this loosely collaged account of a foundering Brooklyn relationship has been searching for – or perhaps that its characters are dodging.It’s not the film’s central couple, though, who are having a child. Present in the apartment is Jamie (Poorna Jagannathan), who with Jenna (Maya Kazan) appears to be acting as a doula, a kind of spiritual guide, to the parents-to-be. Jenna strongly resembles Tess (Nikohl Boosheri), the partner with whom we see Jenna sharing her life in the film’s initial section. They take pottery classes, traipse through an exhibition, order antidepressants; all activities grasping for completeness but undertaken with an undertow of disquiet.Then their paths separate, as they are “forced” to spend the night apart, in the words of the film’s summary – though, as per Abbas’s elliptical style, this isn’t clear from watching what actually happens. Tess meets a man at a gig by real-life techno DJ Nicole Moudaber, and he later forces himself on to her; Jamie sulkily masturbates at home and, heading out, is speculatively chatted up by a goateed divorcee.The extreme understatedness is a little frustrating, and it feels like this is the consequence of a piece perhaps opportunistically cobbled together in the edit. But, the indulgent three-and-a-half-minute dancefloor shot apart, Abbas does this with considerable precision. His graphic-novel-esque tableau style carefully distils his themes of desire and connection, with humour threading through the ennui. An awkward interaction about choosing a vibrator cuts to a shot of two fingers inside the rim of a pot. For all its meandering, this has a human touch.Alia’s Birth is available on 27 August on digital platforms."
Paris Calligrammes review – a portrait overflowing with joy and political urgency,Ulrike Ottinger’s recollections of life as a budding artist in 1960s Paris challenge the city’s image as a creative utopia,4,"Mostly comprising of a voiceover and archival footage, German auteur Ulrike Ottinger’s new film feels like a stylistic shift from the avant-garde, carnivalesque works of queer radicalism for which she is best known. Underneath the unhurried pace and the exhaustive account of Ottinger’s experience of 1960s Paris as a budding artist, there is a politically conscious playfulness that displays her ability to interweave different art forms and storytelling styles.True to its title, the film rolls like a calligram, a text format where words are arranged to form a thematically relevant image. Ottinger’s recollections of past encounters with intellectual and artistic luminaries coalesce into a portrait of Paris, as well as herself. Calligrammes is the name of a bookstore owned by Fritz Picard that became a literary haven for Jewish émigrés; here, Ottinger crossed path with the likes of Tristan Tzara and Walter Mehring. The seemingly endless possibilities of life in Paris go on, like working next to Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir at cafes, seeing Georges Méliès’ films at Henri Langlois’ Cinémathèque Française, and listening to Juliette Gréco in nightclubs.Paris Calligrammes rises above empty nostalgia, however. In a film filled to the brim with images and references, Ottinger’s voice becomes a fascinating and beguiling anchor: the measured tone, along with the mature earthiness of the vocal cords, creates an arresting graininess that challenges the image of Paris as a creative utopia. Nestled between the starry encounters is Ottinger’s reckoning with the colonial and racist history of France, including the near-forgotten Paris massacre of 1961. Ultimately, this masterly documentary is a psychogeographical exercise at its fullest potency and determination, overflowing with joy and political urgency all at once. Paris Calligrammes is released on 27 August in cinemas"
Deed of Death review – Malay martial arts flick earns points for authenticity,"Drawing its cast from the silat schools of Malaysia, this action film is an enthusiastic celebration of the indigenous martial art, but ultimately fails to land its punches ",2,"Director Areel Abu Bakar celebrates Malay martial arts in this film about a humble family’s attempts to bring a wayward son back to the fold. Mat Arip (Fad Anuar) has been using his father’s property deed as collateral for his gambling debts, which gives loan shark Kahar (Azlan Komeng) an opportunity to exact long-desired vengeance against the father (played by popular Malaysian actor-director, Namron). It won’t be easy, since both Mat Arip’s brother Ali (Khoharullah Majid) and sister Fatimah (Feiyna Tajudin) are experts in silat seni gayong. This is the unarmed combat style brought to the Malay peninsula by 18th-century Bugis warriors, and still taught to the Malaysian police force.Bakar has sourced most of the cast for his film from the silat training centres of northern Malaysia. No doubt this brings authenticity, but the lack of stunt professionals also tells in some clearly visible two-inch gaps between punches and opponents’ body parts. Any such amateurish mistakes are, however, mostly obscured by an enthusiastic, Shaw Brothers-style soundtrack of grunts, thwacks and hiii-yahs. More of a problem is the superfluous inclusion of drag racing in a martial arts movie. You can see the “something for everyone” logic, but there is nothing fast or furious about the many scenes of pre-race peacocking, while the GoPro car interior shots are unpleasantly reminiscent of Top Gear.At least – from a Malaysian audience point of view – Deed of Death saves the best till last: an extended fight scene for three-time silat world champion Khoharullah Majid, who has spent most of the previous runtime toiling in a paddy field. But general audiences may be more charmed by stereotype-flouting bouts involving sister Fatimah: the traditional hijab and baju kurung outfit is no impediment to her high kicks. Deed of Death is released on 23 August on digital platforms."
People Just Do Nothing: Big in Japan review – one giant leap for the BBC mockumentary,The Kurupt FM crew strike it rich in Tokyo in this warmly funny spin-off feature,4,"Rarely does a half-hour TV show successfully stretch itself into a 90-minute film. It’s a nice surprise, then, that the popular BBC mockumentary works as a feature. It’s been 15 years since the golden age of garage, and Kurupt FM’s MC Grindah (Allan Mustafa) is now a postman, while DJ Beats (Hugo Chegwin) works at a bowling alley. Sure, they only ever had two tracks, but when one, the hilariously titled Heart Monitor Riddem, ends up appearing on a Japanese gameshow, manager Chabuddy G (Asim Chaudhry, a proud, bumbling highlight) wrangles the whole gang an all-expenses-paid trip to meet record-label executives in Tokyo.While it’s pretty standard idiots abroad stuff, there’s a sweetness to the characters that stops the comedy from feeling crass. It’s genuinely touching when Beats performs Dry Your Eyes by the Streets in a high-rise karaoke bar, while the perpetually stoned Steves (Steve Stamp) has the air of a helpless puppy, swaddled in an inflatable life vest on the plane."
Sabaya review – extraordinary documentary shows struggle to free women kidnapped by Isis,Hogir Hirori’s film follows Mahmud as he and his team of volunteers infiltrate the dangerous al-Hawl camp in Syria to liberate Yazidi women trafficked as sex slaves,4,"The first 20 minutes of Hogir Hirori’s extraordinary documentary has the beat of a gripping thriller, full of hushed voices, car chases, and the terrifying sounds of gunfight. Much of it shot at night, the film follows Mahmud, a member of an organisation called the Yazidi Home Center (YHC), and his trips with other volunteers to the dangerous al-Hawl camp in Syria which holds people with Isis links. The group’s goal is to retrieve and rescue Yazidi women who were kidnapped and sex-trafficked by Isis. Termed “sabaya” by their captors, the women endured unimaginable abuse, leaving them with debilitating lifelong trauma.Intertwining with these tense, heartbreaking moments is the mundane daily life at Mahmud’s house, which doubles as a temporary shelter for the women. Recurring moments of his mother making food or his young son playing about the courtyard act as a calming balm to the victims’ psychological hurt, a semblance of the normality that hopefully awaits them in their home town in Sinjar. Sabaya is also especially poignant in how it doesn’t see Mahmud as a heroic figure. There’s a moving matter-of-factness to his routine of checking the continuous messages from people seeking their loved ones or his calm confrontation with Isis sympathisers who hide the Yazidi women in the camp.Equally astonishing is the bravery of former sabayas who return to the camp as infiltrators for YHC. Just like Mahmud, they too share a staggeringly unruffled resilience, considering the danger of their tasks and the ordeal they have suffered. At one point, the group calmly discuss whether to fetch their weapon from a car as bullets are flying nearby. This is all complemented by Hirori’s unvarnished handheld cinematography that does not sensationalise the women’s plight; instead it respectfully and sombrely makes tangible their harrowing experience. Sabaya is released on 20 August in cinemas."
Climate of the Hunter review – intoxicating vampire flick from ‘Backwoods Bergman’,Every wacky detail of indie auteur Mickey Reece’s movie is a reminder of what fun even the oddest art films can be,4,"If you’re an aficionado of Oklahoma’s DIY arts scene, you’ve likely heard of “the Flyover Fassbinder” AKA “the Backwoods Bergman” AKA musican-turned-film-maker, Mickey Reece. For everyone else: welcome to the party. This languid and lascivious vampire movie is the first of the indie auteur’s 37 no-budget films to make it much past the US south-west’s film festival circuit. Reece has modestly described his style as “people talking in rooms” – but, oh what people! His other films tell of demonically possessed nuns, cryogenically frozen country singers and Elvis Presley; Climate of the Hunter is a kind of 70s erotic horror pastiche about two middle-aged sisters, Alma (Ginger Gilmartin) and Elizabeth (Mary Buss), vying for the attentions of their house guest.Philosophising lothario Wesley (Ben Hall) is an old friend, but it seems he’s changed in the two decades since they saw him last. He’s taken to sleeping during the day, has developed an allergy to garlic and is despised by his adult son Percy (Sheridan McMichael), whose camp surliness is very like Dan Levy in Schitt’s Creek). Alma’s conspiracy theorist neighbour BJ Beavers (Jacob Ryan Snovel) is the first to suggest that Wesley might not be “one of us”.As for Reece’s “rooms”: Climate of the Hunter was clearly shot in someone’s friend’s mother’s off-season holiday cabin, possibly during a week between bookings, but is no less intoxicating for it. The dialogue nicely melds wackiness with melodrama, and every detail, from the nauseating dinner spreads – tuna jello salad, anyone? – to Elizabeth’s severe white eye makeup, is a reminder of what fun even the oddest art films can be. Sure, there’s not much of a plot, but these Mickey Reece movies are a mood unto themselves. The campaign for a BFI season starts here. Climate of the Hunter is released on 23 August on digital platforms."
"Barbie: Big City, Big Dreams review – Malibu Barbie finally meets her match","The fashion doll gets a new BFF, Brooklyn Barbie, in her 39th animated movie – a garishly pink musical, despite efforts to address diverse body-image issues",2,"A live action Barbie movie directed by Greta Gerwig and starring Margot Robbie is on its way; in the meantime there’s this: the 39th animated feature for the improbably proportioned fashion doll. And you thought Rocky had a lot of sequels. Since 2001, when Mattel first discovered a computer-animated film franchise could be used to drive up doll sales, Barbie has swum with dolphins, joined a spy squad and had more “princess adventures” than Meghan Markle on a wilderness trek.This time, she leaves her Malibu Dreamhouse to spend the summer at a performing arts programme in NYC, and no sooner has her yellow taxi crossed the Hudson than she’s making forever friends. Her main new pal is Barbie’s doppelganger in all but skin tone and hair texture. Since they even have the same name (“It’s cosmic destiny!”), they decide to go by home town monikers. And yes, Brooklyn Barbie is already available at all good toy retailers. “Malibu” and “Brooklyn” then prepare to perform at the end of term show, with a little help from a flamboyant fashion student and, for some reason, a cute puppy.It’s a backstage musical in essence, spiced up slightly with a subplot about a teen pop sensation struggling to break free from her controlling father. (Remind you of anyone? #FreeBritney.) The animation is flat and garishly pink, but the writing does demonstrate some effort to answer Barbie’s critics on diverse body-image issues. Which is to say, there’s no substantive challenge to beauty norms but Brooklyn Barbie does wrap her afro hair at night. It’s also a plus that the R&B-pop songs actually bang, especially a Gwen Stefani-esque number about overwork. If the accompanying dance routines seem cloddish, that’s only apt: Barbie doesn’t bend at the knee or elbow joints, after all. Barbie: Big City, Big Dreams is released on 20 August in cinemas."
"Batman & Robin: time to revisit Joel Schumacher’s maligned, silly and endlessly quotable film",The widely detested 1997 adaptation and its various bizarre spin-offs are worth a reappraisal in this era in which nothing makes sense,0,"Serious comic book fans and discerning cinephiles consider director Joel Schumacher’s Batman & Robin from 1997 one of the worst films ever made – but they are wrong. It’s easily more entertaining than Christopher Nolan’s feted Batman trilogy (come at me Nolanites) – an endlessly quotable and absurd corporate climate change parable and the source of teenage mania among my early 2000s high school friends.The intensely silly caper is more reminiscent of the 60s TV show, and Silver Age comics, than the brooding 80s publications that inspired Nolan and everyone since. Fans were understandably upset with the film’s reduction of Bane (one of Batman’s most intelligent foes) to a witless henchman; but in The Dark Knight Rises, Nolan and Tom Hardy turned Bane into a helium-fuelled, amateur Shakespearean actor, so, whatever.Batman & Robin’s plot revolves around its villains – the eco-fascist Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman) and romantic snowman Mr Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger) – and their attempts to terraform Gotham for the benefit of their loved ones and plants. Go deeper though, and it emerges as a morally complex climate change allegory, in which two visionary scientists attempt to save the planet from the relentlessly destructive capitalism of billionaire psychopaths like George Clooney’s Bruce Wayne.Looking back on the film, it’s remarkable to see how far we’ve come from the homophobic and insecure criticisms of the film’s hot introduction of nippled Batsuits. And how Poison Ivy was afforded far more complexity of character than Nolan (a known sideliner of female characters) gave to Anne Hathaway’s Catwoman; or how Mr Freeze’s escape rocket was clearly the prototype for Jeff Bezos’s “anthropomorphic” spaceship.Analysing the film for this column, though, has been fraught. It was dropped from Binge a week before the original publication date, subsequently directing our attention to the film’s wild cultural byproducts. Despite Clooney’s fears they had “just killed the franchise” this thing has legs, wings, or tendrils, stalactites even, that extend far beyond the film proper and remain frozen in the cultural ether.For one, Batman & Robin has an excellent soundtrack, featuring an at-the-height-of-their-powers Smashing Pumpkins, Jewel’s classic Foolish Games, a Bone Thugs-n-Harmony banger, and a hectic techno sermon from Underworld.Most delirious though, is the Batman & Robin Audio Action Adventure – a bizarre 34-minute storybook retelling of the film, with relentless foley and sound effects complementing the dubious talents of ring-in voice actors doing their best takes on Clooney’s Batman, Chris O’Donnell’s Robin and Alicia Silverstone’s Batgirl (sadly an Austrian stand-in for Schwarzenegger wasn’t cast).Mr Freeze has 27 ice puns in the film – his “Tonight’s forecast: a Freeze is coming” line is arguably the second most quotable moment in any Batman film (as well as the second best villain) behind Heath Ledger’s Joker’s “Why so serious?”. The Audio Adventure adds in extra pun-ishment missing from the film (describing a frozen security guard as a “copsicle” is an early ripper).My friend Andrew found the Audio Adventure CD in a Wellington record store sales bin. Another friend, Adrian, theorised that “it was intended for parents to put on for their six-year-old, and tell them to shut up and eat their cheese and apple”. My most memorable teenage listening session of the Audio Adventure took place at Andrew’s parents’ place, among clouds of smoke, in one of many teenage “hot rooms”: a ritualistic process in which the smallest possible rooms of absent parents’ houses were packed with multiple heaters, becoming dank folkloric caves to shield us from brutal Wellington winters (which somehow feels connected to the film’s plot).Neither Batman & Robin: An Audio Action Adventure, or the hot room, make sense – but right now nothing does. So if seven seasons of Mad Men feels like a slog, then it’s time to crank the heaters and suit up for an audio superhero odyssey. If you can make it through the Action Adventure’s full, feverish, chaotic runtime, you can make it through lockdown. And if that’s too outlandish for you, fear not – there’s no stopping this Batsled. Batman & Robin, the motion picture, is back on Stan."
"Josee, the Tiger and the Fish review – beautiful-looking anime takes a trip to the zoo",This romantic animation about a paraplegic woman’s relationship with a marine biology student suffers for its sweetness,3,"This gorgeous-looking, swooningly romantic anime feels like it could win over YA audiences: it’s heartfelt, unthreatening and rather lovely. Its representation of disability does feel a bit iffy in places, though: presenting a 24-year-old paraplegic woman, Josee, as fundamentally in need of fixing or rescue. Near the start she meets Tsuneo, a dreamily gorgeous diver and marine biology student, who saves her hurtling out of control down a hill in her wheelchair. She is a helpless victim – and not for the last time in the movie.When Tsuneo walks Josee back to her apartment, her grandmother hires him as a part-time carer. The job involves spending a couple of hours with Josee every day. The one rule is that he can’t take her outside. At first, Tsuneo can’t stand his petulant and demanding client, who calls him “my servant” and orders him around. But slowly he’s smitten and develops something worryingly like a saviour complex. It turns out that Josee’s overprotective grandmother has kept her confined at home to make sure she is safe. As a result, she is childish and emotionally immature, but a fiercely talented artist.Of course, the two eventually break the stay-at-home rule. Josee comes face to face with the tiger of the movie’s title at a zoo; it is here that director Kôtarô Tamura hits you with the unsubtle message of the movie, that life is full of danger and beauty. But the animation is lush, with glowing golden autumn cherry tree leaves and bugs swarming around a lamp at night. There’s a magical dream – is it hers or his? – of Josee swimming like a mermaid in the sea. But even in its moments of jeopardy there is very little danger and the sweetness of the movie’s temper makes it a just a little cloying. Josee, the Tiger and the Fish is released on 11 August in cinemas."
Shershaah review – Sidharth Malhotra stars in nuance-free military biopic,"Karan Johar-produced film about Vikram Batra, who died in the 1999 India-Pakistan conflict, promotes him as a model citizen – with model looks to boot",2,"Hot on the heels of Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl, last year’s biopic of one of the hardier combatants in the India-Pakistan conflict of 1999, mega-producer Karan Johar offers a disappointingly generic tribute to Vikram Batra, killed in the same conflict aged just 24. Batra’s death was previously noted in 2003’s all-star LOC: Kargil, where he was played by Abhishek Bachchan, and he has clearly lodged in the Indian collective memory as a model citizen; a straight arrow willing to sacrifice all for the motherland. Yet that very straightness proves an issue in a two-hour battle charge of a film that shuttles its practically perfect protagonist (codename: Shershaah, or “King of Lions”) from playground fisticuffs to fateful last stand, while its idea of conflict never develops beyond the childishly superficial.For starters, this is the first time Batra has been played by someone who might pass for a model: Sidharth Malhotra, ever handsome, mostly upright, sensing he needn’t flex too hard to emerge looking like a sweetheart. As the film switches between Batra’s personal and professional lives, its star successfully runs the trickiest gauntlet: trying not to look too gawky in the shell suits of college flashbacks. Malhotra and an unusually deglammed Kiara Advani (as Batra’s beloved, Dimple) can’t credibly resemble undergraduates, but they share a fond, tender chemistry. It’s a pity Batra’s service leave keeps being interrupted by rumbles from Kashmir – but that’s where this story’s destiny lies.In the battle scenes, Tamil director Vishnuvardhan stages recces and shootouts with an unspectacular competence, and the most distinctive touch is applied by makeup: three stitches on Malhotra’s temple, so as not to obscure his features. The politics are far less delicate. This Batra begins as a diplomat (“If we don’t trust them, they’ll never trust us”) but the film makes him a warrior, throttling targets with their own headscarves. The avoidance of nuance should at least spare Johar any more of the violent campaigns he attracted after casting Pakistani actor Fawad Khan in 2016’s Ae Dil Hai Mushkil. His latest is nothing but patriotic, but it is also rote and uninspired, right through to the final-reel rallying cries and shots of the Indian flag fluttering unsullied in the wind. Shershaah is released on 12 August on Amazon Prime Video."
WeWork: Or the Making and Breaking of a $47 Billion Unicorn review – a startup too good to be true,"Adam Neumann’s vision of a communal, creative, snack hub-filled future comes crashing down in a fake-it-till-you-make-it fable",4,"Jed Rothstein’s very entertaining documentary is another horror story from the tulip-feverish world of tech startups: its subject is WeWork, co-founded in 2010 by the (allegedly) charismatic entrepreneur Adam Neumann – part CEO, part cult leader. His business model was basically really simple: renting out cubicle-style office space to creatives and freelancers in buildings in which he’d bought short leases on borrowed money. But these tenants got shared facilities such as groovy hangout areas, table football, coffee and snack hubs and the feeling that they were part of a vital experiment in communal creativity, a vision of a new interrelated future.Neumann waffled on like this endlessly, like Steve Jobs without an iPhone in his hand. The business took off, and the hype and the business journalism adoration took off, too. There were annual bacchanalian “summer camps” that WeWork laid on for its clients: “like Fyre festival gone right”, as someone puts it here. Neumann got a mind-bending multi-billion-dollar investment from credulous Japanese banker Masayoshi Son, which caused his megalomania to go over the edge, just as the business began to slide. Then in 2019 he made WeWork’s bizarre IPO (initial public offering), whose hippy-dippy prospectus was, in the words of one observer, like “a novel written by someone who’s shrooming”, and the emperor’s nudity was now impossible to ignore.Like Chris Smith’s Netflix documentary Fyre, films like this are beginning to develop a house style for their sheepish interviewees: the people who worked for the crooked company without blowing the whistle and the journalists who went along with it, suppressing their worries. It’s a kind of wry, amused, eyebrow-raised, gee-what-was-I-thinking approach, with a self-exculpatory emphasis on how wildly charismatic and hypnotic the boss was.Well, maybe all new businesses fake it till they make it, to some degree. I would have liked to hear more about Neumann’s partner and WeWork co-founder Miguel McKelvey (he is so absent I almost wondered if he had been giving some off-the-record guidance) and about Neumann’s formidable wife, Rebekah, who was the “chief brand and impact officer”. This was a workplace where they had a poster reading: “Punch today in the face.” It was the fired employees who felt that impact. WeWork: Or the Making and Breaking of a $47 Billion Unicorn is released on 13 August on digital platforms."
I’m Your Man review – Dan Stevens is the perfect date in android romance ,Near-future tale of a woman who accepts a male ‘companion’ robot played by  Stevens is laboriously told and not really funny enough,2,"Directed by Maria Schrader, this was a crowd-pleasing favourite at the Berlin film festival earlier this year and its star, Maren Eggert, won the festival’s new gender-neutral best leading performance prize. But I was disappointed with a film whose crises and dilemmas seem laborious and essentially predictable; it does not fully work as sci-fi or satire or comedy.We are in a world of the near-future (and the city of Berlin itself is certainly very plausible as its location). Eggert plays Alma, an archaeologist with an unhappy and frustrating personal life. She is persuaded by her boss to be a guinea-pig for a new hi-tech scheme: she will road-test a male “companion” robot, programmed to be infinitely considerate and obliging, which will attend to all her emotional and indeed physical needs. So Alma sceptically takes home this dashing humanoid geisha: Tom, played with elegant, fluent German by Dan Stevens. And after a rocky, angry start, after duly dismissing this soulless adventure in existential convenience, Alma inevitably comes to think that there could be something to it. In rejecting Tom, is she simply preferring the headache to the aspirin?Of course, the gender-switch Stepford Wives story has been tried before, in the gruesome 2004 Stepford Wives remake, and this resembles Matt Kane’s recent midlife satire Auggie and Alex Garland’s more thoughtful and ambitious Ex Machina from 2014. But really, the acting and script are pretty broad, which makes it difficult to take it seriously, and it is not fully successful as comedy. Sandra Hüller (from Toni Erdmann) is good as the corporate director whose job it is to place these robots with their new masters and mistresses, and she delivers a twist that in some ways makes her the most interesting character; I wondered if she would not have been better casting as Alma. I’m Your Man is released on 13 August in cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema."
Mission: Galaxy review – kids’ eco space odyssey wants to save the world,"While its goals are noble, uninspiring animation fails to ignite this sci-fi quest",2,"Mission: Galaxy opens on Planet Kepler, once a vibrant and fecund home for its inhabitants. A solemn voiceover recalls the tragic day when Earthers trespassed on this beautiful land and ended up exploiting its natural resources to destruction. It’s a heartrending start, but it’s a misguided decision to employ long expository narrative stops rather than letting world-building speak for itself. Presented as “Wall-E meets Avatar”, it has neither the emotional punch of the former nor the latter’s technical brilliance.The film’s central quest is certainly heroic. Axel, Jono and Gaga – a ragtag group of kids – are enthralled by the history of Kepler. Despite the protests of Papa Qi, Gaga’s father, who used to be an army general, the young ’uns set out to locate the callaro plant, a flower that doubles as a source of energy, now thought to be extinct. Along the way, the trio encounter baddies, discover unknown wonders, and find themselves in the midst of fierce battles.The animation, unfortunately, does not really measure up to the odyssey’s noble goals. There is an uninspiring flatness to the rugged, achingly barren land, and the insides of spaceships share the same nondescript glossy sheen. The songs that pop up occasionally are dull, too, particularly a sluggish singalong at a pub that feels like a slapdash afterthought. In fact, Mission Galaxy is the sequel to Axel: The Biggest Little Hero, which features the exact same protagonists and also centred on the pursuit of a rare plant. While the film might entertain very young kids, children deserve better than a basic repetition with very slight variations. Mission Galaxy is on digital platforms from 9 August."
Moonbound review – a mish-mash of folkloric hijinks as kids take trip to the moon,This German-Austrian animation aimed at younger children borrows from vaguely familiar sources,2,"Based on a well-known German book for children from 1915, this derivative but adequate animated feature fuses together an assortment of vaguely familiar characters and story tropes. The clever bit is that the film takes ideas from folklore and appears to be inspired by pre-existing intellectual property without infringing it.For instance, one of the characters that early-adolescent protagonist Pete (voiced by Aleks Le) meets on his way to the moon, where his sister has been taken prisoner, is the Sandman, a traditional figure in northern European mythology and popularised by ETA Hoffmann in the early 19th century. Later on, our heroes get to ride the backs of giant polar bears, remarkably similar to the ones in Philip Pullman’s His Dark Materials book series. Meanwhile, the humans’ guides also include beetles wistfully looking for abducted loved ones that seem to be mutant descendants of Disney’s Jiminy Cricket from Pinocchio and the creepy crawlies from A Bug’s Life.Younger children ought to be drawn to the saturated colours and the adventurous hijinks wherein the siblings learn to look out for each other and stand up to bullies. Pete’s little sister Anne (Lilian Gartner) has a very annoying voice and is dead ringer for Bonnie in Toy Story 3, but she’s an admirable enough role model for youngsters with her irrepressible optimism and belief in the fantastic. For accompanying adults’ amusement, there’s a winking reference to Spartacus two-thirds of the way in. Otherwise, the humour aims for the kids much more than older age groups. Moonbound is released on 6 August in cinemas."
The Fever review – dreamy film about a mysterious illness in Brazil,"Maya Da-Rin’s subtle, poetic debut engages with the hidden lives of the Desana people of Brazil",3,"Here is a mysterious and opaque movie, a feature debut from 42-year-old Brazilian artist and film-maker Maya Da-Rin. It does not give up its meaning easily, or perhaps at all. Newcomer Regis Myrupu won the best actor prize at the Locarno film festival for his understated performance as Justino, a member of the indigenous Desana people working as a security guard at a container port in Manaus harbour in northern Brazil. He is a widower, fussed over by his affectionate daughter Vanessa (Rosa Peixoto), who has just got into medical school at Brasília and will have to move away very soon and may not see her dad for many years. And perhaps that is what has caused a strange, profound unease in Justino. He suffers from a fever which is resistant to diagnosis. He becomes dreamy and inattentive at work and is called to see the stern head of human resources, who after some perfunctory inquiries about his mental health gives him a warning.But maybe his fever has a larger social or even cosmic origin. As an indigenous person, he is alienated from many in the city; a fellow security guard reveals himself to be bigoted towards “Indians”. The younger generation no longer hunt or fish the way Justino’s family once did; he jokingly says that his son has become enfeebled by eating supermarket food. But later, with a visible twinge, he will tell the doctor treating his fever that this is exactly what he himself eats. And the local community is disturbed by reports of a strange beast wandering about and killing animals. Could it be Justino’s restless spirit made flesh?The Fever is a calm and quiet and subtle film, a little inert perhaps, but deeply engaged with the hidden lives of Brazil’s indigenous people. There is poetry in it. The Fever is released on 6 August in cinemas."
Free Guy review – Ryan Reynolds bounces through fun videogame existential crisis,"A non-player character evolves into a sentient AI in a cheerfully silly riff on The Truman Show, with Taika Waititi and Jodie Comer",3,"The great big handsome-goofy face of Ryan Reynolds looms out of the screen in this fantasy comedy from screenwriter Matt Lieberman and director Shawn Levy (of the Night at the Museum franchise). It’s an undemanding and cheerfully silly riff on the themes of virtual reality and artificial intelligence, and what the heck we’re all doing in this big old universe of ours: as if someone took The Truman Show or Inception – or even The Lego Movie – and stripped out every serious satirical ambition, replacing it with M&M-coloured spectacle. The result is not something that’s in any way challenging, but Reynolds is so puppyishly eager to please.Reynolds plays a normal, boring guy whose name is Guy (amusingly, it is never clear if this is his actual given name, as in Guy Crouchback, or the more generic “guy”). He smiles incessantly, wears a bland, short-sleeved blue shirt and goes to work every day as a bank teller in a serenely marvellous-looking modern city, resembling Vancouver. There, he hangs out with his best friend, Buddy – again: generic or given name? – played by Lil Rel Howery, but his bank is always being hit by heists, which he greets with the same imperturbable smileyness. Gradually, Guy realises that he is an NPC, or non-player character, in a video game: a quirk or flaw in the algorithm means that he has hyperevolved into an AI state of free will and agency, able to question what is going on. This astonishes the game’s evil corporate owner Antoine (Taika Waititi), and also the designers Millie (Jodie Comer) and Keys (Joe Keery) whose concept Antoine ripped off. And Millie realises that she will have to enter the game as a player, befriend Guy and enlist his help in getting back their intellectual property – before, of course, falling in love with this clueless pixelated lunk.Perhaps Reynolds is the only possible casting here, as his boilerplate handsomeness is, with age, making him look more and more eerily generic. But he sells the daft concept efficiently enough, and his frowningly earnest grasp of his own utter insignificance in the scheme of things made me wonder what Reynolds would be like in a production of Tom Stoppard’s Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, maybe opposite Henry Cavill. There are some incidental laughs here, concerning the other players in the game, including a tough-guy avatar played by Channing Tatum, who is really, in the time-honoured style, a nerdy guy living in his mum’s basement.Another kind of movie would have made a bigger deal of Guy’s existential crisis, and tried to extract more from this both in terms of comedy and pathos. But Lieberman and Levy – perhaps refreshingly – just see it as a high-concept premise enabling a kind of doomed postmodern romance between Guy and Millie. Free Guy isn’t going to have many MA theses written about it, but it has entertainment value. Is the actual game going to be available as well? Free Guy is released on 12 August in Australia, and 13 August in the UK and US."
Limbo review – heart-rending portrait of refugees stranded in Scotland,Ben Sharrock announces himself as a master of atmospheric film-making with this stirring drama about a Syrian migrant,5,"What a thoroughly wonderful sophomore feature from the British director Ben Sharrock – witty, poignant, marvellously composed and shot, moving and even weirdly gripping. Despite an elegant deadpan style established from the outset, Sharrock soon gets you to invest in the characters and care deeply about what happens to them. Limbo is about refugees and asylum seekers in Britain, and it’s a bracingly internationalist and non-parochial piece of work: film-making with a bold view on the world but also as gentle and intimate as a much-loved sitcom. It reminded me at various moments of Aki Kaurismäki or Elia Suleiman or Bill Forsyth, with a distinct touch of Bruce Robinson’s Withnail And I.The setting is an impossibly bleak and starkly beautiful Scottish island, fictional and mostly deserted, almost resembling a stage-set for Waiting For Godot (but filmed partly on Uist in the Outer Hebrides). Here a number of refugees from Syria and elsewhere – single men with no families – have been relocated in grimly functional hostels with a bare-minimum subsistence allowance. Forbidden to do any paid work, they must simply wait for the official word on whether they can stay. And as the narrator says at the beginning of Casablanca: they wait … and wait … and wait. The situation is taken broadly from real life.There is Farhad (Vikash Bhai), who has come to Britain largely because he is a Freddie Mercury superfan, an essentially cheerful or at any rate stoic guy from Afghanistan. There is Abedi (Kwabena Ansah) and Wasef (Ola Orebiyi), brothers from Nigeria who are always quarrelling – once after viewing some Friends DVDs, about the issue of Ross believing himself to be “on a break” from dating Rachel, and then a serious falling out about the viability of Wasef’s dream of playing football for Chelsea.Most dramatically there is Omar – a hugely gentle and intelligent performance from Amir El-Masry – who has left Syria with his family. But his mum and dad are still in Turkey while Omar took the gamble on moving onward to try for residency in the UK. Meanwhile his brother has gone back to Syria – or never left in the first place – to fight Assad. Omar is stricken with repressed rage, guilt and doubt that he has amputated his Syrian identity to spend his days on this godforsaken island in the middle of nowhere. Omar is (or was) a brilliant musician, a soloist on the oud, a stringed instrument. He can’t play at the moment, supposedly because of a wrist injury, but this is just an excuse: he is creatively and spiritually blocked. El-Masry superbly conveys Omar’s fear that to play the oud under these wretched circumstances would be an act of futility and disloyalty. He carries his oud around in its case, as Farhad says, like a coffin for his soul.Sharrock superbly suggests the growing atmosphere of fear and anger that hovers like cloud cover: the men believe that they are deliberately kept in this stage of depression and desperation so that they will crack and ask to be sent home. Their contact with the state comes in the form of the drolly dramatised lectures they receive from two officials, Helga (Sidse Babett Knudsen) and Boris (Kenneth Collard), who tell them how to apply for menial jobs over the phone and the correct, respectful way to behave with women while dancing with them at a nightclub – a particularly bizarre instruction as these poor lonely men will never get near anything as exciting as that. Their inner lives are largely a closed book, although Farhad does let something slip about his life back home.The emotional centre of the film is Omar, and El-Masry’s tremendous performance – particularly in the heart-rending conversations he has with his mother over the phone, demanding detailed recipes in a doomed attempt to eat in exactly the way he ate back home. He treasures the design of his oud, the front of which is a stylised representation of their garden in Damascus. The scene in which he points all this out to Farhad is almost unbearably sad. This is superlative film-making from Sharrock. Limbo is released on 30 July in UK cinemas"
The Suicide Squad review – a slick meeting of sick minds,A convict task force dispense gleeful mayhem in this stylish reboot from a director with the perfect sewer aesthetic,4,"After one botched attempt to bring The Suicide Squad to the big screen, with the dourly competent David Ayer at the helm, this time DC Comics stumbled upon a more successful formula. The key: a director with a taste for anarchy, who crawled out of the same toxic sewer sludge as most of the characters. And in James Gunn, who cut his teeth working for gonzo shocksploitation production company Troma (Class of Nuke ’Em High, Tromeo and Juliet), they got just that.It’s a real meeting of sick minds, this revamp of the comic-book convict task force comprised of mutant sharks, killer clowns and the criminally insane. Gunn gleefully performs an initial bait and switch that is almost as unexpected as the Drew Barrymore cameo in Scream. The titles have barely rolled before the camera is drunkenly weaving like a bluebottle over the steaming entrails of characters we might have assumed were central to the story. Not to give too much away, but it pays not to get too attached to anyone. That said, Margot Robbie, returning as a perkily psychotic Harley Quinn, and Idris Elba, as literal killing machine Robert DuBois, are the ones you’d want on your side in a bar brawl.But the film’s main asset is Gunn’s imaginative vision: a fight scene is shot in reflection, distorted in the shiny helmet of Peacemaker (John Cena); two massive men grapple in an insalubrious urinal. The Suicide Squad has found its place in the superhero pantheon: the gutter, and proud."
Myth & Mogul: John DeLorean review – how years of lies felled an automotive giant,Netflix’s docuseries delves into how the king of the gull-winged car deceived his way to the top – then got arrested for a multimillion-dollar cocaine trafficking plot,3,"I didn’t realise the DeLorean was a real car until at least a decade after I first saw Back to the Future. In the 1985 Michael J Fox hit, it is (as we all know by cultural osmosis, even if we have never seen the film) the vehicle Doc uses for his time-travelling experiments that eventually take Marty back to 1955 and into a situation with his mother that has only become more “Jeepers creepers, what were you thinking?!” over the years. Anyway. The DeLorean – all sharp yet streamlined angles in futuristic stainless steel, with its gull-wing doors and a glamorous, retro-sounding name – was so right that it never crossed my mind it could be real.Much the same, it turns out, could be said of its inventor. For, of course, the car did exist, the brainchild of a gifted engineer who founded his own company to build this very machine. The new three-part Netflix documentary Myth & Mogul: John DeLorean traces his story with a level of detail that at times skates close to being exhausting as well as exhaustive, but manages to compel overall. If the man and his motives were never as brightly illumined as the facts of his story, it was not enough to spoil the eternal attraction of a classic rags to riches story – especially when it turns inexorably back to rags.The film moves back and forth in time (I am avoiding the obvious jokes – please send congratulations to the usual address) as various contributors, from DeLorean’s ex-wife to the investigative journalists who first sniffed the hint of corruption around him, piece the story together. His Detroit childhood was abusive (a plausible but surely simplistic explanation for his adult thralldom to making quick money floated later in the film), but DeLorean was an excellent student whose engineering designs were hung on the walls of the city’s Cass technical high school for everyone to admire.He went to work for Chrysler and then Packard, but made his name at General Motors, becoming famous within the industry for his engineering prowess, then for spotting a gap in the market for muscle cars and producing the Pontiac GTO. GM rewarded him by making him, at 40, the youngest ever vice-president at the company.From there, it seemed as though the world was his oyster. Rich, successful and – after a little cosmetic surgery – handsome, he took himself off to Hollywood and shucked off the conservatism of General Motors. He became a household name and began to enjoy a gilded life. In 1973, he founded the DeLorean Motor Company, found the British government willing to invest £80m in a car factory to bring jobs to impoverished, volatile west Belfast, nabbed Colin Chapman from Lotus and started production on his gull-winged dream. He had, he said, 30,000 orders to fill.He did not. Slightly too late in the film, we are introduced to DeLorean’s back catalogue – and far from all of it – of nefarious moneymaking schemes in pursuit of a fast buck, rather than the lucrative but long-term gains offered by his undoubted talent as an engineer. From his first minor scam in college to the purloining much later of a valuable patent from a fellow engineer who trusted him, all of his cons foreshadowed the coming implosion.Investigative journalists were picking up the scent of hubris. His nemesis came in the form of a secretary, Marian Gibson, who took company documents to the press to show that the Northern Ireland project was essentially a giant fraud. Things unravelled quickly thereafter, culminating in DeLorean’s arrest in an FBI sting operation for his part in a multimillion-dollar cocaine trafficking plot. The rich, famous, handsome white man, as no one who has lived in the world for long will be surprised to learn, was not convicted. On other charges – of defrauding investors and evading tax by siphoning off millions of company dollars into his pockets – he was also acquitted.There is nothing new or revelatory in this documentary, I suspect, to anyone with a working knowledge of DeLorean or his rise and fall. The overall story, and its ending, is one of the oldest in the world. But it bears retelling – and this is a stylish retelling, at least – if only because we don’t seem to be any closer to learning the story’s many lessons."
Vivo review – sweet but forgettable Netflix animation is Pixar-lite,Lin-Manuel Miranda voices a spunky kinkajou in a pleasant enough musical that feels like a patchwork of better kids’ films,3,"As part of Netflix’s recent quarterly update, the ever-expanding streamer bragged that this last year saw their biggest animated film to date, yet another sign of their all-conquering versatility. But despite a concerted effort to increase in-house animation, the movie in question was tellingly not one of their own creation but rather a Covid acquisition, made and primed by Sony for a big-screen release but panic-sold when cinemas shuttered.The Mitchells vs the Machines was a deserving chart-topper; funny and inventive and of a markedly different league than any of Netflix’s self-made cartoons. But its success came at a notable price, a stinging reminder that even their dedicated viewership can sniff out the real butter (a point underlined this summer by the reported success of Amazon’s sci-fi thriller The Tomorrow War which was bought from Paramount). Earlier this year Sony also decided to offload their summer adventure Vivo, with Netflix waiting with an open door and an open chequebook. In the wake of the Mitchells milestone, it launches with high expectations attached, expectations that edge further toward the sky with the involvement of Hamilton’s man wonder Lin-Manuel Miranda, stepping out of his Disney deal to grace Sony with his voice, songs and brand appeal.But while Vivo shares the expensive sheen and general good nature of Sony’s last hand-me-down, it falls short on just about everything else, a sweet and colourful musical adventure that isn’t quite sweet and colourful enough, coasting on simple pleasures that fade as soon as the music stops. While Mitchells was determined to blaze its own trail, Vivo is far more interested in cribbing from the Pixar playbook, especially in its opening stretch which tries its darndest to eke emotion out of the kind of eccentric set-up that we’ve come to know so well. It’s Havana, Cuba, and an elderly musician, Andrés (legendary Cuban musician Juan de Marcos González), performs in a local square with his trusty kinkajou, AKA honey bear, Vivo (Miranda). While Vivo’s sing-rap can be understood by us the viewers (even if at times we wish that weren’t the case), to the humans that surround him, all they hear is a squeak. But it’s a squeak with rhythm and the two make for an unusual yet effective pairing.When Andrés’s old singing partner Marta (Gloria Estefan) gets back in touch after years of silence offering him the chance to join her onstage at her final concert in Miami, he sees an opportunity: to finally confess the feelings he was never brave enough to when they were young in the form of a specially crafted love song. But tragedy strikes and Vivo has to make the trek by himself to honour his old friend for the last time.The opening combination of unusual dynamic and heart-grabbing tragedy, along with some dazzling animation, might be Pixar by numbers but Miranda’s earnest musical numbers edge us closer to old school Disney and as The Croods director Kirk DeMicco tries to coerce his film in the middle of a Venn diagram of both, he struggles to give it enough of its own personality. Like so many animated films, the narrative hinges on a manic quest (as Vivo heads to Miami with the help of an idiosyncratic young girl) but it’s not one that feels imaginative or exciting enough for us to get carried along with it. The locations are minimal, the stakes medium and the characters they meet along the way not quite amusing or distinctive enough. Even Vivo himself is just a standard-issue cute animal and Miranda’s energetic sing-rap mixed with his hand-on-heart show tunes is an acquired taste that would perhaps be easier to acquire if the songs themselves were that good (the final number, having been teased since the start, is frustratingly forgettable).The eye-popping gloss of Vivo will probably lure in impressive numbers for Netflix (the animation itself is generic but impressive) but in a genre that promises so much magic, the spell cast by Miranda and co is a brief one.Vivo is out in select cinemas on 30 July and on Netflix on 6 August"
The Garden Left Behind review – an unnerving snapshot of transphobic violence,"First-time actor Carlie Guevara is radiant as Tina, an undocumented Mexican trans woman building her life in New York, in an otherwise unsettling film",3,"Attacks on transgender people are rising so fast in the US that campaigners talk of an “epidemic” of violence. Victims are disproportionately Black or Latina – like Tina (Carlie Guevara), the sweet-natured Mexican trans woman at the centre of this New York indie. I was desperate for the movie to end happily but, from the opening scene, director Flavio Alves foreshadows the violence to come, beginning with a menacing closeup of a man’s face, nostrils flaring, mouth pinched with hate as he watches her walking home.It’s not reasonable to ask that the film keeps Tina safe, but a sense from the start that things might end badly for her made me wince a little even during the lovely, authentic-feeling scenes of her life. Alves cast the film from within the trans community, and first-time actor Guevara’s performance as Tina has a radiant quality, soulful and touchingly gentle, though her line readings are a little stilted at times. Tina is an undocumented worker who has been in New York since the age of five. She lives with her elderly grandma, who can’t wrap her head around Tina’s identity (she still uses male pronouns); but their apartment is filled with love and food. Tina drives a cab and is saving up for gender reassignment. When a friend is attacked, she joins a grassroots Trans Lives Matter campaign.Tina barely notices the stoned-looking long-haired loner working behind the counter at the local grocery shop, Chris (Anthony Abdo); he stares at her with a frightening mix of desire and disgust. I wasn’t absolutely sure if the film needed to spend so much time on his seething self-loathing: pumping weights, masturbating in the shower, humiliated by his macho semi-mates for being odd and unconfident. His destructive shame, for me, threatened to eclipse this moving realistic-feeling portrait of a woman building her life. The Garden Left Behind is released on 23 July on digital platforms."
A Day for Susana review – Paralympic swimmer’s remarkable resilience in adversity,"Following Brazilian swimmer Susan Schnarndorf’s road to the 2016 Games, we see the athlete’s willingness to deal with the impact of multiple system atrophy",3,"Here is a film that accomplishes the difficult task of capturing the heroic trials of its subject without overly valorising and mythologising the real person. It is reminiscent of the excellent Time Trial documentary about cyclist David Millar, which ruminated on the turmoil that comes with the waning power of a once exceptional athlete’s body. Here, the struggle is even more heartbreaking, as the film recounts the road to the 2016 summer Paralympics of Brazilian swimmer Susana Schnarndorf, a six-time Ironman Triathlon winner who now suffers from multiple system atrophy (MSA), a rare neurological disorder.Though dealing with a terminal illness, A Day for Susana has a matter-of-fact, fly-on-the-wall approach as it calmly chronicles the two years leading up to the Paralympics where Schnarndorf competed in numerous championships. As MSA affects the human body slowly, causing autonomic and mobility impairments, it proves exceptionally difficult for the 48-year-old Schnarndorf to not only train but to pick the right category to compete in – these latter are divided according to the severity of the disability. As a result, her individual race times change drastically from one year to another.In the face of such difficulties, Schnarndorf proves to be an especially compelling subject as the film alternates between the heaviness of her losses and the lightness with which she sometimes jokes about the condition. The helplessness that Schnarndorf feels about her body is also mirrored in her relationship to her oldest son, from whom she becomes estranged partly due to the rigorous sport. Swimming emerges here as the one constant that anchors her life. The makers have take an ill-conceived decision to colour-grade the film’s middle section in a uniform shade of grey; even if the intention is to reflect Schnarndorf’s reverses, the footage merely looks blurry and difficult to see.

Bye Bye Morons review – Gallic absurdity lost in translation,This comedy about unlikely allies on the run was a hit in France at least,2,"A terminally ill woman in search of the baby she gave up at birth, a man whose botched suicide has placed him on a wanted list and an archivist whose blindness is no barrier to his gallantry join forces on the run from the police. This box-office hit from France wears its quirky absurdity lightly, despite a dedication to the late Python Terry Jones, and a fleeting cameo from Terry Gilliam.That said, many of the verbal jokes – a running gag about mispronounced names, for example – might not translate particularly well to anglophone ears. It’s amiable enough, but this broad French comedy is not distinctive enough for the arthouse crowd, and too Gallic for the mainstream."
Off the Rails review – a new low for British comedy,Three middle-aged women go Interrailing in an ash-scattering own-goal for European diplomacy,1,"A dire British misfire about three fiftysomething friends who embark on an Interrailing trip in memory of their dead buddy, Off the Rails is cringingly dreadful stuff even by the low standards of the ash-scattering dramedy road trip subgenre. Bickering middle-aged women obsessing over travel arrangements is not entertainment, it’s a living hell. On no account should this be shown to the rest of Europe or else they’ll just concrete over the end of the Channel tunnel and have done with us."
Kandisha review – feminist horror gets postcolonial on men’s asses,Three Parisian female graffiti writers summon a vengeful succubus in a movie that draws inspiration equally from Candyman and Moroccan fireside folklore,3,"Western nations have been slow to use cinema to confront the modern-day legacy of colonialism – but perhaps France’s especially acrimonious decolonisation means the ripples are felt more violently in that country’s films than most. After the invisible threat in Michael Haneke’s Hidden, and the somnambulist sway of 2019’s Zombi Child, the French postcolonial movie goes all the way to full horror in this raw but forceful banlieue-set film which draws equal inspiration from Candyman and Moroccan fireside folklore.Nicking the “black-blanc-beur” (black-white-north African) setup of La Haine, the protagonists are Amélie (Mathilde Lamusse), Bintou (Suzy Bemba) and Morjana (Samarcande Saadi) – three girl graffiti artists who live in a Paris estate and convene in a lofty, derelict block to smoke gear, dance to trap and tag walls. After Amélie escapes a rape attempt by her ex, she draws a pentagram in her own blood on her bathroom tiles and invokes Aisha Kandisha, a demonic mythological figure from Morocco whose name the trio uncovered in the tower block.This bogeywoman, initially seen lurking in full black burqa and tasselled headpiece, operates a male-only vengeance policy. But beyond that requirement, she seems a bit indiscriminate; to the girls’ horror, Aisha Kandisha is happy to vent on any man in their entourage. The out-of-line ex is first on the chopping block, but her modus operandi isn’t really clarified by the initial couple of deaths, staged rather abruptly and haphazardly by directors Alexandre Bustillo and Julien Maury. Nor does the preamble establish misogyny, beyond the rape, as a daily enough concern to make Kandisha strike a true feminist chord.But, as Bustillo and Maury prowl the housing projects under oppressive skies and on disorientating tilts, the colonialist undercurrents start to sing. The clues are there: in life, Aisha Kandisha was apparently a Moroccan aristocrat who resisted Portuguese occupation. And as the consequences close in on the white girl Amélie, the surprisingly strong racial rancour in much of the early banter starts to seem like a festering wound we should have noticed. The closing stretch – including an exorcism in an imam’s incantation-lined apartment (interior design goals!) – is brutally effective. By this time, Aisha Kandisha is a towering succubus; postcolonial theory stomping in on a pair of terrifying goat’s hooves. Kandisha is available on Shudder on 22 July."
Every Breath You Take review – Casey Affleck fires blanks in trashy psychodrama,The Oscar-winner gives a sluggish performance as a grief-stricken psychiatrist in this shallow psychological thriller,2,"In Manchester By the Sea, Casey Affleck gave a heart-rending performance as a father emotionally paralysed by the death of his young children; at times barely moving his features, he suggested the rage and grief swelling inside his character. Well, here he is again, grief stricken and blank-faced, playing a psychiatrist whose son has been killed in a car crash. The trouble is this time it’s impossible to read anything much into Affleck’s sleepy eyes – other than possibly an overwhelming urge to take a nap. His sluggish performance suits the tempo of this shallow psychological thriller, which is written in the style of a 90s potboiler but as if someone forgot to switch on the gas. It’s gloomy and dull, and a little bit up itself.There’s a snortingly ridiculous scene near the start where psychiatrist Philip (Affleck) presents a case study to an auditorium full of students. He claims to have cured a young suicidal woman called Daphne (Emily Alyn Lynd) with an experimental new talking therapy; ignoring all the usual boundaries, he has shared his own grief and emotional trauma with her – telling her things he hasn’t even confided to his wife Grace (Michelle Monaghan). When his boss at the psychiatric institute raises a sceptical eyebrow, Philip defends his approach with what passes for intellectual rigour. Actually, with a bored sigh he says: “You’re so old school.”Trouble begins when Daphne kills herself and her brother James (Sam Claflin) shows up; he’s not blaming Philip at all, but his razor cheekbones and cut-glass English accent are a dead giveaway that he is the movie’s bunny boiler. He seduces Philip’s rebellious daughter (India Eisley); then extends the hand of friendship – so to speak – to wife Grace. Claflin’s scenery-chomping performance does raise the temperature a degree or two, and gives the movie a juicy B-movie tang. But the whole thing hangs on a twist that anyone who has ever watched a trashy thriller will have cottoned on to at around the 20-minute mark. Every Breath You Take is released on 23 July on Sky Cinema and NOW TV.In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

Reset review – beautiful footage of extreme-sports thrill-seekers,"French director Thierry Donard, ‘the Fellini of adventure film-making’, shoots four sets of daredevils throwing themselves headlong into intense experience",3,"Here’s an extreme sports documentary from Thierry Donard, who on account of his stunning photography has apparently been dubbed “the Fellini of adventure film-making”. True to his reputation, Reset combines some astonishingly beautiful images with guts-in-your-mouth thrilling sequences – though a bit more explanation would be helpful for viewers unfamiliar with the four sports featured.Take speedflying, which looks a like super-fast, super-dangerous form of paragliding. The film follows a pair of shaggy-haired barefoot dudes, Jamie Lee and Malachi Templeton from New Zealand, as they take a running jump off Mont Blanc strapped to tiny paragliders which, to the untrained eye, look like glorified umbrellas. The pair hurtle down the mountain, inches above the rocks, whooping with the intoxicating, hedonistic thrill of it. Afterwards, Lee shrugs off the risk of death with a zen smile: “If that’s the way my body leaves this vessel …”The most terrifying footage here is of a Norwegian duo, snowboarder Krister Kopala and skier Nikolai Schirmer, who climb mountains with ice axes and ropes. It takes up to 10 hours to reach the summit; the pair then kamikaze down in two, maybe three minutes, speeding at up to 100km/h along couloirs, narrow little ravines filled with snow and rocky ice. Donard films one descent from across the range, following a distant figure in black curving gracefully down the mountainside: it could be a scene from a Bond movie. Reset also features freediver Davide Carrera and hypnotic footage of surfers in Tahiti.Irritatingly, Donard tacks on a bland eco message, when French actor Vincent Cassel gives a short narration at either end, spinning a nothing-y, shallow line about how we can all learn something about living simply and close to nature. Actually, don’t these globetrotters experience the same the guilt and conflict many of us have when flying on planet-destroying airplanes to get closer to nature? I would be far more interested in grilling these daredevils about what it is that takes them so far outside ordinary experience and so close to the abyss. Reset is released on 21 July in cinemas for one night only."
Phil Liggett: The Voice of Cycling review – Tour de France stalwart meanders off route,"Narrator of key moments in cycling since the mid-70s, Liggett’s story includes his controversial support of Lance Armstrong",3,"Here is a documentary of pretty niche interest, it has to be said: the life and times of Tour de France commentator Phil Liggett, who was a ubiquitous fixture on TV coverage of the event in English-speaking countries for years. Well, Liggett appears to be an interesting character, if John Craven looked a bit like Terence Stamp and held forth with a touch of Alan Partridge, but with a runtime of a shade under two hours, this is pushing it a bit.Born on the Wirral, and currently residing with his wife Trish in a game reserve in South Africa where he helps with efforts to protect rhinos from poachers, Liggett is one of those old-school sports broadcasters – like John Motson or Clive Everton – whose natural communication skills and unswerving celebration of their discipline have inserted themselves into the minds of generations of TV audiences though sheer familiarity. This profile is at its most entertaining when describing Liggett’s early journey from highly rated amateur racer into sports journalism, and then to TV commentary in the mid-70s – Liggett says he was so unnerved by a phone call from legendary silver-fox World of Sport presenter Dickie Davies that he forgot to start commenting on his first live transmission.Rather generously, this film gives Liggett space to hold court at some length on his rhino-conservation activities – perhaps as a counterweight to the one major blot on Liggett’s CV: his fulsome support of disgraced racer Lance Armstrong, even as everyone else had concluded that Armstrong had cheated. Directors Nickolas Bird and Eleanor Sharpe don’t avert their eyes, even including Liggett’s ill-advised rant against US anti-doping agency Usada, but it’s not allowed to interrupt the celebratory mood for too long. We end up going down quite a few byways – such as Liggett phlegmatically waiting in his car while Trish, a former Olympic level speed skater, gets in a bit of competitive ballroom dancing – which perhaps are not entirely necessary. Still, this film (and Liggett) is likable and charming enough. Phil Liggett: The Voice of Cycling is released on 26 July in cinemas."
Casablanca Beats review – Morocco’s answer to Fame strikes a chord,A group of talented teens push the boundaries of their religious society by putting on a concert in Nabil Ayouch’s earnest film,3,"Franco-Moroccan director Nabil Ayouch has made a likable, high-energy youth movie that could almost be called the Moroccan answer to Fame and which features that time-honoured plot device: putting on a concert.Using nonprofessionals playing docu-fictionalised versions of themselves, Ayouch has created a drama revolving around an arts centre for young people that he himself helped to set up in the tough district of Sidi Moumen, called by someone here the Bronx of Casablanca. The school includes a special programme called the Positive School of Hip-Hop. A crowd of smart, talented teens join the class and we watch as they find out the challenges, limits and opportunities of learning self-expression through western-style rap in a Muslim society.Anas (Anas Basbousi) is a twentysomething rapper who has come to teach at the school – perhaps in retreat from some personal or professional crisis – and immediately comes into conflict with the arts centre authorities who won’t let him spray-paint the classroom with his own designs. We see repeated scenes of lonely Anas away from the school, petting and befriending a dog. Has he no human friends? And he gets off to what looks like an unfortunate start with the students themselves: he asks them to perform some rhymes, which they shyly do, to the polite and supportive approbation of the rest of the class, but he himself tears each person to shreds, saying their lyrics are vacuous.Is Anas supposed to be quite so obnoxious? I have to say it’s not entirely clear from his performance. But soon students and teacher warm to each other, performing a lot of new material that Anas really likes. But there are flash points: acrimonious discussion about whether they should rap about religion (the unstated conclusion seems to be no) and politics. And when some of the women in the class joyfully find that rap gives them an expressive force undreamed of in the rest of their lives, some of the young men – otherwise fully enthusiastic about swaggeringly sexualised rap for men – start telling them that if they dress and behave demurely, they will not be abused. Some of the kids have awful home lives and some parents show up at the school, outraged at the teaching of shameless singing and dancing. Ayouch creates stylised musical scenes where the kids break into rap during their real lives. And it all builds up to their controversial concert.It is all presented earnestly and engagingly, though self consciously, and if the political debates are unsolved, well, that could be because they are unsolved in real life. It’s certainly a heartening demonstration that new ideas can flourish in a religious society. Casablanca Beats screened at the Cannes film festival, and is released on 29 April in cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema."
Fear Street Part 3: 1666 review – hokey horror trilogy ends on a high,Netflix’s big-bet slasher franchise goes back in time before leaping forward again in a rousing and immensely satisfying finale,4,"We’ve come to the end of Netflix’s surprisingly satiating summer of Fear Street, a three-week horror event that’s surpassed admittedly subterranean expectations. Based on teen fiction god RL Stine’s sprawling set of books, the trilogy has taken us from 1994 with a riff on Scream to 1978 with a play on Friday the 13th and now back to 1666 for a take on … well, what exactly?Director Leigh Janiak has said that her main visual inspiration for the threequel was the rotten beauty of The New World, but that’s where the Terrence Malick comparisons start and end (his films have been frustratingly light on both eye-gouging and Oasis needle-drops) and instead, rather than being tied to a specific source of inspiration, 1666 is a bit of everything. It’s The Crucible meets The Witch meets It meets It Follows meets the trilogy’s ultimate overarching influence Scooby-Doo. Again, like the two films that came before, it’s something that skirts very close to being a disaster, but Janiak exerts total tonal control, knowing when to wink and when to keep a straight face, making this chapter just as effective, a rousing finale to a winning new franchise.As we left the events of 1978, we were yanked back to 1994 as Deena (Kiana Madeira) and her brother Josh (Benjamin Flores Jr) tried to put an end to the curse once and for all. But in trying to reassemble the body of Sarah Fier, the witch whose curse has resulted in gory massacres for the beleaguered town of Shadyside, Deena is yanked back even further, to where it all began: 1666. She becomes Fier, reliving her final days as a forbidden romance with a local girl leads to accusations of witchcraft and the answer to the mystery that’s taken centuries to solve.It takes a little bit longer third time around for Fear Street to find its groove, this particular period setting not as much of an obvious or comfortable fit for Stine and Janiak, at least initially. The decision to populate 1666 with faces from previous chapters is both welcome (it allows us more time with some of the talented actors, and fan favourites, who died too fast and too soon) and jarring (there are a lot of … accent choices) and while the downbeat darkness of 1978 certainly put a dampener on the first film’s nostalgic neon flash, there’s even less room for fun here. The grimness of the setting, and the predicament that Fier finds herself in (one that has loosely believable roots in reality), requires a stony face both from the characters and from us, a transition that takes time to take hold in a franchise that has mostly embraced hokeyness. But Janiak soon finds her stride, choreographing some memorable nastiness as well as a sad emotional sting before we head back to the full-throated 90s.The second half of the film is a blast, ebulliently returning to the goofy conviction and high energy of the first chapter with a crowd-pleasing mall-set climax. The buildup, over two films and 300 years, brings with it the weight of generational trauma, of what Shadysiders have endured for so long, tragedies that have haunted them and the image of the town, and the twisty specifics of why this has been happening allow for a surprisingly powerful showdown. The Fear Street trilogy has refreshingly avoided much subtext – they’re horror films too busy trying to entertain us to really be about something else – but the lightly etched throughline of lower-class status being a curse is well-highlighted in the finale without being overly underlined, and the earnestness that Janiak has fostered means that even a “let’s go save the day” speech comes off as affecting rather than affected.The acting is again a major sell, from the charming brother-sister duo of Madeira and Flores Jr to an expanded role for Gillian Jacobs, giving strong Laurie Strode vibes, to Darrell Britt-Gibson perfecting the impossible: non-annoying slasher comic support. The unwavering energy of the cast makes it impossible not to jump onboard their gussied-up Mystery Machine and while many key lessons will be learned from the trilogy’s success, thoughtful casting will surely be up near the top.It’s the end of the road for now but I’d bet on a swift return to Fear Street some time soon (make sure you watch those credits …). Janiak has found a way to add new life to old material, gifting us with the rare horror franchise that makes us want more rather than less, the prospect of an expanded universe seeming less like a curse and more of a blessing.Fear Street Part 3: 1666 is now available on Netflix"
Plurality review – gruesome but simple-minded multiple-identity thriller,"This Taiwanese sci-fi about an investigation in which the suspects’ minds are injected into a host body starts promisingly, but quickly ditches any complexity",2,"Dabbling in a myriad of already weary tropes first pioneered by The Matrix trilogy, this Taiwanese sci-fi crime thriller Plurality could have put a fresh twist on big-budget Hollywood efforts, but falls flat on both the production design and the narrative front.The young son of a city councillor is the latest victim in a string of kidnappings targeting children with disabilities or facial disfigurements, and the police become convinced that the perpetrator is one of the five passengers who have died in a mysterious bus crash. Thanks to a new technology, they are able to use the vegetative body of a criminal on death row into which to inject the brain fluids of the suspects. (These include a shady businessman, a spoiled dropout, a reticent college student, a father estranged from his daughter, and the bus driver.) As the police try to extract information from these evasive subjects, the more gruelling the interrogation becomes, the more violently the five identities wrestle for control of their corporeal host, which leads to explosive revelations and bloodshed.The device of multiple identities within one body has a clear similarity to M Night Shyamalan’s controversial Split, but Plurality lacks the same commitment to character-building; and it doesn’t help that the film appears to be crafted around random twists rather than emotional motivation. The tension between ruthless Detective Wang (Frederick Lee) and haunted scientist Dr Shen (Sandrine Pinna) – whose own son is also abducted – is interestingly explored in the first couple of scenes, yet the film quickly ditches such promising complexity for action and chase sequences. The attempt to capture the maze-like mindscape of the prisoner, full of different personalities roaming about, is similarly anaemic with its poorly conceived design. Plurality might spiral in increasingly ludicrous directions, but the result is decidedly one-dimensional. Plurality is released on 19 July on digital platforms."
Boarders review – philosophical skateboard hopefuls offer some nice moves,An unexpectedly reflective film charts the skateboarders’ chaotic buildup to the Tokyo games and captures their eclectic personalities,3,"Skateboarding makes its debut at the Olympics in Tokyo next week, and Sean Fee and Annika Ranin’s unexpectedly reflective film documents the preparations of Team GB’s riders. As if in answer to the debate about whether this gnarlier-than-thou lifestyle should be given the appellation of “sport”, let alone if it belongs at the most official of sporting forums, the British preparations seem almost laughably on-the-fly. The team members and manager complain about the stingy funding. At the time of filming they don’t have the funky livery rocked by their rivals and – surprisingly given skating’s immense presence on UK streets – they struggle to find the facilities needed to hone the manoeuvres they will need to win medals.The candidness extends into a fairly intimate portrayal of the personalities who, a bit stunned, find themselves in the position of being national representatives. There’s Sam Beckett, the most ostensibly successful one, who rode the sponsorship gravy train in the US but now, nearly 30, seems slightly lost. Alex Hallford, a lanky Nottingham homebody with a string of Nepalese bunting in his living room, is unimpressed by the subtleties of Olympic scoring. Jordan Thackeray is a barrelling, athletic presence in a skate bowl, but hits the banjo to wind down. And Alex Decunha, a teetotaller whose quick-fire tricks look like an extension of his fastidious personal style, hints at the pro-athlete future for skateboarding many fear the Olympics are ushering in.Flipping between the team buildup, a potted history of British skateboarding and assorted personal musings, Boarders is baggily structured, and feels overlong as a result. But it’s still an absorbing look at day-to-day involvement in a sport that’s a combination of dynamism and hyper-precision as an activity, but paradoxically nebulous and uncertain as a long-term career. A sense of drift is further spotlighted when the pandemic postpones the Tokyo games. Hallford’s relationship falls apart, he decides to live in a van, and suffers a horrific injury making a sketchy essay of a canal lock embankment that is surely the opposite of whatever sensible athletic training looks like. But this film misses a trick in not taking more than a token look at British female skaters – especially as two have now joined the Olympic team. Boarders is available on Bohemia Euphoria on 15 July."
Knightriders: young Ed Harris leads an outcast kingdom of role-playing medieval bikers ,"George A Romero’s sprawling, overlooked 1981 film has an outrageous setup but never punches down",0,"Knightriders is streaming in Australia on Stan. For more recommendations of what to stream in Australia, click hereWith golden hair catching the light, a young Ed Harris rises with a lithe damsel from a bed of ferns. He flagellates himself in a river before kneeling in prayer, naked, grasping the hilt of a mighty broadsword. Now, clothed in an impressive suit of armour, Harris mounts his trusty steed. The beast growls to life, its engine rumbles and its two wheels spin – hang on a minute, they didn’t have motorbikes in the middle ages. And is that Stephen King in a trucker hat, heckling from the front row, while eating a giant sandwich?Harris is playing Billy, the “King” of a troupe of petrol-head LARPing (that’s live action role-playing) enthusiasts, in George A Romero’s Knightriders – the 1981 follow-up to the director’s genius, zombie-filled social satire, Dawn of the Dead. Billy’s Camelot makes money by moving town to town, performing stunt shows and selling handmade crafts. But his kingdom isn’t just about playing dress-ups; he wants to create a new society for the drifters, lost souls and people the world leaves behind.The set up is outrageous, but Romero’s sprawling, overlooked film is really a loving, complicated examination of the difficulties of living a life at odds with the status quo. It shows how communities existing on society’s fringes, like artists and performers, are often at the forefront of creating a better and more equitable future; and are a haven for people the world at large has failed to make space for.Knightriders doesn’t punch down and avoids stereotyping its cast of outsiders. The troupe’s town crier Pippin is queer but not camp; its mechanic Angie might be a grease monkey, but isn’t painted as a butch tomboy; and its hyper-masculine heroes are often sensitive or flawed.The only caricatures in the film exist outside Billy’s kingdom: hangers on, neo-Nazis and corrupt sheriffs; or the sleazy manager and condescending TV executive who see the troupe as a kind of freak show to be put on display, ridiculed and profited from. They either fail to understand or simply don’t care about Billy’s noble mission. It’s a position many artists find themselves in. Kept at arm’s length by society for their otherness, while simultaneously exploited for their talents.Knightriders excels at showing how people that choose an artistic life often do so out of compulsion, as a necessity of existence. Which isn’t to say creative people don’t wish for success or value their work, but they often can’t fight the need to create in the same way a plumber can resist laying pipes for free (no diss to plumbers here). It’s not as simple as clocking on and clocking off. When your emotions and dreams are the materials of your work, it can be hard to separate labour from life. Art and commerce are uneasy bedfellows.At one point, Knightriders’ troupe splits as some members become frustrated with Billy’s relentless code of ethics, and follow the lure of fame. Meanwhile Billy refuses to relent – growing increasingly isolated and mad in the process – and hurts both himself and the people who care for him. The work of people like Billy may create joy, but it’s nonetheless a deeply serious undertaking in which compromise can seem impossible – and for which they’re willing to put their own bodies on the line.During one scene, the audience dances and hollers on the sidelines, completely drawn into the spectacle conjured by the troupe, who battle themselves bloody in axe-wielding chariot duels. The performers are like dancers who’ve irreparably contorted their bodies to share their sublime movement with us, or the professional wrestlers who’ve pumped themselves full of steroids to carry us to the top of Mount Olympus.Many artists struggle to juggle the passion, vision and ambition required to conceive previously unknown worlds against the realities of the real one in which we live. Knightriders is a reminder that for the people and communities who create the things that make life worth living, the imaginary worlds they let us inhabit momentarily are often, for them, very much real. But if we give them enough support, their utopias can permanently alter our reality too."
A Hero review – Asghar Farhadi’s realist tale is just too messy and unsatisfactory,Plot holes trip up the Iranian director’s drama of a slippery man’s desperate efforts to trick his way out of debtors’ prison,3,"Asghar Farhadi has made a tangled film about the tangled web we weave when first we practise to deceive, in that calmly observant, realist yet information-withholding style with which this director made his name. In way, A Hero is a slice-of-life story, in which the “i”s and the “t”s are not necessarily dotted and crossed like a regular screenplay; it has the unsatisfactory, unclear messiness that real life has. There is plenty of interest here - and yet I have to admit to slight reservations about the melodramatic contrivances, which stretch credulity a little.A Hero is a film that works because of a clever and subtle performance from Amir Jadidi as Rahim, a divorced father who has just been released from jail on a two-day parole, having been imprisoned for debt. He is a man with a bright yet strange, desperate smile, like one of the poor relations in Dickens. He is looking forward to being reunited with his girlfriend, his supportive sister and his beloved son – a gentle, sensitive boy with a speech impediment. Rahim is a man who believes that some sort of charming niceness might still get him get out of a jam. But he has a very specific plan for cancelling his prison sentence. His girlfriend has found a handbag in the street containing what appear to be gold coins: if they could sell them to a gold dealer, might that not raise enough for a deposit to persuade his creditor to forgive the debt?But when the coins prove to be worth less than they thought, Rahim muddles his way towards a new plan: why not put up notices around the streets announcing a found bag and get good publicity for being a heartbreakingly honest guy, a reformed lawbreaker who passed up the chance for easy money? The bag’s owner gratefully contacts Rahim’s sister, and the prison authorities themselves publicise Rahim’s good-guy routine, eager themselves for good publicity after an ugly suicide at the jail. Rahim gives a TV news interview in which he claims that it was he who providentially found the bag, and a charitable foundation is moved to raise money for this new hero of selflessness. And Rahim does not hesitate to use his poor, stammering son to garner sympathy from the public.But his creditor, a family friend, is deeply irritated by Rahim’s pass-agg, saintly new image, especially as he himself was nearly ruined by Rahim’s slippery business practices. And then a sceptical public official, from whom Rahim is expecting employment as part of his jail release scheme, demands proof that the lady who lost the bag even exists. And when Rahim can’t find her, he wheedlingly persuades his girlfriend to pose as this woman. Moreover, as his imposture unravels, the increasingly dismayed charity gives the money instead to the wife of a condemned man (to get his death sentence commuted) and Rahim has the cheek to claim that this too was his own, heroically selfless idea.It’s an ingenious high-concept premise, like a literary short story. Yet the plot holes are obvious from the outset. Nobody asks Rahim the obvious question: if he wanted to be a good citizen, why did he not simply hand the found bag in at a police station? Putting up flyers was a clearly inefficient and self-serving idea. We don’t see Rahim’s ex-wife, although custody and visiting arrangements with their son must surely be an issue.There are two alarming and chaotic fights in the film – scuffles rather – and the narrative is eventually to turn on that contemporary yet convenient device: the covert mobile-phone video, with which Rahim appears to be blackmailed, but which is then shared on social media to facilitate another plot move. A Hero is an engaging and even intriguing film, but I wonder if its realist mannerisms are concealing a slightly unfocused story. A Hero screened at the Cannes film festival and is released on 7 January in the UK in cinemas, and on 21 January on Amazon Prime Video."
Werewolves Within review – witty horror whodunnit gets away with murder,"The hoariest of horror premises, a secret werewolf killing the townsfolk one by one, is pulled off with surgical comic skill",4,"This goofy horror comedy, based on an online game of the same name, just goes to prove that if you have a great cast, smart direction and witty script you can just about get away with murder. Or at least with pulling off the hoariest of horror premises, a whodunnit where one of the characters is a secret werewolf killing the others one by one.Cuddly wimp Finn Wheeler (Sam Richardson, best known probably for a minor but indelible role in Veep) arrives in a one-street rural burg in New England to take up a post as the new forest ranger. He’s shown around town and introduced to the residents by perky ace axe-thrower and local mailperson Cecily (Milana Vayntrub). It soon becomes clear that, like so many exurban communities in that region, the small population is half made up of red-state holdouts such as local craft-store owner Trisha (Michaela Watkins, glorious) and her maple-syrup-harvesting husband Pete (Michael Chernus), and half of hipster incomers from the coasts, enjoying how far their wealth goes in the sticks, like gay couple Joaquim (Harvey Guillén from the TV series What We Do in the Shadows) and Devon (Cheyenne Jackson) who make a fortune in tech. As if lifestyle choices and who voted for whom in the last two elections isn’t enough to set the two factions squabbling, there’s an energy executive (Wayne Duvall) in town trying to get people to agree to let a pipeline go through their land.All that socio-political stuff is definitely there but only as an underlying bassline while the main melody of the film is the gradual picking off of the characters in comically grisly fashion during a snowstorm one night when everyone happens to be at hotel owner Jeanine’s (Catherine Curtin) big spooky house. The ensemble ratchets up the hysteria with surgical comic skill, orchestrated superbly by Josh Ruben’s sharp direction. Even the obligatory transformation scene, without which no werewolf movie is complete, is a gigglefest. Werewolves Within is released on 19 July on digital platforms and DVD."
Finding You review – sex-free teen romance for Twilight generation,Wholesome young stars – and Vanessa Redgrave – do their best with this anodyne Irish-set love story,2,"Although the main characters in this romantic tale are meant to be just over 18, this Sky Movies release is manifestly aimed at a much younger market with its sex-free storyline and nice-girls-finish-first morality. Sure, the plot is as corny as Cracker Jack, revolving as it does around wholesome blond normcore kid Finley (Rose Reid), an aspiring violinist, who arrives in rural Ireland from New York to do a semester abroad and falls in love with non-threateningly baby-faced movie star Beckett (Jedidiah Goodacre).But the film-makers have taken pains to gussy it up with a few contemporary details. For example, Beckett (who, like all the American characters, inexplicably has a last name for a first name) is in Ireland to work on a Game of Thrones-style fantasy movie series. Meanwhile Finley, compelled by her Irish Studies teacher to mingle with a local elder, reads the Twilight novels to her assigned crotchety old biddy Cathleen (Vanessa Redgrave, no less). Both references thus allow the film to namecheck other romantic texts that this demographic loves – and sort of laugh at them at the same time.While on the whole unbelievably cheery and starry-eyed about Ireland, right down to the local homeless drunk (Patrick Bergin) being a crack fiddle player who teaches Finley to play from the heart, there are a few nods to the harsher realities of life. It turns out that Cathleen, treated as a pariah by the whole town because she allegedly stole her sister’s sweetheart and married him, was really trying to save her sibling from an abusive marriage by sacrificing herself. (Perhaps that’s meant to be a period-accurate act of masochism?) Mirroring that, Beckett’s manager-father Montgomery (Tom Everett Scott) is eventually unmasked for exploiting his kid’s talent and fame for his own profit.But those tiny specks of grit get entirely smoothed over in pearlescent sentimentality by the end, eased through by lashings of flute-and-fiddle noodlings on the soundtrack. Finding You is available on Sky Cinema and Now TV."
Flag Day review – Sean Penn shows he’s still got it in tale of unrepentant swindler,"Penn is excellent as real-life con artist John Vogel, opposite his daughter Dylan who also does well as Vogel’s journalist daughter Jennifer",4,"Sean Penn … he’s still got it. He may have exasperated audiences with The Last Face, his previous directorial outing at Cannes, an earnest Western-aid-saviour drama that pretty much got him booed off the red carpet. But as an actor he’s still got the chops: a fierce masculine presence, a buzzard-like watchfulness always liable to break into a scornful grimace or lethal grin. His seductive address to the camera is almost unrivalled. Moreover, as a director, he knows how to bring the horsepower. And so it proves in this very watchable and well-made family drama.Penn directs and stars as notorious criminal, swindler and counterfeiter John Vogel, wanted in the 90s by the FBI for forging thousands of $100 bills from a Minnesota copy shop. His story was told in the memoir Flim Flam Man: A True Family History, by his daughter, the author and journalist Jennifer Vogel. He was a compulsively exuberant and charming man that she adored, but he broke her heart by running out on the family, by spinning endless lies, and finally by being unable to accept the redemptive love that she desperately offered him, a slippery sociopath to the last.Dylan Penn, daughter of Sean, plays Jennifer and Penn plays the toxic rogue Vogel himself. He is an appalling mix of Ryan O’Neal’s character in Paper Moon from 1973, Willy Loman from Arthur Miller’s Death of a Salesman, with a touch of the failed office-furniture supply executive who Penn played in Niels Miller’s 2004 film The Assassination of Richard Nixon. He’s a wheedling huckster who is always talking earnestly about the portfolio of business opportunities that he is curating. He also loves showing off to his family – and of course the kids are delighted at his crazy antics. But having encouraged the children to hero-worship him, John will disappear overnight when the people he owes money to become too oppressive.The film shows that his entry-level crime was the one which planted the seed of emotional destruction: setting up supposedly workable businesses like burger joints and then torching them for the insurance. The fledgling grifter John Vogel learned that the thing to do with a difficult situation was burn it all down and get out of there; in fact, any situation is tolerable only because he knows it’s all going to go up in smoke.Dylan Penn does well in the role of Jennifer, a young woman who inherited almost all of her dad’s destructive habits, like drink and drugs, but was saved by her interest in journalism, particularly investigative journalism. And of course, John himself is her story of a lifetime: the smirkingly unrepentant conman who believes his own lies, and – as his mother believes – has the sentimental entitlement of someone born on flag day. We see Penn capering around in red-white-and-blue for his birthday, and behaving as if it is everyone’s patriotic duty to give him a break.The most telling moment comes when Jennifer catches him red-handed, pretending to be talking to a car dealer on the phone, supposedly to buy her a Jaguar, the promise of this non-existent car being an emotional hold over her. While he is talking to this imaginary person, Jennifer holds the disconnected phone lead up in his face; John stares at it for a moment and then mutters into the mouthpiece: “I’ll call you back…”There are some pretty broad emotional strokes here and maybe a fair bit of grandstanding. But it’s made with some style. Flag Day screened on 10 July at the Cannes film festival. It is released on 20 August in the US and on 28 January in the UK."
Black Widow review – Scarlett Johansson’s Marvel assassin on deadly form,Florence Pugh and David Harbour add welcome comic touches to this much-delayed outing for the female Avenger,3,"Picking up where 2016’s Captain America: Civil War left off, Natasha Romanoff, AKA Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), is in exile in Norway when her annoying, estranged little sister Yelena (Florence Pugh) gets in touch. A fellow graduate of the sinister Red Room – General Dreykov’s Russian academy for training, and brainwashing, female assassins – Yelena has been deprogrammed and plans to free the other girls with her sister’s help.Their mission to take down Dreykov (Ray Winstone) involves an alpine action sequence and an army of angels of death. It feels ripped from On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, though unlike a Bond film there’s no flirting, and certainly no sex. There is, however, the underlying threat of misogyny. “I recycle the trash,” purrs Dreykov, remarking that girls are “the only natural resource the world has too much of”. His “widows” are lobotomised and given forced hysterectomies. Yet the film spends scant time exploring the implications of these darker themes, and doesn’t attempt to understand the root of Dreykov’s god complex.Instead, it’s more comfortable in comedy mode, and most interested in the family dynamic between Natasha, Yelena and their adopted parents, scientist Melina (Rachel Weisz) and former special agent Alexei (David Harbour, having a blast as a bumbling, past-it superhero whose costume no longer fits). Yelena is a perfect comic foil for the opaque, steely Natasha, a sparkling pinwheel of energy whose warmth and sardonic humour should cement her place as a new fan favourite in the Marvel cinematic universe."
The Storms of Jeremy Thomas review – Mark Cousins rides shotgun with uber-producer,Film-maker Cousins joins the great independent film producer on his annual car trip down to Cannes in this rapturous if indulgent portrait,4,"Ninety minutes at the sweet trolley of pure cinephilia is what’s on offer in director Mark Cousins’s madly – even outrageously – indulgent documentary-riff about the life and career of celebrated English film producer Jeremy Thomas, an elegant independent spirit in a corporate world. Thomas is a veritable auteur of auteurs, the godfather-slash-midwife-cum-creative enabler to some of the most exciting movies of the past 40 years, including Bertolucci’s The Last Emperor, Cronenberg’s Crash, Roeg’s Bad Timing and many more (though I would have liked a mention of Matteo Garrone’s freaky Tale of Tales).Cousins affectionately calls him “the prince” in his voiceover, in tribute to Jeremy being Brit-cinema royalty: he is, respectively, son and nephew of directors Ralph Thomas and Gerald Thomas (of Doctor and Carry On fame). Cousins wackily frames his film as something between a home movie and a road movie, riding shotgun in Thomas’s sleek Alfa Romeo as the producer brings him along on his annual five-day car journey down through France to the Cannes film festival. And on the way, he chats to Thomas about life, the movies and everything, while interspersing this with clips from Thomas’s films, and interviews with his many admirers and colleagues, including Tilda Swinton and Debra Winger.It has to be said this is hardcore, movie-mad immersion and prose-poem free-associating, targeted at the cinema faithful and very much a festival event. And for those who are not used to Cousins’s style and inimitable vocal presence, and perhaps hoping for more talk from the man in the title, it could be a bit too much to take. Anyone coming to this film hoping for some nuts-and-bolts insight into what a producer actually does, and the ever-present worries about money, will be disappointed. This film floats free from that sort of banal consideration. But as always, I find myself considering that in a world where everyone’s a cynic and an ironist, Cousins’s unaffected rapture is unique and refreshing. And there is an odd-couple comedy here, with Cousins as the unstoppably garrulous super-fan and Thomas as the reticent English gentleman, almost like a charismatic Cambridge don on the long vacation, who has picked up a voluble hitchhiker.Perhaps Thomas, a model of charm and self-effacement (which of course conceals a hypervigilant creative alertness), is unused to being at the centre of attention, for all his iconic status: normally, he is a couple of steps to one side as the director, a Bernardo Bertolucci or a Takashi Miike, basks in the limelight. But that is a position he relishes. Ironically, film is not a medium that really captures the subtlety and intimacy of Jeremy Thomas’s personality. Showbusiness is full of bigmouth showoffs claiming to be “shy”. But Thomas is the real thing. Possibly radio would come closer.At the end of all this, Cousins makes Thomas take a word-association test. He says “Cannes” and the producer shoots back: “Do”. It is the perfect producer response. A producer has got to make things happen, make connections and see opportunities, and Thomas says that the festival is where he has a “line out” like a fisherman, waiting for a new idea or talent to swim up. It is a pleasure to sit on the riverbank alongside him.The Storms of Jeremy Thomas screened at the Cannes film festival and is released on 10 December in UK cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema."
Mothering Sunday review – Josh O’Connor doomed romance overdoes the ennui,"This adaptation of the Graham Swift novel look and sounds lush, but the pace is so languorous your emotions never have a chance to get going",3,"There’s a tasteful ennui and gorgeous torpor to this well-acted movie, set in Britain’s Home Counties between the wars — in which the middle-aged ruling classes are quietly stricken with misery about almost all their sons being slaughtered on the French battlefields. The film is adapted by screenwriter Alice Birch from the 2016 novella by Graham Swift, and directed by Eva Husson.Australian actor Odessa Young plays Jane, the maid at a grand house ruled over by the sad Mr and Mrs Niven (Colin Firth and Olivia Colman) who are not making a fuss about their children being dead. Jane is having a secret, passionate affair with Paul, beguilingly played by Josh O’Connor, the well-born son of the Nivens’ neighbours, the Sheringhams, and on Mothering Sunday, her day off, she has plans to bicycle over to Paul’s house while his parents and servants are away, for a secret assignation.Paul is the only one of his peer group to have returned from the Front, and burdened by his survivor’s guilt and the realisation that so much is now expected of him: including a prestigious legal career and marriage to someone who isn’t a maid. So Paul and Jane’s afternoon love-making, and Jane’s languid postcoital nude sauntering around his posh house, her fingertips trailing along the spines of first editions, is coloured by this mood of looming loss and regret.It is a lovely-looking, lovely-sounding movie, handsomely designed, meticulously shot and impeccably performed — and it also has interesting things to say about the emotional toughness and the Greeneian splinter of ice in the heart, that is needed by a writer. But I have to admit that, despite my liking for slow cinema, I found something a bit indulgent and classy about the unvarying andante pace. To use a prehistoric analogy, it often felt like that moment when DJ John Peel accidentally put a 45rpm record on at 33. I wanted a jolt of passion, of anger, of something, to wake this film out of its dreamy melancholy. But then it has to be said that this moonscape is very well crafted and Olivia Colman does, in her way, deliver a jolt of rage mixed with a swallowed despair.Jane has ambitions to be a writer, and later you see the older, more mature Jane who is in a relationship with academic philosopher Donald (Sope Dirisu) and later Glenda Jackson has a cameo as Jane as the renowned and elderly star author, disconcerting journalists with her unimpressed reaction to news that she has won a certain big prize — a moment amusingly calling to mind Doris Lessing’s famously dismissive response to being told by reporters she had got the Nobel. Jane is an orphan, and Mrs Niven, in her cynical wretchedness and despair, tells her that being born bereaved and motherless is a great gift: she has no-one to care about. Of course, we know that this isn’t true. But Odessa Young shows us that it is not an entirely inaccurate description of Jane; she is tough, she has that writer’s detachment.There is a lot to admire in this film, though I wanted a bolt of lightning to burst through the cloudcover of sadness. Mothering Sunday is released on 12 November in cinemas."
Between Two Worlds review – Juliette Binoche goes undercover in the gig economy,Emmanuel Carrère’s drama – based on Florence Aubenas’s bestseller Le Quai de Ouistreham – fails to probe fully the injustices faced by low-paid workers,2,"Novelist and film-maker Emmanuel Carrère has contrived this earnestly intentioned but naive and supercilious drama about poverty and the gig economy, starring a tearful Juliette Binoche. It is adapted from the French nonfiction bestseller Le Quai de Ouistreham from 2010 by investigative journalist Florence Aubenas, published in the UK under the title The Night Cleaner.In it, Aubenas describes her experiences “going undercover” and working in the brutal world of cleaning in Caen in northern France, where desperate applicants have to burnish their CVs with fatuous assurances about how passionate they are about cleaning, in return for dehumanising work with pitiful pay, grisly conditions and no job security. The grimmest part of the work is scrubbing lavatories and cleaning cabins on the ferry between Ouistreham and Portsmouth. The book is in the undercover tradition of George Orwell’s Down and Out in Paris and London, Barbara Ehrenreich’s Nickel and Dimed and Polly Toynbee’s Hard Work: Life in Low-Pay Britain.Perhaps what might have been valuable would have been a documentary fronted by Aubenas herself, about what has and hasn’t been achieved for gig workers in France since her book came out – or, arguably, a Loachian fiction based on the real lives of these workers. What Carrère has done is create a drama in which it is the fictionalised Aubenas who is the centre of an imagined gallery of toughly courageous workers – her new best friends. The real dramatic crisis comes with Aubenas’s awful dilemma when she has to confess to them she has been fibbing all this time, and using their lives as raw material for her book, which she will write as soon as she returns to her wealthy and fashionable life in Paris. Some of her soon-to-be-jettisoned pals will forgive her when they see how important her book is. Some may not.Despite this unbearably obtuse and self-important emotional finale, there is some eye-opening material about the gig workers’ lives and some nice performances. And, of course, the issue of whether such journalism is delusional or parasitic is a perfectly valid one. (It is part of the comic point of Preston Sturges’s 1941 satire Sullivan’s Travels, about the movie director who announces that he will live as a hobo to make his earnest magnum opus O Brother, Where Art Thou?)Yet Binoche’s character never herself reflects that the lived experience of this kind of work is brutal because of the knowledge that this is all you have: the undercover journalist knows that he or she can return to a comfortable life reasonably soon – a life made even more comfortable by a potential bestseller (and film deal).The film finally behaves as if the journalist’s drama is as important as its ostensible subject, the injustice of exploitative employment practices, and doesn’t even investigate that issue thoroughly. Aubenas’s real life in Paris may well have had all sorts of crises and complications in which things were personally at stake for her, but they don’t feature here. Neither of the two worlds of the film’s English title is illuminated clearly enough.Between Two Worlds screened at the Cannes film festival and is released in the UK on 27 May in cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema."
Annette review – Adam Driver magnificent in wild Sparks musical,"Driver and Marion Cotillard brim with nervous energy in this bizarre musical collaboration between Leos Carax and the Sparks brothers, which kicks off this year’s film festival",4,"Leos Carax is the sly anarchist of French cinema whose sorties are sadly few and far between. Now he has broken cover with this barking mad fantasia, an almost entirely sung-through musical tragedy created with Ron and Russell Mael from Sparks, a band once thought to be relegated to YouTube clips of 70s Top of the Pops but now having a moment, thanks to this, together with a forthcoming documentary about them by Edgar Wright called The Sparks Brothers, and indeed their appearance in a Viz comic strip with the great socialist philosopher – Marx and Sparks.Ron and Russell make their first appearance here in a recording studio with Carax behind the glass. “So may we start?” demands the director. And start they do, with the Maels, Carax, his stars Marion Cotillard and Adam Driver and the entire cast singing as they march out of the studio and into the streets of downtown Los Angeles, ready to begin the entirely bizarre action.This film gives us the fanaticism of Cavalcanti’s ventriloquist dummy from Dead of Night, the self-hate of James Mason from A Star Is Born, the desperate father-daughter dysfunction of Georges Franju’s Eyes Without a Face (which Carax referenced in his last film, Holy Motors) and perhaps most obviously the strident sadness of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Phantom of the Opera. Let’s incidentally not be too snobbish about Andrew Lloyd Webber – the “Love Never Dies” title song from the Phantom sequel was used in a film by no less a world-cinema luminary than Abbas Kiarostami.Driver plays Henry, an aggressive comedian-ranter in LA with a controversial reputation and a fading career, shuffling around in the wings like Jake LaMotta in a boxer’s robe, smoking a cigarette, and then coming on to discard the robe revealing a gym-built body. He will bait the audiences with his hostile riffs and singing interludes (for which he has a backing chorus), occasionally staging horribly tasteless Bataclan-style fake gun attacks on himself just to shock everyone. Of course, fictional comedians doing their act in films have the same problems as fictional artists showing their fictional paintings. Is this supposed to be good, or not? Well, Henry’s act is clearly not intended to be conventionally funny.Henry is in a relationship and in love with his polar opposite, Ann, a charismatic and exquisitely beautiful opera singer played by Cotillard, whom Carax imagines splendidly alone on colossal, quasi-expressionistic sets. She comes from the highest of high culture, her reputation jealously protected by the opera house’s conductor (played by Simon Helberg, the self-effacing accompanist from Florence Foster Jenkins) who is not-so-secretly in love with her himself. After the performance, Ann’s bad-boy boyfriend will show up outside the opera house on his motorbike and whisk her off to their beautiful home in the hills to make love. Soon, Ann is pregnant, but she is troubled by rumours (or dreams) that aggressively macho Henry is about to be hit with a #MeToo case.Their relationship ends with tragedy - and there is something very disquieting about their baby girl, Annette, who looks like a wooden marionette and can sing with her mother’s amazing, grownup voice. Soon, the increasingly bleary, mad and humiliated Henry devotes himself to being Annette’s full-time svengali. Any hopes we might have had that this could somehow end well are to be dashed.The bad-dream quality of Annette comes very particularly from the “theatre audience” scenes that Carax repeatedly stages for Henry, Ann and Annette: huge, mysterious banks of faces who are transported with passion or sceptical or mutinous. Are they real? Are they a dream? There is something Buñuelian about their massed presence.Annette is a forthright and declamatory and crazy spectacle, teetering over the cliff edge of its own nervous breakdown, demanding that we feel its pain, feel its pleasure and take it seriously. I think it isn’t quite as imaginative and complex as Carax’s previous film, Holy Motors, and I was a little disappointed that there was relatively little for Marion Cotillard to do. But Adam Driver has a malign magnificence, that equine face progressively losing its nobility as he gets more violent and depressed and finally ages by about 30 years.And there are some extraordinary moments, such as Cotillard and Driver’s duet We Love Each Other So Much as they have sex and their baby is born nightmarishly with a clown face. I can imagine this as a concept album, a Broadway show, maybe a site-specific installation at the LA house that is shown in the movie. It’s a swoon of anxiety and rapture. Annette is released in the UK on 3 September"
The Story of Film: A New Generation review – invigorating study of 21st century cinema,"Critic and film-maker Mark Cousins offers a new instalment in his monumental Story of Film series, examining what digital technology has brought to the table",4,"Critic and documentary film-maker Mark Cousins has returned with another episode of his amazingly ambitious cinephile history The Story of Film, an illuminated patchwork clip-quilt, accompanied by his inimitable incantation-voiceover. It’s another example of his unique approach: Cousins is subjective almost to the point of free-associating or even sleep-talking (maybe appropriate for the dream state of the movies) but also colossally well-informed, bracingly internationalist and genuinely educational. I have never yet watched a Cousins film without learning something and being a bit sheepish about what I didn’t know.That said, Cousins’s style takes some getting used to – almost like a hyper-innocent form of criticism, wide-eyed with wonder at cinema’s brave new world, a Miranda of the movies. Occasionally Cousins’s commentary verges on the superfluous, simply describing what is on screen, although there is almost always a shrewd insight there: he has a great section on a creepy travelling shot in David Robert Mitchell’s psychological horror It Follows.Really, Cousins is notable for taking what is on screen at face value, transcribing what he takes to be the film-maker’s exact intentions from what he sees, moment-by-moment, where another type of critic would deconstruct, attempt to see through and see past the imagery, to find other meanings. That is not really Cousins’s style and in a critical arena where everyone’s a cynic and an ironist, Cousins wears his heart on his sleeve.The point of this film is to get a fix on where we’re at now with 21st century cinema: what has changed? Cousins wonders aloud about digital camera technology and the new kinds of movies that this has made possible: films shot on iPhones and edited with a new generation of affordable desktop technology. There are the worlds of YouTube, gaming and Google Street View increasing cinema’s sense of how quickly the world can be encompassed, how quickly the images can be found and published. And cinema has had to respond with its own renewed speed and appetite for the world.But then it has always had to, and it’s difficult to pin down or summarise exactly what this film is saying about how film has changed. (Cousins does not in fact restrict himself to clips from the 21st century, and this is not much different from his previous films.) Perhaps the subject itself is elusive. Oddly, Cousins says little about something which, rightly or wrongly, is thought to be a great threat to the cinema: the streaming services of Netflix, Amazon etc. And for me, it was notable that this film didn’t touch what I consider to be the new century’s two great failed experiments in cinema: the revival of 3D, which was supposed to be here to stay but which has now been quietly dropped without anyone saying a word, and the dabbling with High FrameRate (48 frames per second), used by Peter Jackson and Ang Lee, and capable of staggering detail-definition, but also capable of making everything look like banal video without the richness and density of film. This, too, seems to have quietly abandoned.What is invigorating about The Story of Film is that each new clip, each new comment, is an exercise in back to basics, an exercise in looking, and looking again and looking harder – something that’s even more difficult when it feels like we’re drowning in content. And his focus on politically engaged documentaries is also invigorating. This is an unashamed celebration of cinema as an art-form: Cousins is an aesthete.The Story of Film: A New Generation screened at the Cannes film festival and is released in the UK on 17 December."
Son review – creepy slice of southern gothic that is the mother of all horror movies,"Occult-tinged mother-son yarn covers the same ground as the likes of The Omen and Hereditary, but struggles to sustain momentum",2,"This moody horror begins at a frenzied pitch: a panicked drive down a foggy highway at night, a pregnant woman about to give birth at the wheel. Like her, the story is looking for a new place to go; but it never really finds one. On its own terms, it’s a serviceably creepy slice of occult-tinged mother-son horror, but the story is constantly bumping into predecessors that have already covered this territory, including The Omen, Hereditary, The Babadook and True Detective.The woman is Laura, played by Andi Matichak, star of David Gordon Green’s 2018 Halloween. After the prologue, we catch up with her eight years later, a stable single mother to an angelic son David (Luke David Blumm), happily living her small-town life. Until one night she walks into David’s bedroom and sees a group of strangers gathered around his bed. She immediately runs for help. When she returns, the people are gone. Did she just imagine it?Sympathetic police officer Paul (Emile Hirsch) gives her the benefit of the doubt, but then, she’s an attractive single mum and he’s a lonely single cop. David, however, is not himself. He complains of pains. He vomits blood. He goes into a coma and is rushed to hospital. His mystery condition does not necessarily improve. Flashbacks hint at Laura’s history of abuse and psychological problems, and connections with some kind of cult, which she believes is still after her. Are they really all out to get her, or is it all in her head? Either way, mother and son take to the road across the desolate rural south, with the cops following their increasingly bloody trail.There are moments of suspense and gory horror here, but, having played its hand early, the story struggles to sustain momentum or mystery. Refusing to fill in key pieces of the puzzle – such as Laura’s abusive father – doesn’t help. A few late twists aren’t enough to rescue it. Son is released on 8 July on Shudder."
The Tomorrow War review – time stretches in Chris Pratt’s alien-invasion sci-fi,Pratt plays a teacher turned pre-emptive conscript for a future war with aliens in this overlong and derivative actioner,2,"We’ve come an awfully long way since Chris Pratt was the goofy comic turn Andy Dwyer in TV’s Parks and Recreation, pretending to be top-secret FBI agent Burt Macklin. These days he’s got the chops to be a tough, chiselled action lead who removes his shirt to reveal some serious work with the personal trainer, and this is how he’s presented in this great big overstuffed and overlong sci-fi action thriller from former animation director Chris McKay. In Guardians of the Galaxy and Jurassic World, Pratt had at least some residue of his former comedy existence, and to be fair there are one or two funny lines here (coming largely from JK Simmons, playing Pratt’s grumpy yet adorable dad), but this is a very earnest and generic lead performance.Pratt plays Dan Forester, an idealistic soldier-turned-high school teacher with a wife and young daughter; he lives in an America that is suddenly terrified by visitors from the future who reveal that in 30 years’ time Earth will be attacked by weird, white, lizard-like creatures (not a million miles away from those in the sci-fi horror A Quiet Place). Humanity is so low on soldiers that they have to time-travel into the past to recruit more personnel and bring them into the future to fight this “tomorrow war” against the alien creatures. And Dan is duly drafted into the head-spinningly weird conflict, coming into contact with fellow warriors like cheerfully nerdy Charlie (Sam Richardson), tough and cynical Dorian (Edwin Hodge) and also Norah (Mary Lynn Rajskub). But most importantly there is the charismatic female commanding officer, played by Yvonne Strahovski (from The Handmaid’s Tale). The encounter messes with Dan’s mind: you’ve heard of back to the future, but this is forward to the past, or maybe sideways to the next generation.Inevitably, we are confronted with the possibility of having to travel right back into the past to fight the war on the home turf of the present day in some kind of pre-emptive sense – shades of The Terminator – and as with all “time travel” movies we have to ignore the logical impossibilities that this involves. The film seems to go on and on like something by Wagner; but it finally ends, thanks to some vital expertise provided by one of Dan’s high school students, with a plot turn which perhaps owes something to the final act of the classic comedy Galaxy Quest. It all feels like a heavy meal, and the action scenes and the creature effects are very derivative. The Tomorrow War is on Amazon Prime Video from 2 July."
The Forever Purge review – will this franchise ever end?,"It’s more of the same in the latest Purge horror, with more murderous mayhem and more half-baked attempts at social commentary",2,"The catharsis brought about from the fictional “purge” – the 12 hours every year when all crime is legal – has become somewhat similar to that felt by some audiences watching each new entry in the franchise. Ever since the second film opened up the universe only teased at in the original, series creator James DeMonaco has made strides, clumsy as they might be, to infuse the mayhem with a thin vein of angry social commentary, loosely specific to the time of release.With 2014’s The Purge: Anarchy, it was class warfare. In 2016’s The Purge: Election Year, it was quite predictably politics. In 2018’s The First Purge, it was about racial tension. Each one bristled with more anger than the last, giving bloodthirsty crowds a reason to cheer as Nazis, racists and xenophobes got their comeuppance. With the latest, and hopefully last, entry, The Forever Purge (arriving after two seasons of a rather dull TV series), the focus is on immigration, the action centered on the border wall and how white nationalist purgers try to extend the mandated chaos in order to “purify” the country. It’s brutal, bracing stuff for the multiplex but once again, an easy target is missed. On the one hand, it’s admirable that a wide-releasing horror franchise would go to great lengths to Say Something but on the other, what it has to say is so cartoonishly blunt that one questions what effect it really has.In this gloomy new installment, it’s time for the purge once again, the umpteenth one for America (referred to as the “United States of hate” here) but the first for Mexican immigrant couple Adela (an effectively enraged Ana de la Reguera) and Juan (Tenoch Huerta). Tensions are already thick for them in Texas and so an annual government-approved killing spree is not something they’re particularly excited about. After securing safe shelter for the night, they re-enter the world, surprised yet suspicious that they made it through. But they soon discover that for some, the purge isn’t over. A rebel group has decided that 12 hours isn’t enough and their primary target is anyone they don’t deem to be a true American.There’s always this curious hypocrisy within the Purge series that lambasts the violent instincts of the masses, then urges us to take great pleasure in watching those same impulses get indulged. Is it us who are ultimately being critiqued for paying to go see a gory horror film, eating popcorn as innocent people are being thrill-killed? That would be a smug Haneke-esque motive but it would at least be something. The Purge films are never quite as thought through, a rambling thesis drunkenly scrawled onto a bar napkin that never really makes a lot of sense. The stabs at satire here are laughably unsubtle (a white supremacist refers to two Mexicans as “bad hombres” before referring to his girlfriend as “Mother”) yet delivered with a silly sense of winking pride, like we should be impressed that they even made the tiniest of effort.After the all guns-blazing finale of The First Purge, the follow-up continues the franchise’s conscious move away from horror and further into action, which means that while the film is never scary, and never really tries to be, there’s at least a pacey escalation of set-pieces, decent enough to keep us awake but generic enough for us to forget them soon after. First-time director Everardo Valerio Gout is a competent technical hand but he’s hemmed in by DeMonaco’s writing, which uneasily sways from the real world horror of white supremacy to the big screen horror of cheesy one-liners. It’s hard to know how seriously we’re supposed to take any of this when it’s so unclear what the makers’ intention is and so the film’s deeper cuts fail to truly wound because so much of it is mired in silliness.The expansion of the Purge universe (from home invasion thriller to full-on border battle) has brought with it frustrating echoes of good ideas and some effectively jolting moments of brutality, but it’s a franchise continually buckling under the weight of what it thinks it is and what it thinks it’s saying. The Forever Purge might imply that purging will never end but, unless a major series refresh is on the way, let’s hope that’s not the case.The Forever Purge is out in the US on 4 July and in the UK on 16 July"
King Otto review – Greece’s Euros winner earns his place in football’s history books,The national hysteria surrounding Greece’s improbable 2004 Euros win is a sight to behold in a thoughtful portrait of the manager who made it happen,4,"Not many football documentaries kick off with a quote from Homer, but this profile of Otto Rehhagel, the German coach who steered Greece to their improbable European Championship win in 2004 is more thoughtful and, indeed, erudite than most. First pictured reflecting on classical Greek civilisation while standing inside Athens’s Panathenaic stadium (“As Greek history teaches us, the gods have their own plans”), Rehhagel is presented as football’s ultimate transnational sophisticate, able to ally his innately Teutonic sense of discipline with the Greeks’ more emotional relationship to the game.Well, most football documentaries are there to replay the greatest hits, and this one doesn’t disappoint: the Greeks fight their way past France, the Czech Republic and Portugal in the final rounds (all by 1-0) after managing to get out of the group stage by the skin of their teeth. All this is well known, if such an extraordinary outlier in world football that it’s since almost been blanked out of the collective consciousness. Nevertheless the increasing national hysteria during the team’s progress is a sight to behold, as is the glee with which Rehhagel and his assistant Ioannis Topalidis mug one side after another to win the title. (My personal favourite cameo, though, is from Vassilis Gagatsis, the perpetually doleful president of the Greek football federation; to see him screaming to the heavens when the final whistle eventually blows is one of the most uplifting things I’ve ever seen.)Rehhagel emerges as an interesting, even conflicted character. Not unnaturally, he appears to have a pretty high opinion of himself, but conducts himself with a certain measure of style and articulacy as he grapples with the scope of what he has achieved. Topalidis talks a good game, too, explaining how he modified Rehhagel’s more direct pronouncements into a formulation less likely to put the players’ backs up. As with most great football stories, there is a tale of redemption underlying all this; you can’t say it isn’t fully deserved. King Otto is released on 5 July on digital platforms."
Lady Boss: The Jackie Collins Story review – weirdly incurious but watchable documentary,"Laura Fairrie’s family-sanctioned film praises the author’s personal courage, work ethic and feminism-lite but doesn’t delve very deep",3,"Mega-selling author Jackie Collins enjoyed her big-haired and shoulder-padded heyday with raunchy books like Hollywood Wives, The Bitch and The Stud; now she is celebrated in this family-sanctioned fan-documentary praising her personal courage in the face of spousal abuse, her work ethic and her feminist-lite celebration of commercial success for sexually attractive women. It’s watchable, with some stinging rebukes for the male snobs – including, I’m sorry to say, Clive James, normally a great pop culture ally, shown here in a gruesome TV clip alongside Bernard Levin mocking Collins in her absence.Collins grew up in the shadow of her more glamorous older sister Joan Collins, she had some cosmetic work done (which she was delighted with) and tried, like Joan, to crack Hollywood. When that didn’t work out, Collins went into fiction with her first novel, saucily entitled The World Is Full of Married Men, was thrilled with her advance of £400, and as the years went by, she had the complex satisfaction of seeing her status rise as her sister’s gradually fell. But Collins had to fight horrible and abusive first and third husbands – though her second was wonderfully supportive.We get lots of photos and home video material from her family archive, showing Collins hanging out with the Michael Caines and the Roger Moores. But it is a weirdly incurious documentary in its way; there are loads of talking-head contributions from devoted friends and family, including of course from her sister and unacknowledged rival Joan, but nothing from other writers, and nothing comparing her to the other galacticos of her industry, like Jacqueline Susann or Harold Robbins.The film also loyally takes at face value Collins’s claims to be a feminist, and Collins boldly used that word when many were, and are, scared to. But perhaps it would have been interesting to speak to feminists – other feminists, that is – to ask if they agree. There’s not much in the way of social context either. The title of this movie is taken from one of her books, and I was waiting for someone to mention that other great lady boss of the 1980s era. Well, perhaps director Laura Fairrie thought that would have been too obvious. In the end, Collins emerges as an opaque figure, as resistant to interpretation as her famously 2D fictional heroine Lucky Santangelo. Lady Boss: The Jackie Collins Story is in cinemas from 2 July."
White on White review – a damning snapshot of South American colonisation,"A loner photographer looks down on white settlers without realising he’s part of the problem in a striking, ambiguous historical drama",3,"Colonisation does not come off well in this sparse and striking drama, set in snowbound 19th-century Tierra del Fuego. It’s a sombre study of the corrupted values and decayed morals that enabled a genocide; it centres on a photographer who considers himself superior to the coarse white settlers around him, but is really part of the same system. This is Pedro (Alfredo Castro), a middle-aged loner who has been brought to this end-of-the-world location to take the wedding portrait of Mr Porter, the big landowner. But when he arrives, Mr Porter is nowhere to be found; only his bride, Sara, who looks little older than a teenager. In an early, uncomfortable scene, Pedro blithely “arranges” Sara into what he considers an attractive pose, pulling her wedding dress off her shoulders, ostensibly for the groom’s benefit: “He’ll like it better this way.” The scene is to be reprised even more excruciatingly later on, after Pedro takes a shine to Sara and sets up a more “artistic” photoshoot.Pedro doesn’t find much else to appreciate here. In Mr Porter’s absence, he is consigned to an extended stay among the (overwhelmingly male) settlers, whose exploits he dignifies with his camera but whose company he shuns – initially, at least. These Europeans are making their first inroads into this landscape: erecting houses, putting up fences, and killing and kidnapping the indigenous population. They are paid according to the number of human ears they bring back. “Think of it as humanitarian work,” one of them tells Pedro.Director Théo Court does a fine job of capturing the barren beauty of this landscape and using it to suggest the broader moral vacuum. There are contrasts between the blinding daytime brightness and pitch-black nights, human figures are reduced to ant-like presences in the vast expanses. At times, though, the storytelling is a little too distant, and the narrative momentum falters. Perhaps conscious of the issues of representation he is dealing with, Court invites us to come to our own conclusions rather than spoon-feeding us a point of view. White on White is released on 30 June on Mubi."
Triumph review – RJ Mitte grapples with sporting ambition in the wrestling ring,"Based on the screenwriter’s own youth, this underdog disability story wins points for authenticity, but sports movie cliches blunt the impact",2,"With actors with disabilities often confined to supporting roles, Triumph could have been a breath of fresh air. Centring on the rarely seen athletic journey of a character with a motor disorder, this underdog, coming-of-age sports movie has a big heart but lacks the competency to execute its aspirational premise.Mike (RJ Mitte) is a handsome high school freshman with a particularly disarming smile. He dreams of joining the wrestling team; however, because he has cerebral palsy, the obstacles are numerous. Not only does Mike endure jeers and bullying from other students, his caring but overly protective father also attempts to dissuade him from participating in organised sports. In the face of such hurdles, Mike fortunately has the unwavering support of the tough-but-fair Coach Cutting (Terrence Howard) and his new best friend/star athlete Jeff (Colton Haynes). With each arduous session of training, Mike not only grows as an athlete but also acquires timeless life lessons.Inspired by the teenage years of screenwriter Michael D Coffey, who grew up with cerebral palsy, the film does strive for authenticity, especially in terms of casting. Best known for playing Walter White Jr in Breaking Bad, Mitte has the condition himself, and infuses a rather thinly written character with a lot of tenacity and charisma. In fact, though based on truth, the story feels more like a sports film checklist, restlessly jumping from one cliche to another with little emotional weight. In contrast to Mitte’s committed performance, Howard pretty much phones it in with a near monotonous line reading; the cinematography is also particularly distracting, with a penchant for a halo-like effect that obscures the characters’ faces and proves especially ill-suited during wrestling sequences where the athletes’ bodies become blurry rather than powerful.This might work as an OK family-friendly watch, but good intentions are not enough to make a good movie. Triumph is released on 28 June on digital platforms."
Sparkling: The Story of Champagne review – a fine aperitif for the summer,"Bolly or Veuve Cliquot? If you ever wanted to bluff your way through that baffling list of bubblies, then pick this warm-hearted film   ",3,"Irish film producer and distribution executive Frank Mannion makes a genial host and guide to this polished survey of the highest of high-end sparkling wines; it’s entertaining in itself to watch Mannion gulping down giant goblets of the vintage under the guise of interviewing the heads of various champagne houses. There’s very much a wine-tour atmosphere to this documentary, particularly in the first half as Mannion wanders from one vineyard HQ to another, most of them located in gleaming perfume-factory type cubes perched oddly in the French countryside. If you ever thought champagnes were pretty much the same, whatever the label, well, this parade of beautifully turned-out old school champagne-makers will put you straight on the difference between Veuve Cliquot, Pol Roger, Bollinger, and the rest.In the middle section, Mannion’s attention turns to the beverage’s successful attempts to market itself internationally – “Champagne Charlie”, AKA Charles Heidsieck of Piper Heidsieck renown, appears to be the key figure here – as well as the way champagne has smartly inserted itself into top-end entertainment and sporting events, from James Bond to Wimbledon, to keep its glamour ratings high.In the final third, the focus changes to British attempts to get into the sparkling wine game; and if Mannion throughout is generally happy to let business owners do their marketing spiel at considerable length, in this last bit it goes into overdrive: it’s practically a longform advert for English sparkling wine estates such as Bolney, Wiston and Hush Heath. And although the “B” word – Brexit – doesn’t get a mention, there’s still an edge to the jolly home counties joshing of the French wine-makers in the British gun sights over who actually invented the stuff. (Slightly less jolly is the chuckling over global heating that may give British vintners a bit of assistance over the next few years.) Be that as it may, this is a warm-hearted, pleasant film, full of enthusiasm for its subject; a fine aperitif for the summer. Sparkling: The Story of Champagne is released on 25 June in cinemas."
Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds review – swashbuckling for the very young,A gallant mutt goes comes up against corset-wearing cats in this CGI reboot of the 80s TV series,2,"The popular 1980s animated TV series has been given a CGI update, with gallant, sword-wielding hero Dogtanian (Tomas Ayuso) now rendered in plasticky, squidgy 3D. A riff on Alexandre Dumas’s Three Musketeers, the young Dogtanian journeys from 17th-century Béarn to Paris in the hope of becoming one of Louis XIII’s guard dogs – a “muskehound” – and clearing his disgraced father’s name.There’s a diamond heist and a gruff-voiced, double-crossing mouse. In this cartoon universe, dogs ride horses and walk on their hind legs; cats such as Milady de Winter (Elisabeth Gray) wear corsets and are, of course, evil. The film’s world of Beauty and the Beast-style pastel houses and swashbuckling masculinity is unsophisticated, if not totally unenjoyable, and clearly geared towards very young children."
The Man Standing Next review – a thrilling scramble for political power in 70s South Korea,"Based on a real 1979 military coup, this year’s Oscars submission from South Korea captivates with alliances, betrayals – and a climax worth waiting for",3,"This is a suspenseful but fiendishly complex political thriller from South Korea, which was the country’s submission for best international film for the most recent Oscars, though it didn’t make the final five shortlist. That doesn’t necessarily mean it’s not a solid film, but viewers whose introduction to Korean cinema was director Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite, which rightly won all the big prizes the year before, should be warned not to expect anything quite as audacious or accessible here.In fact, director Woo Min-ho’s drama feels aimed more at a domestic audience, covering as it does the tense days in 1979 when a military coup and an assassination determined who would ultimately come to power. Although based on actual events, a disclaimer at the beginning warns that some dramatic licence has been taken to tell the story, which was in turn based on a novel. At the centre of the story is President Park (played by Lee Sung-min), who has been the top dog for 18 years. His de facto second in command is the head of the Korean CIA, Kim Gyu-pyeong (Lee Byung-hun, excellent), a narrow-faced civil servant who shuttles diplomatically between Seoul and Washington DC, where another compatriot, Park Yong-gak (Kwak Do-won), is testifying before a US congressional committee and threatening to publish a memoir that will spill the beans about corruption in the highest ranks of the government.That’s just the start of a complex quadrille of alliances and betrayals, performed mostly in darkened, panelled rooms, as the soundtrack provides a constant percussive beat spelling doom for several figures. There’s a long wait until something really meaty happens, in every sense, but the climactic killing in a restaurant, complete with spluttering arteries and swooping camerawork, is just about worth the wait. The Man Standing Next is released on 25 June in virtual cinemas."
The Filmmaker’s House review – a microcosm of British society pops round for tea,"London-based documentarian Marc Isaacs films the interactions of his builder, cleaner and neighbours in a playful work that is just a little too at home with manipulation",3,"“I’m not bloody interested in serial killers, Rachel; I’m interested in ordinary human beings,” sighs veteran documentary-maker Marc Isaacs on a Skype call to his producer, who tells him programmers are only interested in sensationalist themes nowadays. Isaacs sticks to his guns. As the title implies, this inventive but flawed effort barely leaves his London terrace home. What’s less obvious, at least initially, is whether it is documentary or fiction. The eventual answer is a bit of both. Having chronicled so many aspects of Britishness in his documentary career, Isaacs contrives a sort of microcosmic state of our multicultural nation here: a gentle clash of cultural attitudes and boundaries.The dramatis personae are craftily assembled. There is a Slovakian homeless man, Mikel, whose request for a drink becomes an extended stay. Isaacs’ Colombian cleaner, Nery, who has recently lost her mother, happens to be in that day. As does his builder Keith, a textbook old, white, overweight Englishman with a passion for football and a dodgy heart. By “coincidence”, just as Nery is dealing with the cat bringing a pigeon into the house, Isaacs’ niqab-wearing Pakistani neighbour, Zara, pops round with a gift of food during Ramadan.The conversations and interactions between these people are revealing and entertaining. Their contrasting attitudes towards home, hospitality and family are thought-provoking. But there is a “structured reality” feel to proceedings which leaves us doubting their authenticity. (No serial killers turn up, but there is a brush with mortality.) These people appear to be non-actors playing themselves, but not always convincingly. This is especially true of Zara, whose readiness to explain and criticise her own culture feels implausible. Isaacs himself is a playful, self-deprecating presence, but just as the story falls between stools of fact and fiction, so his own positions as generous host, privileged employer and dispassionate observer make for a certain awkwardness. It doesn’t quite come off, but it’s a laudable attempt. The Filmmaker’s House is released on 25 June in cinemas and on digital platforms."
Buckley’s Chance review – Bill Nighy’s bad accent fronts an onerous slab of outback flapdoodle,"Family film conveys an old-timey, clichéd impression of life in Australia that has ‘exportable’ written all over it",1,"In Henry VIII, Shakespeare addressed ambition as a desire that suckers in the best of people and dooms even the mighty: “By that sin fell the angels.” A similar thing can be said about performing an Australian accent: by that nasally sounding, mangle-mouthed modulative sin (I can say that; I’m Aussie) many great performers, many angels, many warriors of cinematic virtue have plummeted from the sky like Icarus and fallen flat on their arse.There have been some fine examples over the years of foreigners convincingly pulling off our notoriously difficult national drawl – including Meryl Streep (Evil Angels), Kate Winslet (The Dressmaker), Dev Patel (Lion) and Liev Schreiber (Mental). But sadly the great Bill Nighy joins the not-so-great-at-Aussie-accents club in Buckley’s Chance – an onerous, insipid, unlikeable slab of outback flapdoodle about a 13-year-old kid from New York, Ridley (Milan Burch), who comes to Australia with his mum. There he meets his estranged grandpa Spencer (Nighy), befriends a dingo and gets lost in the wilderness.It’s a Yoram Gross style plotline, but director Tim Brown insists he’s making a credible family-oriented drama, aspiring perhaps for a Red Dog-style combination of serious and silly, light and dark. Everybody comes away looking and sounding like a flamin’ galah (to use the kind of expressions favoured by the screenwriters), including Nighy, eschewing extreme ockerism for a gentler, softer, dare I say it more British interpretation of the Australian accent.At times the veteran actor’s delivery feels so casual it borders on somnambulistic – as if he might nod off at any moment, or as if he has forgotten he is supposed to be Australian. Nighy’s performance isn’t as embarrassing as Quentin Tarantino in Django Unchained or Kirby Howell-Baptiste in The Good Place – but these are extremely low standards. It’s definitely one to wash off the resume with a high-powered hose.Brown presents an old-timey, clichéd impression of life in Australia that has “exportable” written all over it, designed to appeal to the sensibilities of foreign audiences happy to believe Australians do things like ride kangaroos to school or make best friends with dingoes. Ridley does indeed become bonded to said canine; after freeing it from a trap it follows him around and protects him, like a kind of magical guardian, attacking dangerous snakes and snarling at bad guys.Nighy meanwhile tosses around lines such as “If I see your face in a camera, I’ll toss it in a billabong!” It’s as if the screenwriters (Brown and Willem Wennekers) have never set foot in Australia and based their research entirely on old tourism videos. Prawns on a barbie, you never never know if you never never go, that kind of thing.The excellent Kelton Pell tries his best to bring some gravitas to his supporting performance as Spencer’s ranch hand, on his property called Buckley’s Chance. But like all the actors he’s kneecapped by an oppressively bad script, which on its better occasions has him delivering subtext and character-explaining lines such as “Spencer may be strict, but he’s fair”. Spencer is also a bit of a jerk – not old and aggro in that slightly rascally, sort of endearing way, but in a way that says: I know I’m mean and I don’t care. On top of the bad accent, Nighy’s character has zero charm.In every instance of supposed dramatic importance, a smothering score informs us what to expect and how to feel. When Martin Sacks and two cronies (who are not comic relief but nor can they be taken seriously) appear for the first time, playing locals pressuring old Spencer to sell his land, ominous music declares that they are very bad men. A giant sign above them flashing “VILLAINS!” with a downwards pointing arrow would have been equally as subtle.One of these cronies has the gall to blurt at Spencer that he’s “in the way of the path of progress”. It’s a clanging line that would never come from a blockheaded rube like him – the kind of cartoon idiot who has difficulty tying his own shoelaces. Things get hairy for Ridley when, having stumbled upon a plan to burn down grandpa’s property, he hides from the villains in the back of their own truck (he’s also an idiot), meaning of course they drive away with him in it. By the time the film’s inevitably sentimental ending arrives, like a splatter of mud from a bucket labelled “Hallmark”, nothing feels earned.On a visual level Buckley’s Chance is also poor: blandly shot with an outback-devouring lens that’s neither hot and gluggy, like Wake in Fright, nor crisp and airy, like The Dry. The film is like one of those old, bad Disney dramas nobody remembers, in which everything feels fake – even real outdoors sets, as if nature itself has been hoisted upon a soundstage. Nighy’s accent is just one aspect of that fakeness. To cleanse the palette afterwards, I rewatched him singing “Christmas is all around me” from Love Actually. Buckley’s Chance is in Australian cinemas now"
Good on Paper review – Netflix dating comedy is OK on screen,"Comedian Iliza Shlesinger turns a true story from her dating life into an intermittently entertaining, if inconsequential, movie",2,"It would perhaps be overly generous to say that the Netflix dating caper Good on Paper was itself an embodiment of its title but pre-release there were enough reasons to at least label it “fine on paper”, a welcome addition to the streamer’s growing sub-genre of female-fronted, and created, comedies. First, and what’s often most depressingly appealing these days about a Netflix “original” is that it was produced by an actual studio before being acquired (in this instance, Universal), gracing it with the feel and aesthetic of a genuine movie. Second, it’s based on a true story from comedian Iliza Shlesinger’s life, one that she’s turned into a script, craftily giving herself her first major lead and also telling a dating story from an authentic place, rather than leaning on a married person’s broad strokes idea of what swiping, flirting and shagging is like in the modern age.Shlesinger’s ferocious, fast-paced brand of comedy, while far from unique, can often be extremely funny, combatting misogynistic ideas of women who don’t “conform” as well as relatable bits on the messier, easily judged ways we often act in relationships. Elements translate well to a film about dating, something she discusses in great length on stage, but not quite well enough, given how specific and hilarious she can be in her standup, the film often feeling a bit beige and shapeless in comparison. Shlesinger plays Andrea, a fictional version of herself, a single comic who ends up dating and sleeping with hot, but lightweight, guys with names like Kaden. On a flight home one day, she encounters Dennis (Ryan Hansen), a nerdy but friendly co-passenger, who is nothing she would usually go for (physically, she compares him to “an accountant who loves missionary”). They became fast friends and eventually it turns into something more but Andrea starts realising (along with help from her friend, an under-utilised Margaret Cho) that Dennis might not be the person he says he is.The story that Good on Paper is based on (Shlesinger says the film is about two-thirds accurate), is one that’s been told on both Joe Rogan’s podcast as well as during a Comedy Central special and it’s the kind of endless “and then” tale that would have you gripped if it was being shared with you in person. On screen it’s a little less effective, mostly because in trying to force it into the structure of a broad comedy, it loses some of its edge. Shlesinger’s comedy also gets a little too smoothed out in the process, the film playing it safe when we want it to run wild. There are brief flashes but nothing gets close to watching her on stage, where she has the freedom to go further, to risk more, a freewheeling thrill to watch in her funniest, darkest moments.The plot is spliced with moments from her standup, a la Seinfeld, which again aren’t as funny as they should be, but do provide some of the film’s more acute observations such as a bit about how a singleton is told to feel grateful after a certain age for getting the bare minimum, as if something bad is still better than nothing. Shlesinger has said in interviews that she was keen to grace her character with a certain sense of togetherness that she often feels is missing from female leads in comedies, who are fuckups in a way that feels over-egged and reductive. And that she does, tidily avoiding certain cliches and conventions (unlike Amy Schumer’s Trainwreck there’s not a whiff of the conservative slut-shaming that ultimately tanked that movie), but we still don’t know her quite well enough and it’s too hard to understand why she would fall for someone who is such a flashing assemblage of bright red flags. A lot of this is down to Hansen’s performance, which is far too broad, as if he just walked on set from a TBS sitcom that was cancelled in the 2000s, never convincing us that he’s someone who could attract anyone, let alone a self-assured, smart comedian.It all goes off the rails in the worst way in the chaotic final act, as Shlesinger invents a farcical, and increasingly ludicrous, way to wrap things up, the truth of what happened proving far too pedestrian for the framework she’s created. It feels at times that in tying herself to this particular anecdote, she’s a little hampered, and one can foresee a better project for her as an actor and a writer somewhere in the future, something that’s both good on paper and on screen.Good on Paper is available on Netflix from 23 June This article was amended on 24 June 2021 to correct the spelling of Iliza Shlesinger’s surname."
Sherni review – Vidya Balan joins the hunt for a man-eating tiger,"Balan excels as a resolute forest officer battling sexism and corruption, as well as nature, in the latest satirical thriller from Newton director Amit V Masurkar",3,"After the success of his 2017 political black comedy Newton, director Amit V Masurkar once again aims to shed light on India’s contemporary social issues. Ostensibly a thriller, Sherni tackles sexism and the absurdities of bureaucracy, all in relation to the age-old conflict between man and nature.The title, which means “tigress” in Hindi, refers not only to the wandering animal at the centre of the film’s clashes but also the protagonist, forest officer Vidya Vincent (Vidya Balan). A taciturn government worker, Vidya’s fierceness shows itself in her astonishing resilience: determined to capture the man-eating tiger alive, she rails against her uncaring, opportunistic superiors and the local politicians who use the animal to incite villagers to violence. In the end, Vidya’s compassion bucks against an incendiary, bloodthirsty hunter who only wants the poor beast dead.Balan excels here with a subtle performance that avoids platitudinous girl-power poses. Underneath Vidya’s quiet exterior is a resolute refusal to cower to authority, and thus, when she hits a roadblock in her quest, the slightest crack in her composure feels shattering.Masurkar’s signature dark humour is in evidence in visual details: Vidya’s boss, for instance, has a gigantic photo of a tiger in his office, but is completely oblivious to the specificities of conservation work. But unlike with Newton, Masurkar is credited for co-writing the dialogue but not the full screenplay, and perhaps this is why Sherni lacks the mathematical exactness of Newton’s satire.In fact, the film operates much like the roaming tiger, meandering from political commentary to a study of women in a male-dominated field. These are important issues, but Sherni reiterates near-identical scenes of confrontation without delving into their causes, thus wasting the excellent cast of veteran character actors. Still, this is an engaging excursion into the trials and tribulations of environmental conservation, which rarely get fictionalised on screen. Sherni is released on 18 June on Amazon Prime Video."
"Homeward review – newborn lambs, Thalys babies and Kurdish folk songs","Mournful themes dominate in this varied collection of short documentaries, the most compelling of which follows those deported from Britain to Jamaica",4,"This collection of short films from the online documentary platform True Story has home and exile as its central themes – though the needle errs towards the latter across these five often mournful works.The longest, at 37 minutes, Rebecca Achieng Ajulu-Bushell’s Breakfast in Kisumu is a seemingly affable conversation with her Kenyan father, Rok Ajulu, as he recounts his 20-year odyssey from being a student in Bulgaria to academia in the UK and pan-African activism in Lesotho and beyond. But it becomes clear that he sacrificed family for the collective political struggle, and this is his estranged daughter’s attempt at recovering their relationship and her Luo heritage. Ajulu-Bushell collages their conversation with scraps of archival and found-style footage, but flips into a sobering formalism for a soothing final rapprochement with father, who died in 2016.There’s a Loachian weight to Hydebank, directed by Ross McClean, in which toughness and tenderness butt heads in a young offenders’ prison in Northern Ireland. Ryan is serving a 10-year sentence for an unspecified violent crime – one which, judging by the level of remorse he expresses, was pretty violent indeed. But he finds solace in looking after the institution’s flock of sheep, something that enrages some of other prisoners, who scream “sheep-shagger” over the walls. As we watch Ryan deliver, suckle and groom the lambs, among these uncompromising animal realities is the possibility of connection, love and redemption. Shot in stark floodlit compositions, all of life seems to be inside this paddock.“Thalys babies”, conceived via medically assisted procreation in Belgium for single or lesbian French woman barred from such procedures by law in their own country, are the subject of Charlotte Müller’s No Man’s Land. Accompanying these biological wayfarers on the Paris-Brussels Thalys express train (hence the name), she lingers on their trepidation and solitude. But there’s a vagueness to the film – it’s not immediately clear that Müller is herself one of the women depicted – which is presumably meant to mesh these experiences into a universal condition, but which somehow holds us at a distance.Bircan Birol’s My Name is Anik is, like Breakfast in Kisumu, is another crosscultural recovery mission but this time one conducted with tetchy humour. The Scottish-based, Turkish-speaking director returns to Istanbul to learn Kurdish from her grandmother. Birol sees it as a way of continuing a legacy; her elder questions what future use it could have. Insisting on being buried with childhood locks of Birol’s hair she has kept, brought to tears by Kurdish folk songs, the grandmother’s heart is in the past. The pair end up squabbling on a park bench. A mnemonic Post-it with “dolap” (cupboard) written on it falls off. The takeaway: language, and culture, don’t stick where you want them to.Most compelling of the crop is Motherland, a heartbreaking set of interviews by Ellen Evans with black Britons either deported back to Jamaica or, in the case of one Windrusher, refused re-entry to Britain. Brisk sweeps of their new surroundings – an abandoned fort, chaotic Kingston streets, spartan living rooms – sum up the cultural alienation and depression the UK’s new immigration regime has foisted on them. One young Mancunian in exile says: “I served my prison sentence, my full time … and one day they came for me and said: ‘You’re going.’ Just like that.”. Make no mistake: this is incarceration, too. Homeward is released on 18 June on True Story."
Salaam Bombay! review – still fiercely unsentimental and throbbing with energy,"The re-release of Mira Nair’s unflinching 1988 story of street children, prostitutes and drug dealers shows it has lost none of its power",4,"Mira Nair’s Salaam Bombay! from 1988 was developed through journalistic research into the street children of Mumbai with her screenwriting partner Sooni Taraporevala; now it is re-released and what strikes you is not simply its energy and vitality and its Dickensian storytelling appetite, but its fierce unsentimentality. This is a movie that withholds the resolution for which the audience might find itself longing, showing only how street children cannot imagine their own future as street adults, seeing only imprisonment or death. I found myself contrasting Garth Davis’s recent film Lion from 2017, about the true story of a street kid who fell asleep on a train and finds himself transported thousands of miles away to Kolkata without any means of getting back or explaining to the uncaring officialdom what has happened. That movie was able to offer us a happy ending. Salaam Bombay! can’t and won’t.The beginning is not so very different. Krishna, later to be nicknamed Chaipau (played by non-professional Shafiq Syed) has been working in a circus to pay off a family debt; when the cruel owner sends him to buy three cans of food, poor Krishna returns to finds the circus gone: just a bare patch of land where the big tent was. It’s a stunningly bleak image which, in its way, governs Chaipau’s worldview for the rest of the film. With what little money he has, he buys a train ticket to Bombay (Mumbai), where his three cans are of course immediately stolen.He gets a job selling tea in the red light district, where he befriends Manju (Hansa Vithal), the daughter of prostitute Rekha (Anita Kanwar) and her pimp Baba (Nana Patekar), who employs another, older street kid Chillum (Raghuvir Yadav), to sell drugs – to which he is himself hopelessly addicted. Chaipau is to fall gallantly and platonically in love with another prostitute, nicknamed Sweet Sixteen (Chandra Sharma). A young Irrfan Khan has a cameo as a letter writer. Inevitably, both Chaipau and Manju find themselves institutionalised: respectively in a boys’ juvenile hall and a girls’ detention centre, where Rekha and Baba are brusquely told that their daughter will be taken away from them. And of course the state, which had seemed utterly absent from the first half of the film, now appears in its most authoritarian form: police, jailers and child services.And what is happening in Chaipau’s home village? That supposed paradise, for which Chaipau is trying to save up money for a ticket home, is utterly absent. It was his family’s dour attitude to money that got him into this mess in the first place. Mumbai is the only universe, and for all its immensity and crowds, it is a tiny and lonely place that gets tinier and lonelier all the time. Yet this doesn’t stop the pulse of energy throbbing out of the screen. Salaam Bombay! is released on 21 June on digital platforms."
Fatherhood review – Kevin Hart Netflix drama is manipulative reputation rehab,The comedian gives a false dramatic performance as a saintly father coping with his daughter’s gender non-conforming behavior in a calculated new film,2,"In December 2018, Kevin Hart landed himself in a maelstrom of negative PR that he just couldn’t make subside. Scoring the high-profile gig of Academy Awards telecast host placed him under a greater scrutiny, which led to the exhuming of a bitterly homophobic backlog from earlier in the decade, spanning tweets describing a guy’s photo as “a gay bill board [sic] for AIDS” and an extended run in his Seriously Funny standup special about how he’d try to “prevent” his own son from being gay. For all the furor these remarks provoked, the comedian was resolute in his refusal to own up to them, offering “I think we love to make big deals out of things that aren’t necessarily big deals, because we can” as a halfhearted mea culpa in a 2015 Rolling Stone profile. As the controversy surrounding his selection as Oscars emcee rolled into its third day, Hart declared in a video that “I chose to pass, I passed on the apology” when the Academy requested a formal declaration of contrition. One month later, however, Hart’s agents got him in as Channing Tatum’s replacement on the in-development Fatherhood.After exactly six premiere date postponements delaying the release over a year, during which Sony quietly pawned the distribution rights off on Netflix, that film arrives online this week. The adaptation of Two Kisses for Maddy: A Memoir of Loss and Love seems to exist mostly for the purpose of serving the public an image of a softer, more caring Hart. Like the source book’s author, his character Matt must contend with the unimaginable hardship of losing his wife mere hours after she gave birth to their first child. While shouldering a deep and lasting grief, he takes it upon himself to keep doctor’s appointments and change the diapers and create a nurturing home for little Maddy. He’s not the perfect dad – though that’s true only in understandable, forgivable ways, like struggling to wrangle hair into braids or momentarily forgetting the carrier in a parking lot – but he’s doing his best to figure out this grand, scary adventure called parenthood.That Hart would want to be portrayed as a kind, patient man at this particular juncture of his career makes sense, and his possible ulterior motives don’t even feel all that intrusive on the agreeably low-key melodrama, until that behind-the-scenes context crosses the line from canny casting to manipulation. While the memoir’s scope doesn’t extend past the newborn’s first year of life, the screen version time-jumps ahead to Maddy’s school-aged enrollment at a well-regarded Catholic academy. Having gained a sense of herself, she’s started experimenting with gender non-conforming behavior, insisting on underwear marketed to boys and wearing slacks for her school uniform instead of the young ladies’ mandated skirt. As Matt, Hart gets the chance to field this perfectly, so supportive and open-minded that he’ll even wear a skirt to a morning drop-off just to prove it to the nuns. This fake gesture scans as an effort to shift real-world perception of his celebrity, the A-lister vanity project (Hart also came on as a producer when he signed on the dotted line) elevated to the level of pure reputational rehab.With anyone else in the lead, the paternal devotion would be an easier sell, and the film itself could be more innocently enjoyable. Paul Weitz, the director, exercises the same sense of relative restraint on the sap factor that brought his 2002 film About a Boy awards attention and a blockbusting box office, stopping short of any heavy-duty misery. Scenes of adults conversing about adult matters, the province of the quickly vanishing mid-budget star vehicle, play out believably and naturally. As Matt’s self-effacing work buddy and his possible re-entrée to the dating world, Anthony Carrigan and DeWanda Wise respectively lend a comfortable confidence to their stock roles. There’s an overall sturdiness to the construction rare among middlebrow family pictures, usually so quick to dissolve into a viscous mess of melted sugar.Hart comports himself with a more dialed-back version of the jittery everyman affability he’s developed over decades in the comedy circuit, a schtick that reads as just that – a pose, a well-honed affectation. There is an immense and documentable falseness at the core of his performance that drags down the salvageable movie all around it, far from the redemption arc clincher his handlers may have had in mind. The opportunistic timing drains the soulfulness from his impression of a tolerant father figure, and even the charitable interpretation that he’s taken on this job as a step on the path to making good doesn’t ring true. Anyone familiar enough with Hart’s media missteps knows that an earnest, unequivocal sorry isn’t in his nature. As he declared just earlier this week in an interview with the Times that saw him denounce cancel culture: “If somebody has done something truly damaging then, absolutely, a consequence should be attached,” Hart said. “But when you just talk about … nonsense? When you’re talking, ‘Someone said! They need to be taken [down]!’ Shut the fuck up!”Fatherhood is available on Netflix from 18 June"
Nobody review – Bob Odenkirk is a blast in action man mode,The Better Call Saul star is perfectly cast as a downtrodden everyman who discovers his inner vigilante after his home is burgled,4,"Bob Odenkirk, best known for playing a gutter lawyer in Better Call Saul, is not the first name that springs to mind to claim the aggrieved everyman action slot recently vacated by Liam Neeson. But from the opening shot – battered face cross-hatched with scratches, shackled hands effortlessly snapping open a Zippo lighter – the question is not the casting, but what took Hollywood so long to weaponise the ineffable coolness of Odenkirk.He plays Hutch Mansell, a sad sack number-cruncher at his father-in-law’s factory and husband adrift from his distant wife (Connie Nielsen). Snappy editing gives a flick-book summary of the daily disappointments of Hutch’s life and Russian director Ilya Naishuller combines a showily kinetic verve with a crackle of wry humour.When thieves break into his home, Hutch chooses de-escalation rather than baseball bat retaliation - the right thing to do - but he feels himself diminished in the eyes of his family. The event awakens something within him, but it’s the realisation that the thieves stole his daughter’s kitty-cat bracelet that unleashes a long dormant lust for justice (deployed with knives, guns, grenades, fire extinguishers and his pensioner dad, sprung from the retirement home and armed to the dentures).Hutch finds a worthy adversary in “connected, funded sociopath” Yulian (Aleksey Serebryakov), a Russian in a shiny suit that looks like it was flayed from a live shark. And if this all sounds a little John Wick-a-like, that’s perhaps to be expected – the films share a writer in Derek Kolstad, Hollywood’s go-to guy for crazy-violent, hyper-adrenalised popcorn thrills. It’s a blast."
Don’t Look Back review – smartphone morality shocker fails to connect,The undoing of a group of ‘bad Samaritans’ has none of the ghoulish fun you might expect from the maker of Final Destination,2,"There was something almost camp about death in the Final Destination series, the invisible hand that toyed with us as it liquidated its characters. Franchise originator Jeffrey Reddick tries to recapture that high-concept magic in his directorial debut Don’t Look Back, also about a lethal force stalking a group bound by calamity. But here he bleaches it of humour and adds a nagging moralistic component – possibly with an eye on the faith-movie market.This time, karma is the invisible antagonist stalking six “bad Samaritans”, who fail to intervene – one committing the cardinal sin and whipping out his smartphone instead – when a local philanthropist gets beaten up at the park. But for Caitlin (Kourtney Bell) her paralysis has personal reasons: it triggers flashbacks to the recent home invasion in which her father was killed. Not that that excuse placates the victim’s brother, Lucas (Will Stout), and hostile public opinion. When one of the group makes a sudden upper-storey window exit, there seems to be some supernatural Jeremy Kyle coming to pass judgment on them all – or so Caitlin believes.With Don’t Look Back very much feeling like a ropey first draft of Final Destination, Reddick’s gimmick here is fuzzy compared to the franchise’s ruthless focus on the feasibility of outsmarting death. In Don’t Look Back, Reddick tries to set Caitlin a similar fiendish brainteaser, rooted in serial appearances of the number 27, but it is thin gruel plot-wise. The least we can ask for are some virtuoso demises – but with the film only half-heartedly invested in the inter-group dynamics and the individual stakes involved, they are disappointingly vanilla and unimpactful when they come. Karma, it seems, operates mostly by unlucky falls.It’s simpler for Don’t Look Back to preach fire and brimstone on the smartphone dilemma – which, when virtually everyone in the digital age is guilty of voyeurism to some degree, feels rather early-2000s and un-nuanced. The directing is serviceable, but some rote imagery – especially the ominous crow of death – also likes to hit us over the head. Reddick should have concentrated on giving the characters that kind of treatment. Don’t Look Back is release on digital platforms on 14 June."
Shock Wave: Hong Kong Destruction review – one long tick-tick-boom symphony,"Andy Lau plays a bomb-disposal officer in this old-school action thriller with tricksy, Infernal Affairs-esque storytelling ",2,"The “2” in the original title of this film would suggest this Hong Kong-action thriller is a sequel – or more likely a prequel given its ending – to the 2017 film Shock Wave, which like this starred megastar Andy Lau and was directed by one of his regular collaborators, Herman Yau. In fact, there’s no connective narrative tissue at all between the films, apart from the fact that the hero in both works for the Hong Kong police department’s Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) bureau, or bomb disposal unit. Still, the end result offers a regular drumbeat of suspense-followed-by-explosion throughout – one long tick-tick-boom symphony, in fact – which makes for fitfully stimulating entertainment.Lau plays Poon Sing-fung, the EOD’s most reckless yet heroic debomber, who is best friends with his superior, Tung (Ching Wan Lau), and in a happy romantic relationship with pretty police officer Pong Ling (Ni Ni). The couple’s happiness is mostly represented in the early scenes by her looking simperingly at him while he laughs in a reckless yet heroic fashion. But one call-out goes wrong, and just when Poon thinks he’s saved everyone in a squalid flat, a cat in a booby-trapped microwave blows up and Poon loses half of his left leg. Nevertheless, he puts everything into building up strength in his remaining limbs in order to return to his old job, which not so coincidentally dovetails with Lau’s real-world support for the Paralympics and disabled athletes.Then the movie rapidly gets much more tricksy in its storytelling: a group of terrorists called Vendetta are sifted into the mix; they are led by a white-haired Julian Assange-like leader (Tse Kwan-Ho) and are hellbent on blowing stuff up and getting revenge for past slights. Has Poon, like Lau’s character in Infernal Affairs (the model for The Departed), been a mole all this time in the terrorist organisation? Or is he a mole posing as a mole? A bad case of post-traumatic amnesia Poon suffers after yet another explosion means even he doesn’t know which side he used to be on, or which one he wants to be on now.It’s all a bit otiose and a little stale, especially all the ersatz medical talk about brain injuries. Despite a few modish touches, this feels fundamentally very old-school, and not necessarily in a good way, right down to the repeated shots of people running away from fireballs in the background. Shock Wave: Hong Kong Destruction is released on 14 June on digital platforms."
The Hitman’s Wife’s Bodyguard review – Ryan Reynolds back in a tiresome sequel,"Reynolds returns as bodyguard Michael Bryce, with Samuel L Jackson as an assassin, Salma Hayek as his badass wife and Antonio Banderas as a Greek supervillain. Please stop",2,"Here’s the tiresome follow-up to the tiresome action comedy with the tiresomely (and unfunnily) muddled premise: bodyguards generally protect people against hitmen and hitmen generally don’t need bodyguards as they’re not publicly visible … but that wasn’t the point. Anyway, here’s the sequel with the extra-clumsy double-possessive in the title.Ryan Reynolds is back as Michael Bryce, the former triple-A rated bodyguard, now haunted and traumatised by his professional failures, and by his association with the notorious assassin Darius Kincaid, played by Samuel L Jackson. Michael is stripped of his “licence” to practise bodyguarding and is now in therapy; but just as he decides to take a restorative European break by the pool, Michael gets sucked right back into the melee by Kincaid’s badass wife Sonia, in which role Salma Hayek is once again phoning in her hellcat routine. So the wacky trio are back together again, Reynolds getting whatever laugh lines there are going, as he is bemused and depressed by the situation that this couple have put him in, though not as bemused and depressed as all of us in the audience.They find themselves up against Greek supervillain Aristotle Papadopoulous, played by Antonio Banderas with such an uncompromising refusal to do a Greek accent that at first I thought it had to be some kind of gag. The idea is that he will use a super-strong drill to damage the underwater junction box that holds the data for the European Union’s computer systems, as a revenge for the EU beating up on his home country. (This would have been topical around the time of the “Grexit” row of 2012.) So we have loads of Euro-locations and loads of car chase scenes through picturesque tourist cities, with cars lumbering down crumbling stone steps and at one stage even smashing through the traditional fruit-stall. There are also some weirdly pedantic references to the Goldie Hawn comedy Overboard, perhaps to pre-empt objections to possible plot-borrowings.To add to all his anxieties, Michael is also afflicted by feelings of inferiority in comparison with his stepfather, a legendary veteran bodyguard: a great big comedy cameo for a big name who is entirely wasted in the part. There are some almost-laughs here and there, but please tell me that we aren’t in for The Hitman’s Mother-In-Law’s Agent’s Bodyguard in 2023. The Hitman’s Wife’s Bodyguard is released on 18 June in cinemas."
Sunflowers review – an intricate portrait of Van Gogh’s iconic series,"Intimate letters, record-breaking sales and the world of competitive gardening paint a fascinating picture of the story behind Vincent’s floral masterpieces",3,"Not surprisingly, Vincent van Gogh has proved a rich seam for the Exhibition on Screen gallery series, with one of the most commercially potent of modern painters providing material for previous films including Van Gogh in Japan and Van Gogh: A New Way of Seeing. Here, the attention is even more micro, though hardly niche: the series of sunflower studies Van Gogh painted in 1888 and 1889, one of which went on to command a record auction price in the mid 1980s and practically on its own send the art market into the financial stratosphere.Super-familiar though the sunflower paintings may be, this film does a pretty good job of drilling down through the intricacies of the series, from Van Gogh’s earlier “Paris” set, and then the seven pictures he painted in Arles, which provide varying versions of the famous flower-vase arrangement. The film takes us carefully through each of the pictures, showing them in situ and giving the curators the chance to chat, rather like the epic Leonardo tour the same producers released in 2019. This film, though, has the chance to dwell a little longer, sketching in biographical information and offering readings from Van Gogh’s own letters to fill out the artist’s thinking. There’s also an interesting insight into the “competitive gardening” of the era, and the sunflower’s place in it: Oxford University’s Stephen Harris offers a more enthusiastic explainer than you normally get in films like this.Director-producer team David Bickerstaff and Phil Grabsky are past masters at putting this kind of film together, and Sunflowers has the usual mix of smoothly impressive visuals and authoritatively informed comment. The analysis focuses mostly on Van Gogh’s artistic and creative decisions; given that this was such a tumultuous period for his mental health (including the notorious ear-cutting incident after rowing with his houseguest Paul Gauguin), I would have liked to hear more on how it may or may not have fed into the work. Be that as it may, this is a good option for those who are not quite ready to brave the museum, and prefer to try a little cinema-based social distancing instead. Sunflowers is released on 8 June in cinemas."
Gunda review – immersive pig’s-eye view,Russian film-maker Viktor Kosakovskiy offers a fascinatingly close focus on farm animals in this detailed documentary,3,"A sow and her litter of adorable piglets are the subject of this memorable documentary from Russian director Viktor Kosakovskiy (Aquarela), executive produced by Joaquin Phoenix. Kosakovskiy doesn’t attempt to assume the point of view of the pigs, but for 90 minutes he lives among them, his camera taking up residence inside their barn and roaming their pasture at eye level. He also visits and observes their neighbours, including a tentative flock of chickens and a herd of stoic dairy cows. There is no narration, no subtitles and no musical score but, instead, an immersive soundscape of farmyard grunts and squelches.To call the film meditative would be to undersell Kosakovskiy’s instinct for drama and tension. The director gravitates towards runts and stragglers, such as a piglet buried beneath a pile of hay and unceremoniously crushed by its mother. A one-legged chicken is treated with similar reverence. The crisp black and white digital cinematography emphasises the piglets’ downy fur, sleepy eyes and softly rising bellies. It’s an encouragement to acknowledge the beauty, texture and aliveness of the animals. Less successful is the invitation to project interiority on to the creatures’ inscrutable faces – the way the camera fixes on a cow’s intense stare, for example, feels like a call to imbue its gaze with emotional significance."
The Killing of Two Lovers review – heartbreaking separation drama,An air of tension hangs over this rural Utah-set tale of a husband struggling with losing his wife,4,"A striking opening scene sees David (Clayne Crawford) pointing a gun at his sleeping wife. Whether or not he’ll snap hangs over the remainder of this lean, stylish and frequently heartbreaking drama set in rural Utah, against a backdrop of Parma Violet skies. Crawford is brilliant and bitter as a soon-to-be divorced dad unable to accept his fate. The recurring sound of a car door slamming haunts the film, the ghost of a car-bound confrontation between David and Nikki (Sepideh Moafi). Though they are oceans apart emotionally, the scene plays out entirely in closeup. In cinemas and exclusively on Curzon Home Cinema"
Dream Horse review – hope and hwyl in a one-horse town,It takes a Welsh village to breed a winning sprinter in this feelgood comedy starring Toni Collette,3,"“£300? Could’ve gone to Benidorm for that,” scoffs Brian (Owen Teale). His overworked and underappreciated wife, Jan (Toni Collette, luminous and easy to root for), has spent 300 quid on a mare with a syndicate of locals, hoping to breed a racehorse to compete with the best. It’s a wise investment, as Dream Alliance turns out to be a winner and a symbol of hope in Cefn Fforest, an economically depressed former mining village in Wales. But they’re not doing it for the money – it’s for the “hwyl”, a Welsh word meaning “emotional motivation and energy”. With its hero’s journey structure, punchily edited racing scenes and warmly drawn oddball community (a widow, Maureen, is obsessed with Tunnock’s Tea Cakes), the film is shamelessly predictable and thoroughly feelgood."
Knots: A Forced Marriage Story review – bleak overview of marital coercion in America,"Judging by the harrowing testimonies in Kate Ryan Brewer’s documentary, the US legal system offers little protection for teenage women pushed to marry against their will",3,"There’s no rosy nostalgia to the wedding photos featured in Knots: A Forced Marriage Story, a 75-minute documentary written and directed by Kate Ryan Brewer that calls attention to the disturbingly few barriers against coerced marriage in the US. In succinct and gnawing first-person interviews, three women detail how intense parental pressure, teenage gullibility and isolation forced them into marriage with people they barely knew. There’s Nina van Harn, raised in the fundamentalist Christian patriarchy movement in rural western Michigan and married at 19 to a man selected by her father; Sara Tasneem, married at 15 to a 28-year-old stranger by her father; and Fraidy Reiss, paired by an Orthodox Jewish matchmaker in Brooklyn at 19.Along with the three women’s personal testimonies of coercion, confusion, shattered breaking points and eventual escape (all through arduous divorce proceedings), Knots weaves in bits of legal and historical context for a deeply troubling portrait of archaic marriage laws in the US. As the film points out, 48 states allow marriage for those under 18 through various exceptions, while 13 states have no age minimums for marriage at all.It’s a bleak picture, enhanced by Miriam Mayer’s spare, ominous score and recurring shots of a stirring dance performance by Bella Waru. Both gesture to the desperation, fear and anguish felt by the narrators, especially in regards to sexual trauma, which is referred to openly but not discussed in great detail. The spectre of coerced consummation is harrowing enough; Sara, at 15, was so unaware of what marriage entailed that she remembers asking her adult escorts to the wedding where she’d be sleeping that night.Knots is a straightforward advocacy film, and that’s fine: you don’t need cinematic bells and whistles to marvel at the women’s astounding resilience, or writhe at the gaslighting lines about honour, duty, and respect they were fed for years. There’s little faith to be found in the US political system, which has been slow to enact child marriage protections, but Knots offers three testaments to the human spirit, and the ability to start anew. Knots: A Forced Marriage Story is released on 4 June on digital platforms."
Felix and the Hidden Treasure – family animation flounders as satire,A boy searches for his father in a decent-looking adventure that ditches that narrative for a kid-unfriendly one about a cult ,2,"This is a semi-entertaining, reasonably decent family animation that begins promisingly with a swell of adventure as a young boy sets sail in a boat in search of his missing dad. But after a couple of hastily resolved peril-at-sea moments (“We’re done for! We’re saved!”) the script lurches into a bizarrely un-childfriendly storyline about a secretive cult.The boy is 12-year-old Felix (nicely voiced by Daniel Brochu), who lives in Quebec’s Magdalen Islands with his mum and little sister. Two years earlier, his fisherman dad was lost at sea. Any hope that he might be alive is long gone, but Felix is determined to search the island where he was last spotted. He ropes in grumpy lighthouse-keeper Tom to help – a real old Captain Birdseye with a bushy beard and eyebrows like furry white caterpillars.There are some gracefully animated scenes as the pair sail off, all glowing sunsets and churning waves. But when they get shipwrecked, it all goes headspinningly wrong. They discover that an evil cult has built an underground city on the island where Felix’s dad went missing. The group’s leader Morgäa (Karine Vanasse), a woman with flicky, over-the-top Real Housewives hair and bling sunglasses, rejects the label “cult”. “The residents come here entirely of their own accord,” she trills. “They’ve adopted a peaceful, sincere lifestyle based on principles of harmony.” This satire of lifestyle gurus here is pretty low on gags, and it’s hard to see how it will connect with younger viewers.The rest of the movie plays out in standard kids’ entertainment frantic mode, the group’s security beefcakes chasing Felix and Tom around, everyone bopping each other on the head. Spoiler alert: Morgäa’s power is linked to immortality; adults get turned into babies, kids are threatened with premature ageing. It’s a neat idea, but the script doesn’t take it anywhere interesting. Felix and the Hidden Treasure is released on 4 June in cinemas."
Land review – Robin Wright heads into the wild for tame drama,The actor makes a muted directorial debut with a conventional film about a woman going off the grid after a devastating tragedy,2,"In Robin Wright’s conventional, competent directorial debut, Land, the actor (who has previously shown adeptness behind the camera for various episodes of House of Cards) takes us somewhere we know a little too well. Edee (played by Wright), is an urban-dwelling woman whose grief has distanced her from society, as grief often does, making her crave solitude, choosing self-inflicted actual loneliness rather than the more uncomfortable alternative – feeling lonely when there are so many others around. So she packs up and moves to a remote cabin in the Rockies, without any way of contacting the outside world, and tries to start a new life, alone.When Jean-Marc Vallée, Reese Witherspoon and Nick Hornby brought Cheryl Strayed’s memoir Wild to the screen back in 2014 (the story of an urban-dwelling woman who travels into the wilderness after a major loss – ding ding ding), there was an acute awareness of the potential familiarity and limitations of the story, of a one-character drama hinged on the restorative power of nature. So Strayed’s experience was adapted with unusual flair in an evocative and immersive film about what it feels like to really be alone, how memories can domino into one another, how a sound can lead to a flash of something horrible or sad or sweet, transforming a theoretically simple trek narrative into a distinctive tapestry of emotion and regret. In Land, Edee isn’t on the move in the way that Cheryl was, but there’s an undeniable feeling of deja vu here (strong hints of Chloé Zhao’s far superior Nomadland also do it absolutely no favours).Wright decides to tell her story in the most straightforward way possible, without any real energy or singular style, relying solely on the barest of bones to keep it all together. As an actor she’s skilled at taking on characters whose restraint hides something more complex but there’s not enough bubbling under the surface in Edee to keep us engaged (she’s defined by her trauma and little else). We know all too well that the tragedy that led her here will be teased with flashbacks and then revealed in an emotional finale (Wright shoots flashbacks as though they belong in an indigestion relief commercial, which is … ineffective). She’s strong enough to make it work for a while (until we realise what little there is to come) and there is a simple sort of satisfaction to watching her grow more accomplished at living in the wild. But we remain vaguely invested because of her commitment as an actor rather than her ability as a director, a dual role made even harder by a mostly rote script from Jesse Chatma and Erin Dignam.For a film that so often chooses quietness over noise, when dialogue does arrive, it’s discordantly heavy-handed (“If I don’t belong here, I don’t belong anywhere,” Edee says with a straight face) and, after a solid start, with the script seemingly sticking to Edee’s dogmatic isolation, a sort of semi-love interest is lazily introduced, played well enough by Demián Bichir. As Edee reaches her low point, in comes a handsome, similarly aged saviour, Miguel (“I can’t take money for doing the right thing,” he tells her, halo out of shot) and their friendship-relationship edges the film into even more mechanical territory – guess who’s also suffering from a great loss?With grief being the driving force of Edee’s character and the film at large, there’s not enough specificity in how it’s experienced or spoken about to fill the empty space, a sort of generic TV movie-level view of how someone processes loss (Tom Geens’ under-seen 2015 drama Couple in a Hole went from a similar starting point but travelled to a far more interesting place). There are stabs at something knottier, such as an all-too-brief discussion about Edee’s privilege (at one moment, Miguel tells her, “Only a person who has never been hungry would think starving is a way to die”) or the repercussions of one’s selfishness (with others forced to step in to help patch up Edee’s half-thought plan) but they don’t lead anywhere substantial or strengthen what’s essentially a character study of a character not really worth studying.There’s stunning scenery throughout Land but it’s sort of a given when shooting in such a beautiful location and Wright never really manages to do anything especially artful with it to distinguish her work, we never really know her as a film-maker as we do as an actor – it’s something that could have been directed by anyone. It’s by no means the disaster it could have been, with history showing us too many actors who’ve tanked on the other side of the camera, but there’s just not enough here to make it a worthwhile retread through familiar territory, proof of Wright’s basic competency as a director but nothing more. At one point, Edee says to Miguel’s dog: “Looks like we’re finally getting the hang of this, huh?” Not quite yet, I’d say.Land is screening at the Sundance film festival and will be released in the US on 12 February, and on 4 June in UK cinemas."
Flashback review – confusing but compelling multiverse thriller,An IT drone’s daily grind meshes with his druggie high-school past in a Canadian brain-teaser that is somewhere between schlock and genius,3,"If Slaughterhouse-Five and Donnie Darko had a baby, and that baby grew up in the 2000s, became a teenager and then developed a bit of a substance abuse problem, went partying with Denis Villeneuve’s Enemy and that Ashton Kutcher movie The Butterfly Effect, developed memory loss and depression, then it might look something like this interesting but rather muddled Canadian science fiction film.Dylan O’Brien, an actor in his late 20s who is fortuitously baby-faced enough to be cast as a high-school senior, stars as Fred, a guy who seems to have come a bit unstuck in time. At first, things seem normal as he goes about his life as an IT office drone, working under tough boss Evelyn (Amanda Brugel, looking more glam here than she usually does in The Handmaid’s Tale) and living with his nice but somewhat dull partner Karen (Hannah Gross). But the increasing dementia of his mother (Liisa Repo-Martell) and memories triggered by old photographs gets Fred thinking about his wild teenage years.Back then, Fred and his buddies did a faddish drug called Mercury, and Fred was crushing on an emo girl named Cindy (Maika Monroe from It Follows) who sat in front of him in maths class. But what seem at first like, per the film’s title, flashbacks turn out to be moments Fred is living in simultaneously. Or maybe they are another type of flashback: hallucinations induced by Mercury. Either way, these visual fragments start to piece together, quite literally, in a near-blur of superfast edits and the nature of Fred’s reality becomes a little clearer.Some viewers may need a second screening or more to work out what the hell is actually going on, especially with the EDM playing in the background in some scenes. Nevertheless, this pulpy multiverse brain-teaser is reasonably compelling to watch – at least in this reality. In another, it’s straight to video garbage, and in yet another, it’s won the Palme d’Or. Flashback is released on 4 June on digital platforms."
Earwig and the Witch review – a disappointing CGI debut for Studio Ghibli,"Gorō Miyazaki’s foray into computer generation, a magical tale of a gleeful brat adopted by a witch, falls far short of Ghibli’s hand-drawn output",2,"Eighty-year-old animation legend Hayao Miyazaki once described computer-generated imagery as “thin, shallow, fake”. Now Studio Ghibli has made its first ever fully CG feature, and it’s, well, erm … The politest thing to say about Earwig and the Witch is that it’s not a patch on Ghibli’s hand-drawn output, with plasticky-looking characters and an aimless plot. More painfully still, the film-maker responsible is Miyazaki’s son, Gorō Miyazaki (who previously directed the pretty decent Tales from Earthsea and From Up on Poppy Hill).To be fair, Earwig was made for Japanese TV, but there are so many echoes here of Ghibli films past that it’s impossible not to compare and despair. Like Howl’s Moving Castle, the script is based on a classic children’s book by Diana Wynne Jones; and just like Kiki’s Delivery Service the heroine is a plucky young witch. It begins on the doorsteps of an English orphanage where baby Earwig is left by her rock star mum along with a note: “Got the other 12 witches all chasing me. I’ll be back for her when I’ve shook them off. It may take years.”The baby is renamed Erica Wig and grows up to be cheerfully brattish, wrapping everyone at the orphanage around her little finger. Unlike the other kids, Erica (voiced by Taylor Henderson) has no intention of being adopted. But one day a gruesome twosome shows up: buxomy blue-haired witch Bella Yaga (Vanessa Marshall) and her bad-tempered fella Mandrake (Richard E Grant). The witch needs a helper with her spells – and puts Erica to work grinding rat bones and picking prickly nettles.There are some nice touches here and there, like the whirling little demons with batwings who are devoted to Mandrake. But the script ignores all the interesting bits of the story – who are the witches chasing Earwig’s mum and how does she shake them off? How does Earwig feel about being abandoned? Since the last Studio Ghibli release five years ago I’ve become a parent. I used to roll my eyes when friends said how much their young kids loved Ghibli films – sceptical that the slow bits and big complicated feelings would keep little ones entertained. Then I saw it first-hand – the dreamy faraway look on my four-year-old’s face watching When Marnie Was There. So this new film is genuinely disappointing.And there’s a while to wait yet for the latest from Miyazaki Sr. Sixty animators are currently working – by hand, naturally – at a rate of one-minute of animation a month on his new film. Speaking last year, a producer said they have 36 minutes in the bag with three years to go. Earwig and the Witch is released on 28 May in cinemas."
Skull: The Mask review – a masterclass in over-the-top butchery,"An ancient demonic skull mask wreaks havoc on São Paulo in a plot almost as messy as the omnipresent, scene-stealing gore",3,"Anyone who wanted more of the human-sacrifice scene in Mel Gibson’s Apocalypto will be overjoyed by this silly, uneven but strangely appealing slasher film that leaves no heart unripped from human thorax. A mystifying prologue sees Nazis unearth a grotesque pre-Colombian skull mask, which looks like Darth Maul’s Sunday best. The artefact resurfaces in modern-day São Paulo where, after chewing up the archaeologist who found it, it attaches itself to one of the crime-scene cleaners. He is transformed into a host for Anhangá, an indigenous demon who loves an old-school blood sacrifice.Here’s hoping the actor in the mask (Brazilian wrestler Rurik Jr) didn’t make any earnest thespian inquiries about Anhangá’s motivation, because this is a tough one to answer. It’s hinted he’s on a lumbering journey towards a church where a rival god’s femur is kept; Manco (Wilton Andrade) – a fruit-seller who is also part of some ancient order – is determined to intervene. Also following the entrails is detective Beatriz (Natallia Rodrigues), who is blackmailed into cooperating with a gaunt corporate CEO (Ivo Müller) planning to use the mask in a ritual involving abducted Bolivian children.By the time Anhangá is making carpaccio of a nightclub full of ravers, it’s clear his motivation is really to provide steady employment for Brazil’s practical-effects artists. This, in fact, is co-director Kapel Furman’s background – and, from scooped-out torsos to the vine-like appendages writhing around the killer’s body, he undeniably delivers.The profusion of plot strands is almost as messy as the omnipresent innards – and any intended social comment about the influence of Brazilian plutocrats gets lost down there. But, while it lacks focus, there’s a rude vigour about Skull: The Mask, which has as many passages of exciting film-making as amateurish ones. The exploitation film-style prologue suggests Machete on a South American holiday, and the directors use drones and digital shooting to skilfully scope out the concrete spaces of the climax. The butchery is interspersed with eerie inserts – blood welling up inside a chalice, for example – that grasp at a more mystical tone than elsewhere. A surprisingly vibrant addition to the charnel house. Skull: The Mask is on Shudder."
Blue Miracle review – Netflix fishing tale is a surprise charmer,The true story of an orphanage entering into a fishing tournament makes for a conventional yet effective carbon copy of the Disney sports movie formula,3,"Despite the broad crowd-alluring appeal of many of Blue Miracle’s ingredients (a beautiful warm location, sweeping cinematography of a crisp blue ocean, a struggling orphanage packed with cute, quippy kids, an intense competition, Dennis Quaid in a vest), there’s something pretty brave about trying to copy the Disney sports movie formula but replacing baseball or ice hockey with … fishing.It’s not the easiest sell for anyone who isn’t glued to the World Fishing Network (1997’s Gone Fishin’ made a loss of more than $30m) and it’s perhaps one of the reasons why the film was ultimately sold to Netflix, a safe space for precarious box office risks. But even for those whose only memory of staring at water with a rod in hand is one of cold, crushing boredom (I speak from glum experience), it’s a slick little crowd-pleaser and one that could have charmed and cheered an audience of all ages if they were somehow convinced to go see it. It’ll hopefully find its way to people at home, in among the flotsam, and while it’s unlikely to lead to a fishing boom (for many practical reasons, this is not going to do for the sport what The Queen’s Gambit did for chess) it does a surprisingly effective job at making us care what’s on the end of the line.It’s based on the under-reported story of an orphanage in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, that was struggling for money even before the devastating Hurricane Odile in 2014. Finances then went from bad to impossible, causing Omar (Jimmy Gonzales) to do something he hates: ask for help. In the film he finds himself at the local headquarters of Bisbee’s, a company known for its high-stakes fishing tournaments. Also affected by the hurricane, they decide to waive fees for local fishermen in order to ensure the competition still takes place as semi-normal. Omar is forced into teaming up with grizzled two-time winner Wade (Quaid), who reluctantly lets him and some of the kids on the boat, aiming for the $250,000 prize.Directed by Julio Quintana, a mentee and collaborator of Terrence Malick, Blue Miracle might not be what one expects from that description (it’s a proudly mainstream 95-minute family movie) but it does possess the vague remnants of that relationship. Within the constraints of his straightforward material, Quintana demonstrates a visual language that speaks less to his inexperience as a director (it’s only his second film) and more to his master tutelage, first with the lived-in neon-hued streets of the town but then, most obviously, with the remarkable vistas surrounding it as we head out on the water. The scale of the film separates it from the majority of the streamer’s often pedestrian originals, transporting us in a way that helps distract from some of the more rote moments.Quintana and co-writer Craig Dowling’s script is formula 101, without a beat you won’t see coming, and while it mostly goes down well enough, there are a few character shifts that feel a little overly expedited, some emotional wins that feel unearned, and while the predictable finale is undeniably rousing, it moves us enough to feel a little jolted by the abruptness with which it then ends. Gonzales makes for a charming lead, a warm, paternal foil to Quaid’s grumpy captain and absent father, the two wrestling with opposing definitions of masculinity and how to properly teach young boys without parents how to process hardship and competition. Quaid has been leaning into his age of late as he edges toward his 70s, after playing a get-off-my-lawn psycho in The Intruder, and he makes for an effective grouch here, his elder years suggesting Eastwood-lite character work to come.As his walls lower and his cynicism softens, it’s likely that many viewers will find themselves similarly unguarded, the comforting waves of the story lulling us into submission. It’s the sort of old-fashioned string-puller that when done well is hard to resist even if we know the strings are being pulled, like we’re aware of the bait but powerless to resist.Blue Miracle is available on Netflix from 27 May"
Dinner in America review – quirky couple take a trip through suburbia ,A troubled punk singer and his biggest fan get into a series of scrapes in Adam Rehmeier’s likable indie dramedy,3,"“Is weird cool?” “In your case, no.” This pert exchange summarises the style of writer-director Adam Rehmeier’s indie dramedy, with two very good lead performers whose unexpected chemistry gradually makes this film likable. It’s about an angry punk singer with a pyromania fetish and a lonely and nerdy young woman with ADHD who is his biggest fan.Kyle Gallner plays John Q Public (real name: Simon), the lead singer of a band called Psy Ops who performs anonymously in a balaclava; off-stage, he has a vocal-fry badass voice, like Ray Liotta in GoodFellas. Simon is experiencing furious musical differences with the rest of the band and is making money through selling weed and taking part in big pharma medical experiments. Emily Skeggs is excellent as quirky, dreamy Patty, who takes indistinct Polaroids of herself masturbating to his music in her childhood bedroom and sends them to him via the mailbox address on the band’s flyers.But, when Simon gets into trouble after setting something on fire, Patty shields him from the police, never dreaming that he is the object of her self-pleasuring fan correspondence; meanwhile, he has no idea that this irritating dork has been sending him the (rather gratifying) photos. Soon the pair are getting into criminal scrapes together, like a low-rent Bonnie and Clyde who never actually travel anywhere.Simon’s most famous song, evidently, is something called Dinner in America, and this film proceeds in a series of three desperately uncomfortable middle-class family dinners with three different families, Simon being a smouldering guest at each. The “dinner table scene with sulky kids” scene is a staple of US indie movies satirising suburban ennui, and this could have been a cliche. But Rehmeier creates something amusing and offbeat in each one, and Pat Healy and Mary Lynn Rajskub are entertaining as Patty’s uptight parents.Twenty years ago, Sam Mendes’s American Beauty and Todd Solondz’s Happiness were at opposite ends of the spectrum of difficult weirdness for this kind of material, Solondz setting a gold standard for strangeness, dysfunction and discomfort. Rehmeier is at the American Beauty end of things. His film has its own truculent charm. Dinner in America is released on digital platforms on 1 June."
In the Heights review – Lin-Manuel Miranda musical loaded with Sunny-D optimism,There’s no space for bad feelings as Miranda’s exuberant and innocent Broadway hit transfers to the screen,3,"There’s a sentimental kind of exuberance and more than two solid hours of dancing in the streets in this boisterous, if earnest, movie-musical version of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Broadway hit from 2008. (Famously, it was while taking a well-earned holiday after this stage success that Miranda chanced upon Ron Chernow’s biography of Alexander Hamilton – and the rest is showbiz history.)It is a sweet-natured film with Sunny-D optimism and a no-place-like-home ethic; in a pleasant way, it felt like a feature-length version of that moment in Fame when all the kids start dancing and singing around the yellow cab outside New York’s High School of Performing Arts. You might also compare it to West Side Story, soon to be revived by Steven Spielberg. But this is a world of all jets and no sharks, or all sharks and no jets. There is no serious conflict here, and the quarrels, family rows and lovers’ tiffs disappear very quickly.The scene is the Washington Heights district of Manhattan, a vibrant hub of Latin American communities. A hardworking, romantic young guy called Usnavi runs a bodega, a corner store, with his cheeky cousin Sonny (Gregory Diaz) and dreams of one day making it home to the Dominican Republic to open a beachside bar. On stage this was Miranda’s part; now it is played with likable openness by Anthony Ramos, with Miranda taking a cameo as someone selling cold drinks from a cart. Bashful Usnavi is in love with smart, beautiful Vanessa (Melissa Barerra) who works in a nearby nail salon, but with ambitions to be a fashion designer. Meanwhile, Nina (Leslie Grace) returns to the neighbourhood from her studies at Stanford to a hero’s welcome but she’s secretly eaten up with sadness: she wants to drop out, sick of racism in the student body, and worried about her dad Kevin (Jimmy Smits) going broke to pay her tuition. Meanwhile, her ex-boyfriend Benny (Corey Hawkins) has obviously still got a thing for her.The summer heat climbs in parallel with the emotional temperature, and the rumours are that someone has won big with a lottery ticket bought in Usnavi’s store; it all climaxes in a calamitous power cut (inspired by a notorious Washington Heights blackout in 1999) which kills all the fridges and the A/Cs but not the nonstop party atmosphere, and the community is kept grounded by a wise matriarchal figure of “Abuela” (ie “Grandma”) Claudia, played by Olga Merediz. There are loads of enjoyable setpieces, high-energy ensemble scenes and warbling Broadway showtunes with a spoonful of rap: I loved the goofy spectacular at the outdoor swimming pool (in-pool dancing is always entertaining) and Ramos has an open, pleasant, intelligent face. In a way, he’s an actor in search of a more demanding role, and almost everyone here (except Merediz and Smits) looks like players in a very talented youth theatre company.There’s plenty of vibrancy and winning charm but a persistent and weird lack of grownup plausibility. Of course, that’s part of what a musical is, but there is no place for grit in this oyster. Nina, for example, talks about the ugly incident that soured her experience of Stanford: her roommate misplaced an expensive necklace and this young woman’s wealthy parents insisted on literally searching Nina, and when this necklace was simply found in the roommate’s bag, not only did Nina get no apology, but she found herself stammering out an apology herself – an intense humiliation. But this all happens off-camera. In the Heights themselves, bad feelings evaporate in the film’s greenhouse-controlled atmosphere of bubbling excitement. There is certainly no racial tension, unless you count the white removals guy who calls Vanessa’s colleague “ma’am” and is sharply told that this should be “señorita”.It’s impossible to object to In the Heights with its almost childlike innocence. Ramos is very good and it is great to see Stephanie Beatriz (from TV’s Brooklyn Nine-Nine) and Dascha Polanco (from Orange Is the New Black) round out the supporting cast. But this is a pretty quaint image of street life, whose unrealities probably worked better on stage. In the Heights is released on 11 June in the US, 18 June in the UK and 24 June in Australia."
Pink: All I Know So Far review – parenting meets perilous pop stardom,This documentary highlights the singer’s touching dedication to teaching her kids as they accompany her on a world tour but doesn’t dig deep ,2,"The title of this fly-on-the-wall documentary following the pop star Pink and family on her 2018-19 world tour is taken from a recent song in which the Pennsylvanian lung-buster explains her life thus far to her daughter Willow. Traipsing round various European cities, we learn en route that the singer also wrote letters, to be read in the future, to her eldest child on the day she was born and on her first day at kindergarten. Her commitment to her two kids – which goes as far as taking them on tour – is touching, and Pink fans will doubtless be hopping at the prospect of being invited into the domestic circle. But this undemanding work, directed by The Greatest Showman’s Michael Gracey, comes across a bit like another family memento for their own mantelpiece.“Re-sil-ience,” is how Pink chops up a difficult word for her two-year-old, Jameson. Dealing in similarly manageable chunks with the biathlon of parenting and high-end stadium performance that is her life must be the only way of getting through it. The singer is admirably hands-on with both her children (with husband Carey Hart on daddy day care), as well as working out the details of a painstakingly choreographed stage show that at points is close to musical theatre. One interesting point is the physical strain on her: the film points out that the former gymnast often simultaneously sings and performs acrobatics, two activities that pull in different directions. Her wire stunts on show at Wembley stadium, dozens of feet above the arena floor, are truly hair-raising. (Perhaps that explains the coiffure.)But there is little narrative, beyond the Wembley gig approaching; and, more crucially, little conflict, outer or inner. Gracey lets Pink run with too much bland affirmational musing, ranging from the diverse family that is her crew, to the self-actualising lifestyle in which she is raising her children. This all serves to bolster her Streisandesque diva status, but it comes across as a bit self-congratulatory. The fanbase will cheer the fact she has outgrown the self-questioning and fractured home life – cursorily detailed here – from which she made her early career. But that happiness – notoriously difficult to make drama out of – is perhaps left to her songs. Pink: All I Know So Far is released on Amazon Prime Video on 21 May."
PG: Psycho Goreman review – controlling a demon alien is child’s play,"A cheeky 12-year-old develops extraordinary powers after taking control of a menacing extraterrestrial, in this engaging comedy-horror ",3,"Siblings Mimi (Nita-Josee Hanna, outrageously talented), a ferocious force of nature, and her timid older brother Luke (Owen Myre, also terrific) find a strange, glowing gem while messing around in the dirt. Turns out it summons a blue-hued, bad-tempered alien (actor Matthew Ninaber under a ton of makeup and prosthetics) from the planet Gygax; considered a “demon” by his enemies, he describes himself as “the archduke of nightmares”. However, once Mimi works out they can control him with the gem, she renames him Psycho Goreman, or PG for short.Delighted with this new source of power, Mimi goes on to prove there is truly no force in the universe more capricious, cruel and catty than a 12-year-old who can have anything they want. Soon, she is forcing PG to turn her brother’s friend Alasdair (Scout Flint) into a squat monster that looks like a giant brain with craft-shop googly eyes, as well as compelling everyone to play a ridiculously otiose sport she made up, the rules of which take hours to explain.Writer-director Steven Kostanski is a wee bit over-reliant on bathos to generate humour; just about every laugh is generated by PG declaiming something menacing or committing an act of violence and then being treated like a naughty puppy by Mimi. Nevertheless, the gag is worked over from enough different angles to keep it funny, and it helps that Hanna, Ninaber and the rest of the cast have acute comic timing and know how to sell the material.Meanwhile, the makeup effects for PG, Alasdair and a whole menagerie of alien monsters are unnervingly moist and menacing. It’s no surprise to learn Kostanski has worked as a special makeup artist on bigger budget projects such as Suicide Squad and It, but this proves he has a way with actors as much as a knack for latex and fake blood. PG: Psycho Goreman is available on Shudder from 20 May."
Rare Beasts review – masterful Billie Piper rips up the romcom rulebook,"In her directorial debut, Piper announces herself as a truly thrilling film-maker with this bleakly brilliant inversion of the cutesy London love story",4,"Romcoms are about love and they want to be loved. Billie Piper’s anti-romcom is about something else – and it wants something else.Rare Beasts is a bold experiment in nerve-jangling confrontation: it has the structure and ingredients of romantic comedy but turns everything on its head. On paper, it could be made by Richard Curtis: there are attractive views of London, an awful date in a restaurant, bittersweet scenes with parents, reflective moments by the river, a Bridget Jones-y media job, a glamorous wedding scene and even a cameo for Lily James. But everything goes wrong. Billie Piper’s movie refuses to read the room; it ignores the traditional cues for comedy and gentleness and the learning of life lessons. It is on a spectrum of its own.The movie screeches when it should soothe; where the heroine should find love, she finds absence; where she should show feminist solidarity, she confesses she still needs a man; where there should be closure, there is nothing. The last time I saw something as bleak as this was at the Samuel Beckett festival in Enniskillen. It isn’t an easy watch but the fierce, focused intelligence of Piper’s film-making is exhilarating.She plays Mandy, who works for a TV production company, sitting around with other blank-faced media professionals pitching terrible ideas. She is a single mum, with a difficult child who may have OCD: this is Larch, played by Toby Woolf. She lives with her own mother, the jaded and cantankerous Marion (Kerry Fox) separated from Mandy’s dad, who is annoyingly still on the scene, unwilling or unable to provide financial support despite preparing for a holiday in Thailand. This is the roguish Vic, played by David Thewlis.Mandy’s troubles start when she goes on a date with an entirely obnoxious man called Pete, uningratiatingly played by Leo Bill. Pete is everything she doesn’t need. He is religious, in a peculiarly pompous and defensive way, he is conceited and self-pitying, he has an unlovely habit of telling Mandy what women want and what they should want.In theory, Pete should be on the screen for a few seconds, one of the awful guys on awful dates that the heroine has to endure before she meets The One. But poor, lonely Mandy has no other takers; her low self-esteem means that Pete’s boorish and misogynistic barbs find their target. And maybe dating Pete would be the mature thing to do. Maybe he’s got a point about women and men. Maybe the situation can be forced into something acceptable by sheer force of will. Maybe it’s absurd to wait for some imaginary ideal man. Maybe Mandy should settle.In a way, Rare Beasts is a 90-minute nightmare-fantasy showing what might happen if you made the wrong choice and got into a relationship with the wrong guy in the montage. In real life that is exactly what people do, while maintaining the fiction of romantic destiny until the end of their days. How has Mandy got into this self-hating situation? She thinks she’s been messed up by her dad, who is casually unrepentant throughout.If Piper is processing something personal in this film, she is doing so with uncompromising inventiveness and force. I also suspect that, like so many people, she is a fan of Paul Thomas Anderson’s much admired satirical romance Punch-Drunk Love, from 2002. But she is doing something very distinctive here, too.Go into Rare Beasts expecting a funny romantic film and you will have a rough time. Go for a challenging, psychological satire and … well, you’ll still have a rough time. But you’ll see a smart piece of work from a very smart new film-maker. Rare Beasts is released in cinemas and on digital platforms on 21 May."
Matthew Barney: Redoubt; Igshaan Adams: Kicking Dust – review,"Hayward Gallery, London Ovid meets the NRA as Matthew Barney revisits his Idaho childhood, while Igshaan Adams takes tapestry to the next level",0,"Matthew Barney’s first British show in more than 10 years is all picturesque nature, a 21st-century version of the American sublime. Everything centres on the Sawtooth Mountains of Idaho, where the artist was raised. Gilded tree trunks soar up through darkened galleries, radiant etchings cast an eerie glow on the ground, and a feature-length movie unleashes spectacular visions of snowbound peaks, torrential rivers, star-shine, dawn, dusk and wolves. This is a meditation on the wilderness, with Barney as a multimedia Thoreau.The film is easily summarised (surprisingly, given the abstruse mythologies of Barney’s great five-film Cremaster cycle). Ovid’s tale of Diana and Actaeon is restaged with Actaeon working as a ranger for the US forest service, and Diana as a camouflaged sharpshooter tracking him through the sights of a hi-tech rifle. The nymphs he unwittingly spies are two contemporary dancers in hideous white long johns. The choreography is laboriously weird.But Actaeon is not just wandering among wolves and dancers. He is also an artist – what else? – engraving the peaks and pines on portable plates in sub-zero temperatures. He has an associate called the Electroplater, who performs alchemy upon these engravings in her off-grid caravan, but also creates her own astrolabe sculptures. Which, in turn, have obvious counterparts in the complex hoop dances of a Native American performer in the local one-horse town.There is no dialogue, no characterisation or evolving drama. Though there are sporadic jolts, including the revelation – when he removes his hat – that grizzled old Actaeon, with his white beard and grandpa specs, is in fact Barney himself. (He was only 52, and still glamorously athletic, when the film was shot in 2019.) Diana is played by Anette Wachter, an NRA champion. The wolves are descendants of the original animals controversially reintroduced into Idaho a generation ago. (Should they still be regarded as an endangered species?) The film is at least in part concerned with the politicisation of America’s great outdoors.But it is essentially a form of landscape art, reverential in its observation of icicles, silver moons and solitary firs, like flagpoles on the Sawtooth summits, of wild creatures (both animal and human) slipping among the trees like figures in a winter Brueghel. But you will have to hold fast to these moments of intensity, for the pace is intolerably glacial at two hours and more. Admission includes a link to watch Redoubt at home, should you prefer. If you have that kind of time, try true snowbound masterpieces such as The Great Silence, The Shining, McCabe and Mrs Miller or even The Revenant instead.Diana, with the bathos that undermines this film, does not shoot the artist but one of his works. You can see this very object at the Hayward Gallery, red copper (with bullet hole) in an open golden box. These framed plates are a most original hybrid of image, engraving and sculpture, emitting a kind of moonlit glow and bodying forth in three dimensions. They freeze-frame the film’s forests, peaks and constellations in miniature, transforming them into something almost numinous with the use of chemicals and electroplating.Gigantic sculptures, alongside, tilt upwards like rocket launchers: tree trunks that resemble both telescopes and military equipment, torn roots flaring like jet flames. Molten brass and copper, poured through the charred remains of Sawtooth trees, turn these great columns into gleaming reliquaries. Man, machine and metal, and their coexistence with nature, have always been among Barney’s most devastating themes.But it is through the intimate scale of the engravings that he really transports you into the wilds. Liquid crystals forming across the engraving plates metamorphose into cloud rack, snow light and Milky Way, the dark forests of the night. And in the final work, thickly encrusted, you even catch sight of yourself reflected in the shining surface, a miniature figure passing quickly through the Idaho landscape.The accompanying Hayward show, by the South African artist Igshaan Adams (born 1982), is outstandingly original too. Adams weaves vast tapestries that miraculously incorporate beads, glitter, shells and even painted stones into their immaculate warp and weft. These hangings resemble aerial views, yet also journeys through a mystical landscape of bright rivers and secret paths, dense undergrowths, urban grids and shadowy flatlands. More humble flotsam is swept up into whorls of silver wire that rise like tornadoes, drift like clouds or roll like tumbleweed on the gallery floor.Here and there are hints of prayer mats, Lurex clothing, crochet, grass and human hair. Everything speaks of something personal, possibly political, yet of some mysterious place elsewhere. A woven dreamscape of an installation through which the viewer moves as if in another world: this is the most radically imaginative use of tapestry I have ever come across.Star ratings (out of five)Matthew Barney: Redoubt ★★★★Igshaan Adams: Kicking Dust ★★★★★Matthew Barney: Redoubt and Igshaan Adams: Kicking Dust are at the Hayward Gallery, London, from 19 May to 25 July"
Undergods review – nightmare visions of a familiar world,"Chino Moya’s stylish debut, an anthology of unsettling dystopian tales, lacks subtlety but brims with exceptional performances",3,"The Spanish film-maker Chino Moya, who directed the colourfully Orwellian music video for St Vincent’s Digital Witness, makes his feature debut with this eye-catching, Twilight Zone-style anthology of future-tense tales. Laced with a graveside humour reminiscent of the old EC comics (Moya’s multidisciplinary credits include the graphic novel Flat Filters), it’s a collection of grimly satirical snapshots, fitting together like the misshapen pieces of a Chinese puzzle ball to create a dyspeptic, dystopian portrait of our past, present and future.In a bleak European underworld, a pair of corpse collectors, K (Johann Myers) and Z (Géza Röhrig), prowl the streets, picking up the dead. Around them are the remnants of a once-grand civilisation, the aftermath of some apocalyptic collapse. As they work, they spin nightmarish tales of other worlds, leading us into a fluid maze of cautionary tales.In the first, with clear echoes of JG Ballard’s High-Rise, fractured couple Ron (Michael Gould) and Ruth (Hayley Carmichael) are the first tenants in a faceless new apartment building (“a housing revolution”), unsettled by a neighbour who arrives at their door, claiming to have locked himself out of his 11th-storey flat. In the second, which unfolds as a bedtime story tinged by ETA Hoffmann’s The Sandman, greedy, mistrustful merchant Hans (Eric Godon) double-crosses an eccentric foreigner (Jan Bijvoet), only to find that his daughter, Maria (Tanya Reynolds), has been abducted. In the third and most striking episode, the lives of middle-rung company drone Dominic (Adrian Rawlins) and his malcontent wife, Rachel (Kate Dickie), are turned on their heads when Rachel’s former partner Sam (Sam Louwyck) reappears after 15 years – with catastrophic consequences.Raised in Madrid and now resident in London, Moya describes his feature debut (which is co-produced by Blade Runner director Ridley Scott’s company) as inhabiting a “limbo where stories and characters move between 20th-century failed utopian empires and 21st-century, low-cost, Ikea nightmares”. Throughout, we watch bourgeois family units descending into some kind of feral hell, their disparate stories tumbling into each other in disorienting fashion. Crucially, each of these descents is triggered by a crisis within – or breakdown of – a central white male character (no wonder a drunken rendition of My Way looms large), suggesting that what we are witnessing is not merely the unravelling of “civilisation”, but of the patriarchy that created it.The subtext may not be subtle, but what Moya’s film lacks in nuance it makes up for in terms of ambition. These are tales of little men played out upon an epic canvas, thanks to designers Marketa Korinková and Elo Soode and cinematographer David Raedeker. What gives Undergods bite, however, is the strength of the performances. As our ghoulish guides, Röhrig and Myers inject an element of jet-black Shakespearean comedy. Having recently excelled as the fearsome Paudi in Calm With Horses, Ned Dennehy casts another impressively threatening shadow as smiling interloper Harry (“I’m here to help”), while Burn Gorman brings lashings of corporate slime to the final tale.But it’s the magnificent Dickie who steals the show, with a performance that modulates brilliantly between humour, pathos and horror, keeping the audience on their toes. One moment she’s a pill-popping carer, nurturing her child; the next, she’s a DIY new-age guru, tending to her lost love; then she discovers her “inner voice” with a fixed smile that eerily recalls Jennifer Ehle’s demonic leer in the final act of Saint Maud.Pulsing, 1980s-inflected synth sounds mingle with a paranoid sound design, capturing the future-retro vibes of a Kafkaesque world that seems, at times, uncomfortably close to home.Undergods is in cinemas and on digital platforms from 17 May"
Servants review – stylish iron curtain noir,Trainee priests rebel against the communist infiltration of their seminary in this thriller set in 1980s Czechoslovakia,4,"A car parks beneath an underpass; a body is dumped in the middle of the road. The opening scene of director Ivan Ostrochovský’s stylish political thriller, co-written with Rebecca Lenkiewicz and Marek Lescák, plays like a film noir, with its high-contrast monochrome cinematography and empty, rain-slicked streets. The Czech film-maker’s second feature is set in 1980, three decades into then-Czechoslovakia’s communist rule. Teenage students Juraj (Samuel Skyva) and Michal (Samuel Polakovic) swap their sweater vests for cassocks at a seminary, not yet realising that it has been infiltrated by the regime. The dean (Vladimír Strnisko) and his students are watched closely by Doctor Ivan (a menacing Vlad Ivanov), even though the dean is a member of Pacem in Terris, the real-life association of priests who collaborated with the state.Some of the young men quietly rebel, producing pamphlets and contacting the Vatican in secret. The chilling image of a heap of confiscated typewriters – 64 of them – piled in the back of a truck is a potent assertion that personal ethics and independent thought pose a genuine threat to authoritarian rule. Ostrochovský’s camera emphasises the constricting architecture of both church and state, with its black and white morality and a claustrophobic central courtyard, frequently portrayed via stiff, judgmental God’s-eye shots.

Maya the Bee 3: The Golden Orb review – pants ants antics,The third instalment in the animated insect franchise for kids is a buzz-free disappointment,2,"As cinemas reopen in England, normal service resumes in the world of little kids’ films. First up for the under-fives is Maya the Bee 3, the latest instalment of the sappy, sentimental franchise from Australia.In the new movie plucky little bee Maya (voiced by Coco Jack Gillies) and her best friend Willi (Benson Jack Anthony) get lumbered with transporting a golden egg to the ant colony at Bonsai Peak. Of course, the egg cracks en route, leaving the pair holding the ant baby – an adorable squidge they nickname Schmoosh. Cue some ant nappy-changing and lessons about responsibility. Weirdly, there is next to nothing specific about bees; with a little tweak here and there in the script, you could substitute bees for chipmunks or dinosaurs.The baby ant, it turns out, is a princess who is destined to become ruler of the colony. But a knucklehead, turbo-charged beetle with a six pack called Bumbulus (Christian Charisiou) tries to kidnap her so that he can run the ants off the mountain. Like the Incredible Hulk of the insect world, he bounces through the undergrowth with his goons.The film is bright and sunny, and the sense of life at ground level is nicely done in places. Everyone in this world is food for another creature; even the beetles cower when a cute little birdie swoops in looking for breakfast. Still, it’s cheap-looking and dismally low on fun. The novelty of being in an actual cinema should sell it to the tinies. Parents will probably find themselves reaching for their phones. Maya the Bee: The Golden Orb is released in cinemas on 17 May."
A Space in Time review – lyrical portrait of a family facing an incurable disorder,This poignant documentary about two young brothers with Duchenne muscular dystrophy celebrates the power of love and togetherness,3,"Here is a deeply personal documentary that raises awareness about a disability without neglecting the interiority of those living with the condition. Co-directed by Riccardo Servini and Nick Taussig, the film follows the Taussig family’s experience of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a genetic disorder that affects their young sons, Theo and Oscar.Duchenne is incurable and fatal. By the time Theo and Oscar are in their teens, they will be using wheelchairs full time; their 20s will come with ventilators. Throughout the film, Taussig gently explains these realities to his sons, with no sugarcoating. Satisfying children’s curiosity has never been easy, and here the task is made even more difficult when science itself has yet to provide all answers.The recurring juxtaposition of these conversations with Theo and Oscar playing in the garden or getting dressed for school captures how the condition, while debilitating, is also just one facet of their lives. At one point, the inquisitive Theo asks if ice cream can cure Duchenne. The boys’ experiences are rendered acutely intimate, normalised and without hollow pity.The film also places a poignant emphasis on community and accessibility. Thanks to the goodwill of a building company, the Taussigs’ house is designed to meet the needs of their sons, including wide hallways to provide easy access for their wheelchairs. Interviews with people at different stages of Duchenne and their families illuminate how the condition progresses and also highlight the solidarity among them.Moments of darkness recur throughout the film, the final shot of the Taussigs sitting and laughing on a swing says it all. The future will always be shifting and uncertain, but they, and their community, are all in this together. A Space in Time is released on 17 May on digital platforms."
Objector review – Israeli anti-occupation documentary wears its politics on its sleeve,Molly Stuart’s film about a woman imprisoned for refusing to do military service paints a fascinating portrait of a country riven by conflict,3,"In this rousing, unabashedly left-inflected documentary, we meet Atalya Ben Abba, a young Israeli woman staring down the barrel of the mandatory military service everyone in the country must do when they come of age. But Atalya doesn’t want to play any part in the state apparatus that makes the occupation of Palestine possible. Instead, she proclaims herself a conscientious objector, and must face time in prison. While her brother Amitai gets where she’s coming from, others in her family – her mother Alona, sister, father, grandparents – find it harder to understand Atalya’s point of view, especially the members of the older generation who grew up in the shadow of the Holocaust.On the other hand, footage here proves that Zionist extremism permeates every generation: frothy-mouthed young Israeli rightwingers show up at the demonstrations where Atalya speaks only to counterprotest and demand that Atalya and other objectors “go back to Berlin”. Still, Atalya’s story and the testimony of some of her fellow objectors who hope for a political and diplomatic solution to the conflict suggests that the younger generation’s attitudes may be shifting, even if Atalya’s nephew learns about joining the army as early at the first grade.Director Molly Stuart includes interview footage with displaced Palestinians as well as pro-settlement Israelis in order to strike some semblance of balance. But the surging score over montages of Atalya protesting, and others demonstrating their support for her while she’s in military prison makes it pretty clear where our sympathies ought to lie. Strategies like that are legitimate for the purposes of persuasive film-making, but I intensely distrust the use of staged re-enactments in documentaries, like the one in which Atalya argues her case before the Israel Defense Forces’ conscience committee hearing. Even if it’s supposed to be based on a transcript, it just feels disingenuous. Objector is released on 14 May on True Story."
"Cowboys review – progressive, predictable Montana trans tale",Steve Zahn plays against type in this well-meaning but clunking drama about a couple who clash over their trans child,2,"Comic actors Steve Zahn and Jillian Bell are uncharacteristically earnest in this achingly well-intentioned but thuddingly heavy-handed family drama. Zahn plays Troy, the heavily medicated but supportive father of a trans boy, Joe (Sasha Knight, impressive). Bell is Sally, Joe’s mother, who forces Barbies and pink on to her mortified child. In the war zone of Troy and Sally’s relationship, pronouns are wielded like weapons.Even before the repeated shots of Troy chucking back mood stabilisers by the fistful, the unsanctioned father-son road trip into the Montana wilderness seems like a really bad idea. Then Troy loses his tablets and the cops, led by a firm but fair Ann Dowd, close in on the boy and his increasingly erratic father. Plenty of child-with-gun foreshadowing leaves little doubt about how the third act will play out.On Curzon Home Cinema and digital download"
Once Upon a River review – a meandering story of survival,The teenage lead’s performance is the highlight of this film about a Native American girl’s search for her estranged mother,3,"A survival story in which a teenage girl, severed by tragedy from her home, goes in search of her estranged mother, Haroula Rose’s debut feature Once Upon a River has a superficial kinship with Debra Granik’s Winter’s Bone. But rather than the sinewy toughness of that picture, this adaptation of the novel by Bonnie Jo Campbell is meandering in its pacing, losing power rather than building it as the story unfolds. Apart from the atmospheric wetland backdrop, the film’s main asset is Kenadi DelaCerna, self-possessed and soulful in the role of the part Native American 15-year-old, Margo Crane.In virtual cinemas and on demand"
End of Sentence review – a masterclass in understated acting,"John Hawkes is at his beguiling best as a man on a road trip with his estranged son in Elfar Adalstein’s flawed, fascinating debut",3,"John Hawkes is one of those actors with a lived-in quality that pulls viewers in before a single line of dialogue is even spoken, and End of a Sentence is yet another testament to the stunning ease with which he slips into his roles. A healing road trip that takes the audience from Alabama to the winding roads of Ireland, Elfar Adalsteins’ directorial debut captures well-trodden paths with fresh eyes.Frank (Hawkes) is a mild-mannered man with a severe exactness to his gestures, the polar opposite of his volatile and impulsive son Sean (Logan Lerman), who has just got out of prison after doing time for car theft. As Frank’s wife has died, the estranged pair are forced to squeeze into a plane, and then a car, as they fulfil her dying wish to have her ashes scattered at a lake in Ireland. Along the way, they pick up Jewel (Sarah Bolger), a hitchhiker with a troubled past, all while attempting to exorcise their shared demons.End of a Sentence is a reminder of how pleasurable it is to see genuinely pitch-perfect acting, the kind that quietly brings characters’ inner lives to the fore. The father-son relationship feels beautifully real, due in part to the precise, economical writing but also to the effortless chemistry between Hawkes and Lerman.Despite her brief screen time, Bolger is arresting and memorable, no easy feat considering that her character feels like a plot device. This writing, along with the occasional on-the-nose song choice and heavy-handed colour correction, lets down a film that is at its best when the camera takes a step back and simply allows the action to unfold.End of Sentence is released on 10 May on digital platforms."
"Charlatan review – a fascinating, frustrating tale of bottled-up emotion",Agnieszka Holland once again proves she is the real deal with this austere biopic of a faith healer in 1930s Czechoslovakia,3,"Only last year at Berlin, Agnieszka Holland presented Mr Jones: a big, brashly ambitious movie inspired by the life of Welsh journalist Gareth Jones, who proclaimed the truth about Stalin’s terror-famine in the Ukraine in the 1930s, when the liberal west had been content to overlook it.Mr Jones has just been released in the UK and Holland’s work-rate is clearly prodigious, because she returns with another big period picture from Europe’s painful heart, torn apart by totalitarian ideology, this one scripted by Czech screenwriter Marek Epstein. It is intriguing, if a little frustrating: the lightly fictionalised story of Jan Mikolášek, the Czech herbalist and faith healer who became a cult figure in the 1930s. He treated rich and poor alike, accepting powerful Germans as his patients during the Nazi occupation and then communist officials after the war.His most famous client was the Czechoslovak president Antonín Zápotocký, but after the latter’s death in 1957, Mikolášek was put on trial by the communist government who had long feared and resented what they saw as a charlatanism, existing outside state medicine and owing nothing to communist ideology. Or was it that his charlatanism was more popular and successful than theirs? As Mikolášek is questioned in his cell about career, his life unfolds in flashback. He is played with fiercely controlled stoicism by the veteran Czech actor Ivan Trojan, whose son Josef plays the young Mikolášek.Was Mikolášek a “charlatan”? Rightly or wrongly, the movie is vehement that he was not. The drama in no way resides in any lingering ambiguity. This Mikolášek is a man of principle and intuitive genius who presides over a flourishing practice. People (mainly poor people: the movie doesn’t show him in the less saintly context of treating the rich and powerful, except at gunpoint) queue for hours outside his mansion with their urine samples in clear bottles. Merely by gazing into this fluid, Mikolášek can apparently come up with miraculously detailed and effective diagnoses, and sometimes gives Vitamin D-deficient patients money out of his own pocket so they can go to the seaside for some restorative sunshine, curtly shrugging off their sobbing thanks.Holland and Epstein give Mikolášek some vulnerability and complexity by imagining for him a secret gay life with his assistant Frantisek Palko (Juraj Loj), a fictional gesture based on longstanding conjecture that grew from the failure of Mikolášek’s marriage and the fact that his assistant lived with him.This is a forceful, capable movie with an interesting story to tell but its potency consists in a handful of gripping episodes, the most startling being when the young Mikolášek has developed a love of herbs and a vocation for healing, and is in anguish about the fact that his sister is being threatened with having her gangrenous leg amputated. The night before the hideous operation, he sneaks into her room without permission and smears a herbal concoction of his own over the blackened flesh. A director such as Spielberg would have wrung every last drop out of that scene but Holland is more austere. There are many other “miracle” scenes, which are watchable and satisfying, and the movie posits an intense, guilt-wracked Catholicism for Mikolášek, who lives with anguish due to his sexuality.The dark side of Mikolášek is less satisfyingly evoked. As a kid, he is told to drown a sackful of kittens because this would be the kindest way to do it – but instead he bashes the sack against a rock. Because of frustration? A streak of violence? It’s not entirely clear. In adult life, he is controlling and jealous about his assistant, resenting the man’s wife, and uses his skills in an unforgivable way. But much later, there is a Judas-type betrayal, which appears to hint at some weakness and culpability on Mikolášek’s part, and this does not quite gel with the how we had been encouraged to view him. Charlatan is a film that does not quite satisfy the curiosity it arouses. Charlatan is released on 7 May on digital platforms."
Betrayed review – restrained depiction of Norway’s Holocaust victims,"This account of the internment of a Jewish boxer from Oslo packs an emotional punch, but pulls back from displaying any real horrors",3,"Steven Spielberg once said of Schindler’s List that he was telling a story of the Holocaust, not the story. “There are millions of stories of the Shoah. Six million of them we’ll never hear.” In this heartfelt, restrained movie, Norwegian film-maker Eirik Svensson dramatises the true story of one family of victims from Nazi-occupied Norway. In November 1942, large numbers of Norwegian Jews were rounded up in the middle of the night and taken to a dock in Oslo; 529 were loaded on to a German cargo ship, the SS Donau, and deported to Auschwitz.Jakob Oftebro plays Charles Braude, a good-natured and thoroughly decent young boxing champion who lives in Oslo with his parents and grown-up siblings, all six of them crammed into a two-bedroom apartment. The film begins at the very start of the war, taking great care to paint the Braudes as a close-knit, happy family; it is a little idealised perhaps, but knowing what is to come, incredibly emotional.The Braudes don’t believe the war can touch them in neutral Norway. Then the Germans invade; Charles is arrested and sent to an internment camp with his father and brothers. A Norwegian soldier in the camp, a man with a toad-like smile who makes a big show of being one of the good guys, challenges him to a boxing match, putting Charles in a terrible dilemma – it’s impossible to say no, but to survive he cannot draw attention to himself. The title is an accusation against Norwegians who collaborated with the Nazis; and Betrayed is also at pains to show how some ordinary Norwegians were indifferent to the fate of their Jewish neighbours.It’s a film of desperately upsetting details. Near the end, after the Donau has set sail, large bins full of ID cards stamped with a red “J” are left behind at the dock – no longer needed. And yet there is nothing here that’s too disturbing, no humiliation that’s unwatchably harrowing. It left me wondering what room there is for understatement in a film about the Holocaust, or whether at some point restraint diminishes the true horror. Betrayed is released on 10 May on digital platforms."
Star Wars: the Bad Batch review – badass clones strike back,"Following on from the long-running animation Star Wars: The Clone Wars, this new Disney+ series boasts mutant renegades and action-packed fight scenes. May the fourth be with you!",3,"Happy Star Wars Day! What started out as a throwaway joke several decades ago – of saying “May the fourth be with you” on 4 May – has snowballed in the past few years and is now a fixture on the calendar, in the Disney marketing department at least. With no new Star Wars movie on the horizon – a root and branch inquiry into what went wrong with 2019’s The Rise of Skywalker is hopefully ongoing – Disney+ instead marks Star Wars Day 2021 with the fanboy substitute that is a new cartoon series.Star Wars: the Bad Batch (Disney+) follows on from the long-running animated adventure Star Wars: The Clone Wars, giving a group of characters who were prominent in the final season their own show, and is set in the period between the films Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope. For members of the general public considering whether to watch a sequel to a cartoon spin-off from a movie franchise, the questions are: can I watch it without being fully across all the relevant galactic folklore, and is it worth it anyway? Yes, you can, and yes, it is – barely. Not knowing who, say, Saw Gerrera or Caleb Dume are, and thus not yelping with recognition when they appear, is not a problem. Getting used to the pretensions and dramatic stiffness of these animations, which never seem quite sure how old the ideal viewer is, might be more of a barrier.The basics: the conflict depicted in The Clone Wars has come to an end, and the Galactic Empire that Luke Skywalker and friends will one day fight against is taking ominous shape. This burgeoning autocracy is using cloned humans to eliminate the pesky Jedi and their annoying moral code, branding them traitors who must be executed under a diktat called Order 66. But it hasn’t reckoned with a crack, maverick, elite, rogue and really quite notably badass gang of mutant clones who, due to their minor genetic defects, have a particular set of skills and a tendency to deviate from the exact parameters of any mission they are given.In an outrageous bit of narrative over-emphasis, these renegades with a penchant for turning Order 66 upside down are known as Clone Force 99. They are Expendable X-Men, an interstellar A-Team, and they are about to get into a series of scrapes on our behalf. The 70-minute pilot trudges through setting up their unsubtly disparate characters: the square-jawed but flawed leader, the super-strong but childish one, the nerdy genius, and the pale, narrow-eyed one who complains icily when the others won’t let him kill innocent bystanders.You can forgive some slightly broad voice acting once you know that the whole group is played by one actor, Dee Bradley Baker. Harder to cope with is the dialogue, which – not unusually for cartoons like this – keeps making cringeworthy stabs at maturity, like a teenager in a bow tie. It is forever lapsing into a sort of trainee sarcasm, a zone where, “You can say that again!”, “First time for everything!” and “Well, I’m convinced!” are deemed the sort of burning put-downs that pass muster within a top-level mercenary crew.But we are here for the action, not the nuances of the script, and the opening episode has a couple of corking set pieces. Take, for example, the scene where the Bad Batch have to prove themselves to grey-hearted imperial assistant manager Admiral Tarkin – later in his nefarious career, when he has become Darth Vader’s boss, he is played by Peter Cushing in the original Star Wars movie and, pleasingly, heis drawn here to resemble him – by engaging in a fire fight with killer robots. An exciting extended shootout, and an escape from a jail cell that looks impregnable but is monitored by dopey guards, is the sort of impossible defiance of peril that made The Mandalorian such a blast. There is one proper belly laugh, too, when a dispute in a spaceship canteen with a horde of regular, identikit clones suddenly and messily escalates.By the end of the first chapter, some necessary personnel changes have been made and the Batch are warping tall, established as rebels who have cocked an irreversible snook at the evil empire. They are probably not enough to make you feel the “fourth” and celebrate Star Wars Day if you weren’t planning to, but they just about earn their space. This article was amended on 6 May 2021. An earlier version mistakenly said the “May the fourth be with you” joke began on Twitter."
Sheep Without a Shepherd review – perky Chinese thriller that toes the line too carefully,A father uses his obsession with the movies to help his daughter when she is unjustly suspected of murder,2,"It turns out that cinephilia is a productive use of time after all. When his computer is searched, Li Weijie, protagonist of this perky Chinese thriller, has watched 838 films in a year – and he uses his superior knowledge of the seventh art to get his family out of a pickle. Chinese but living in northern Thailand, he scrapes by as an internet technician, but his daughter finds herself at the centre of a murder investigation after she accidentally kills the son of a police chief who was trying to blackmail her with smartphone-filmed rape footage.A remake of the 2013 Malayalam film Drishyam, this big Chinese hit ultimately doffs the cap to Korean cinema: it is Jeong Keun-seob’s 2013 film Montage that inspires Li when he has to provide his family with an alibi.The cat-and-mouse game that ensues is fairly engaging, rooted in two sturdy performances from the main combatants: Xiao Yang’s Li, with his outwardly dopey demeanour but operating with an intelligent pragmatism, and police chief Laoorn, a crack investigator played by Joan Chen with a turbulent confluence of steeliness and maternal anguish. The fine details of Li’s scheme are rather broadly relayed – something not helped by director Sam Quah’s over-eager rhythms. The film cites Hitchcock as the master of tension, and puts commendable effort in to devise similar set pieces. But often the results are a touch forced, as in one scene sparked by a goat noticing Li before the car he is attempting to dispose of sinks into a river.But Sheep Without a Shepherd gets the basics right and, as the town rises in anger in support of the family, it is swept along on a tide of indignation about police corruption and brutality. Given how pertinent a subject this is, it’s a shame about the film’s odd ending, with moralising overtones that make nonsense of Li’s reasons for earlier evading justice. It smacks of Production Code-type censorship and China Film Group, whose production this is, toeing the line on law and order.· Sheep Without a Shepherd is released on 26 April on digital platforms."
The Artist’s Wife review – incomplete portrait of a dysfunctional marriage,"The story of Claire, played by Lena Olin, thwarted in her own artistic ambitions, could have been a force for feminism, but the camera’s gaze is instead fixated on how gorgeous she is",3,"“I create the art. She creates the rest of life. Everything we do is up to Claire.” That’s painter Richard Smythson speaking, an artworld big gun, Jackson Pollock-meets-Philip Roth, played by Bruce Dern. He’s being interviewed in front of camera alongside his long-suffering wife Claire (Lena Olin). Her response is frozen on screen for a split second: a forced smile and behind it a flash of panicked terror and possibly rage. It’s a moment of clarity that triggers a late-marriage crisis in Tom Dolby’s tasteful drama, brilliantly acted but never entirely credible and not quite the force for feminism it wants to be.Pretty soon it’s clear what a pile of crock Richard’s comment is. He is a rampant narcissist, and Claire’s entire married life has been in service to his male genius. Years ago they moved from New York to the Hamptons, where she is isolated but he can paint without distraction. When he wakes up in the morning Claire has a coffee waiting for him; she buys his paintbrushes, cooks his dinners and soothes his ego. Dern plays Richard without a shred of vanity, cantankerous and shrivelled, his behaviour becoming more erratic with early dementia.Claire was an artist when she met him and starts to paint again in secret­. Her regret crystallises at the opening of a show by an old friend, multimedia artist Ada Risi (Stefanie Powers, slightly overdoing bohemian), a woman who has always lived life on her own terms. Olin portrays Claire’s disappointment compellingly, with intelligence and gentle depth. Which is why it’s maddening that the camera’s gaze seems completely fixated on how phenomenally gorgeous she is. It reminded me of Amy Schumer’s Last Fuckable Day sketch; the point seems to be: “Look, she’s hot! At 66!” Would that happen to a male actor? The Artist’s Wife is released on 30 April on digital platforms."
Here Are the Young Men review – Anya Taylor-Joy and the bad boys,Three Dublin lads and their super-smart classmate face an uncertain future in a tale that only hints at dark possibilities,2,"Here is an ensemble coming-of-ager in which someone actually says the line: “That summer may have changed everything …” It’s in a style I associate with the 90s: movies such as Trainspotting or Human Traffic, with people clubbing and yearning and discovering the value of friendship together as the sun comes up. There’s certainly an impressive cast lineup for this one, but there’s also something weirdly formless and frustrating about it as well; the film gestures at some dark and disturbing possibilities in human nature without quite knowing if or how to follow through.Matthew (Dean-Charles Chapman), Kearney (Finn Cole) and Rez (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) are three Dublin lads who leave school without much idea of what they want to do – not like their super-smart classmate Jen (Anya Taylor-Joy) who has some ambitious life plans figured out and on whom sweet, sensitive Matthew has a massive crush. But then the boys witness something horrible that shakes them up and reveals a sinister side to Kearney, who has a creepy attitude to Jen and a droog-like enthusiasm for torturing homeless people.Kearney is also very excited about his plans to spend some of the summer with his brother in glamorous America, and goes on to tell everyone back home about the limitless sex and drugs. The film periodically gives us highly stylised fantasy sequences showing a nightmarish American TV show, presided over by a gruesome Jerry Springer/Jeremy Kyle hybrid. It’s pretty redundant and obvious satire, and if Kearney really is supposed to be in America, and not just pathetically making it up, then his experiences out there have to be written off as a bit of an off-camera mystery. And Kearney is the unconvincing pretext for the film’s attempt to resolve the proceedings on a sombre, but sentimental note. Some strong performances from Cole, Chapman and Taylor-Joy nonetheless. Here Are the Young Men is released on 30 April on digital platforms."
Tom Clancy’s Without Remorse review – macho adventure plays by the book,Michael B Jordan stars as a Navy Seal out for revenge in this formulaic update of Clancy’s 1993 bestseller,2,"In the last few years, screenwriter Taylor Sheridan brought something steely and smart to the action genre with the drug-cartel thriller Sicario and its politically provocative sequel Sicario 2, a Trumpian nightmare of border-incursion, directed by Stefano Sollima. Sheridan and Sollima are reunited for this movie, but it is a by-the-numbers macho adventure not unlike something from the era of VHS rental, Rambo and tough-guy military mavericks being sold down the river by the pointy-headed creeps in suits back in Washington DC or Langley, home of the CIA.This film is based on Tom Clancy’s 1993 bestseller, originally set during the Vietnam war, but now updated to the situation in Syria. Michael B Jordan is Navy Seal John Clark, whose pregnant wife is murdered on US soil, apparently by FSB agents in revenge for John taking out Russian special forces in Aleppo as part of a hostage rescue. So Without Remorse becomes essentially an unidirectional revenge story, as John is permitted back into the field on a deniable “black ops” payback mission. His friend and ally Karen (Jodie Turner-Smith, from Queen & Slim) has John’s back and secretary of defense Clay (Guy Pearce) rather approves of his heroically unconventional methods – though slippery CIA chief Ritter (Jamie Bell) seems to be running some kind of side-hustle which involves appeasing the Russians. So whose side is this guy on?This is a film that certainly gives you bangs for your buck and establishment stabs in the back – a sine qua non for this kind of story. And with an awful inevitability, John Clark’s ultimate bad guy emerges from the shadows with some outrageous geopolitical monologuing in the approved supervillain style – prior to a post-credits sting setting up a possible superhero-type franchise along the lines author Tom Clancy envisioned. But there’s not much real spark to it. Tom Clancy’s Without Remorse is released on 30 April on Amazon Prime Video."
Sisters With Transistors review – an electrifying study of musical heroines,The unsung trailblazers behind electronic music are paid harmonic homage in Lisa Rovner’s enchanting documentary,5,"Lisa Rovner’s superb documentary pays a deeply deserved, seldom-expressed tribute to the female composers, musicians and inventors from the brief history of electronic music. The focus falls on about nine or 10 women in the field, from experimental music pioneer Clara Rockmore, a Theremin maestro in bias-cut evening dress, through to the British composer and mathematician Delia Derbyshire (probably best known for co-creating the Doctor Who theme), up to Suzanne Ciani, the first woman to score a major Hollywood movie (The Incredible Shrinking Woman in 1981) and her contemporary, composer and early software designer Laurie Spiegel.Each of them entered the field of electronic music from different paths. Unsurprisingly, several started out as classically trained musicians. Others did not: Daphne Oram, for instance, was originally a sound engineer at the BBC before went on to win scientific grants for her research and creating a method of writing on celluloid to score electronic sound.Although Rovner keeps the focus mostly on the women’s work and accomplishments, passing mention of some of the their biographical details points to a remarkable diversity. Pauline Oliveros, a founding member of the influential San Francisco Tape Music Centre, was an out lesbian and Wendy Carlos, who helped develop the Moog synthesiser and won fame for Switched-On Bach, was an early transgender pioneer.Indeed, the film touches on so many characters and ideas it could have been sliced up and rearranged in any number of ways without making gender the connective thematic thread. It could have accentuated the relationship between electronic music and other experimental art forms of the mid-20th century, or the overlap electronic music and technological innovation elsewhere. Rovner’s assiduous, often playful use of archive material points to connections between these musicians and 80s art-school punks such as Thurston Moore and Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth, 50s independent film-makers such as Shirley Clarke, 60s antiwar protestors and 70s Silicon Valley tech pioneers.Not that there’s anything to complain about regarding the woman-artist angle. In fact, a stray remark by contemporary composer Holly Herndon beautifully sums up the feedback loop of visible diversity and why it matters that female pioneers are honoured: “There is something psychological that happens when you can see yourself in the people who are being celebrated.” Surely it will only be a matter of time before someone uses this as inspiration for a biopic project or two, perhaps with Keira Knightley as the compelling Delia Derbyshire.Sisters with Transistors is released on 23 April in virtual cinemas."
Cielo review – love letter to the desert’s starry skies,Alison McAlpine’s documentary draws out tales from locals and astronomers to evoke the magic and mystery of Chile’s stargazing hotspot,3,"Cielo means “sky” in Spanish, and “heaven”, too. And it’s with a sense of humbled wonder at the immense mystery of it all that the Canadian film-maker Alison McAlpine casts her camera upwards in this beautiful documentary about the night sky. It’s filmed at the stargazing hotspot of Chile’s Atacama desert, where there is virtually no light pollution; the heavens appear to be within touching distance – as if a seam in the sky has been unpicked and the stars tumble out like diamonds.For those of us who live in urban areas, we look up from noisy streets and bright city lights to the vast emptiness of the sky. In Atacama, it’s the reverse; the sky seems more alive than the earth – a bare, Martian landscape of rock and sand. With her cinematographer, Benjamín Echazarreta, McAlpine shoots some astonishing time-lapse photography, which features alongside interviews with astronomers at the European observatories in the desert and locals who eke out a living somehow. One man is a UFO photographer; he thinks that humans are more evil than the aliens and, knowing this, the aliens don’t bother to land.This is a mellow, meandering film and, personally, I would have found a couple of explainers and captions to introduce the stargazers useful. The interviews with the astronomers are terrific; one of them explains that she’s not spiritual, and when she looks into the sky it’s the Earth she’s thinking about, how insignificant we humans are, how tiny in the universe, like ants. A local man movingly explains how his daughter, before she died, pointed to one of Orion’s stars and told him to remember her by it. On the other hand, the score of wind instruments and blippy electronic noises gives it a generic cine-essay feel, and McAlpine’s voiceover of poetic musings doesn’t help. At times this does feel like a bit of an unwitting test of the audience’s attention span. Cielo is available on 23 April on True Story."
Black Bear review – Aubrey Plaza hits career high in ingenious meta-movie,Social tensions spiral towards disaster before a cryptic rug-pull in this strange comedy gem,4,"Generally speaking, it’s a bit dismaying to find out that a movie is a movie within a movie, or that it’s somehow about itself, or a commentary on itself. The rug-pull isn’t enjoyable when the rug never felt very interesting or secure in the first place. But the meta gets better in Lawrence Michael Levine’s dizzying but gripping comedy Black Bear, which is a recurring nightmare – or rather, an entertainment in two acts about the messy business of making a personal film based on actual events. Is the movie being shot in the second act inspired by the events in the first? Or is the first act a film (or a dream, or a reverie) inspired by what happened in the second?Aubrey Plaza brings all her talent for droll and inscrutable irony to the role of Allison, a film-maker who arrives at a beautiful lakeside house for the weekend with the apparent intention of recharging her creative batteries and working on a script. We see her jotting notes on a legal pad, and her scribbled handwriting is the motif for the intertitles and credits. The house belongs to a handsome couple, Gabe (Christopher Abbott) and Blair (Sarah Gadon), who are friends of friends of Allison’s and have an informal policy of loaning their house to artistic people.From the start there is an uneasy frisson between the three. Allison establishes a wryly bantering tone which is dangerous for people who don’t know each other at all well; Blair can’t tell if she’s joking with her, or flirting with Gabe, and Gabe thinks Blair’s sudden need for wine is inappropriate given that she is pregnant.The drinking and arguing at dinner escalates to Burton and Taylor in Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf levels, as do Allison’s sulky provocations, clearly triggered by an attraction to Gabe. It all leads to a horrible denouement. But then Levine lowers the curtain, and raises it again to reveal Allison calmly seated once more in her one-piece bathing suit, gazing out over the water. Did we reset for another take? Yes and no. Now there is a different situation, different people, and a different crescendo of sexual unease.This new tone and the new expanded cast refreshes and invigorates the movie in an ingenious way: the tempo, the musical score, the new internal group dynamic make for a startling shift, and yet the relationship with what has gone before charges the action with significance. We are seeing a very dysfunctional family here – Black Bear has something of Truffaut’s Day for Night, as well as Alvy Singer in Annie Hall, directing theatrical scenes based on his own life and never quite satisfied.Importantly, the argument that led to disaster in the opening act was about gender roles: perhaps in a mood of contrarian ill-temper, Gabe had said that modern society’s abandonment of these roles had led to unhappiness. Astonished at this reactionary disloyalty, Blair accuses him of being anti-feminist but Allison brattishly agrees with Gabe. Yet it is Allison who is the film-maker, and who says she doesn’t care to see herself on screen. In the second act, however, we see Allison in an entirely different light: she is the actor and Gabe is her director.So who is in charge here? Who is the director? Or is Black Bear suggesting that, as the star, Allison has the power; she is directing what happens, especially as she is able to make script alterations at the last moment. This is Plaza’s best role yet, her cool feline sensuality achieving something more mysterious than anything in her previous work. And the Black Bear of the title inevitably takes more than one form: a nickname, a metaphor for sexual danger, an actual flesh-and-blood bear. It is symbol and reality: like the film itself, it’s a double-act with claws.Black Bear is released on 23 April on digital platforms."
The Seventh Day review – Guy Pearce’s hipster priest dices with the devil,Training Day meets the Exorcist in this satanic horror as a nattily dressed cleric reveals the ways of evil to a young acolyte,3,"As a Guy Pearce stan, I would happily watch him read a vacuum cleaner instruction manual for two hours. So there was a delicious thrill in discovering he co-stars in this reasonably compelling horror feature as a nattily dressed hipster priest, sporting a plaid coat that looks designed by Gucci.The idea is that Pearce’s character, Father Peter, learned the hard way during the pre-credits sequence just how nasty a business exorcism can be when he was an apprentice in the 1990s (the character played by Chris Galust for the purposes of a flashback) and saw a young boy burnt by the hellish force of evil. Fast forward to the present day, and Peter is assigned to teach a promising young pup fresh out of exorcism school, Father Daniel (Vadhir Derbez, a bit dull but pretty looking) how to handle demons.Their main quarry will be young Charlie (Brady Jenness, impressive), an adolescent boy who messed around with a Ouija board and ended up murdering his entire family with an axe. Poor Charlie is now locked up in an especially filthy-looking jail while he awaits trial, and Peter prods Daniel through the necessary steps he must take to reach the underlying evil that has engineered the situation. To reveal more would spoil the satisfying twist, but suffice it to say writer-director Justin P Lange finds a satisfying way to update the possession-exorcist theme for a new generation grown wary of the Catholic church’s old ways, particularly in the wake of the abuse scandals that have shredded the clergy’s credibility in recent years.In fact, the script might have gone a little further and put a bit more thought into exploring the collision between our expectations from horror as a genre and the real-world horrors inflicted on children accused of being “evil”. But this will do, especially as it’s a chance to watch Pearce and his remarkable cheekbones and gleeful weirdness at work with a scripture-chewing performance that puts a lot of meat on what could have been an off-the-peg turn from a lesser actor. The Seventh Day is released on 26 April on digital platforms."
Valley of Souls review –  quietly devastating Colombian drama,The tale of a fisherman’s quest to retrieve his sons’ bodies during Colombia’s reign of terror manages to find beauty and even tragicomedy amid the darkness,4,"“I thank those who have agreed to revisit these dark times,” reads the title card that closes this drama about a fisherman’s harrowing journey to retrieve the bodies of his two sons. Set in 2002, in the middle of the United Self-Defence Forces of Colombia’s (AUC’s) reign of terror, the film sees José (José Arley de Jesús Carvallido Lobo) drift downriver in his solitary canoe, scouring the debris that has washed up on the beach in search of clues. He knows it is forbidden to remove bodies from their unmarked grave – the otherwise gorgeous Magdalena river.José’s personal quest mirrors the political project of the Belgian-Colombian writer and director Nicolás Rincón Gille; both seek to preserve those who have disappeared under the AUC’s regime. It’s a devastating film, but doesn’t revel in the story’s inherent grimness. In one terrifying, tragicomic scene, José is brought face to face with a paramilitary chief who is obsessed with the Tour de France. Happily, his knowledge of this shared cultural reference ends up saving his life. Gille, who has a background in documentary film-making, pays particular attention to the natural beauty of the Bolívar region, choosing to foreground José’s stoicism instead of the way his life has been ravaged by violence. Lobo, too, is radiant, a pillar of strength holding steady amid a storm of grief.On Mubi"
Happy Happy Joy Joy: The Ren and Stimpy Story review – disturbing scenes,"There is little joy found in this warts-and-all profile of troubled animator John Kricfalusi, which traces alleged abuse and dysfunction in his former studio",3,"Here is a documentary whose title contains radioactive levels of irony: happiness and joy are very far from what is to be found within. It is a behind-the-scenes profile of the pioneering TV animation Ren and Stimpy, which for those not around in the early 90s, featured an angry chihuahua (Ren) and a dopey, good-natured cat (Stimpy); with its hyper-stylised visuals, bad-taste humour and eye-watering violence, it found a cult status as a mould-breaking kidult show – very much at the adult end of the scale.The film is built around a profile of John Kricfalusi, Ren and Stimpy’s creator and mastermind; presumably it started out as a warts-and-all account of Kricfalusi’s eccentric (to say the least) management style, which culminated in his firing by Nickelodeon in 1992, shortly after the show’s second season began. However, whatever intentions directors Ron Cicero and Kimo Easterwood may have had were upended by the emergence of even more serious accusations: claims of grooming and underage sex, for which he subsequently apologised. Faced with scrapping everything and starting again, Cicero and Easterwood have folded the material into the litany of alleged abusive behaviour in his studio: initially tolerated as mad-genius enthusiasm but evolving into nasty control-freakery. Kricfalusi is interviewed at length (he apparently agreed only after his victims went to the media), as is Robin Byrd, one of his principal accusers.The result makes for an unbalanced final film; even if Kricfalusi emerges as a thoroughly unpleasant, if damaged, character, giving him the room to apologise (again) for sexual abuse has the effect of suggesting that somehow that’s the end of it, and even that it was the result of aberrations triggered by workplace stress. Happy Happy Joy Joy is a dismal coda to a fondly remembered show, with Kricfalusi’s collaborators still distressed over what happened. As one of his co-workers put it: “No one else worked harder to fuck it up than this guy.” Happy Happy Joy Joy: The Ren and Stimpy Story is available on 16 April on True Story."
Ride or Die review – bloody revenge and blossoming love in shocking Japanese thriller,A young woman hits the road with the killer of her abusive husband in Ryūichi Hiroki’s adaptation of cult manga series,3,"The prolific director Ryūichi Hiroki has carved out a niche in modern Japanese cinema with his willingness to delve into the darker sides of sexuality. Following a start in the softcore “pink” films, He has moved to the mainstream while exploring subjects such as sadomasochism. Ride or Die, a live-action adaptation of Ching Nakamura’s arresting but disquieting manga series Gunjō, fits perfectly in the director’s transgressive wheelhouse.The moods of Ride or Die alternate between neon-lit cityscapes and sun-drenched open roads. The opening is shockingly baptised in blood: Rei (Kiko Mizuhara), a twentysomething lesbian, has slashed a man to death in his own home. It is later revealed that her victim is the abusive husband of Nanae (Honami Sato), a high-school classmate for whom Rei has held a torch for a decade. In perhaps the most destructive possible declaration of love, Rei has killed for Nanae, and together they embark on a getaway that doubles as a journey to their past. The bloodshed carries a poetic power: the life of a (bad) man is taken, only for the two women to see themselves reborn.Ride or Die is well-made and engrossing, despite its occasionally meandering pace. Texas-born Mizuhara, currently Japan’s most celebrated It girl, is hugely charismatic on screen. It is a pity that the film has damped down the pitch-black humour and sense of apathy found in its source material; the two women are designed to be much more obviously likable, their rough edges softened and the toxicity in their relationship diluted. The conspicuous use of easy listening tunes on the soundtrack doesn’t help, either.In the end though, Ride or Die boasts strong performances, and its beautiful cinematography takes viewers from metropolitan restlessness to the liberating seaside. Ride or Die is available on Netflix."
Ip Man: Kung Fu Master review – stylish martial arts potboiler,"Li Liming’s film takes itself a bit too seriously, but fight fans will enjoy the nifty and inventive combat scenes",2,"For those not up to date with the martial arts film canon, Ip Man was a real historical figure: a master of Wing Chun, a type of southern Chinese kung fu, who until relatively recently was best known for having trained the great Bruce Lee. The real Ip died just before Lee in 1972, but his colourful life has since served as a basis for a series of films that have taken varying amounts of liberty with the facts, starting with the Donnie Yen vehicle Ip Man from 2008.In these films, Ip is more than just a historical figure: he’s a legendary character, a fighter for justice against rogue criminals and sinister foreigners, especially in the films that focus on his years as a policeman in Foshan after the second world war, before the communists came to power and Ip and his family left for Hong Kong. Conversely, in Wong Kar-Wai’s The Grandmaster, Ip serves as a vehicle for a languorous contemplation of martial arts philosophy.Scads more have followed of varying quality, and this latest one features Dennis To, playing the character for the third time, in the Foshan policeman stage of the story. To be honest, To is a less engaging performer than Yen, but his moves are nifty and director Li Liming films the fight scenes – which really make up most of the movie – with plenty of style. Li is very keen on crosscutting between quiet and noisy interactions during the fights; in the opening battle, for instance, between Ip and dozens of axe-wielding gangsters, his superior officer (Michael Wong) plays chess upstairs against a foe with the moves in both forms of combat paralleling each other.There’s some ace drunken-style fighting later, and inventive use of props, but the film takes itself a bit too seriously and reshuffles the deck of plot tropes instead of inventing its own ideas. Ultimately, it feels about as meaningful as a pop video, but if you enjoy martial arts films the way others like, say, dance films, it’s pleasant viewing.Ip Man: Kung Fu Master is released on 19 April on digital platforms."
Sequin in a Blue Room review – illicit thrills in gay coming-of-age story,Conor Leach is remarkable as a schoolboy pursuing adult online hookups in this striking debut feature from Samuel Van Grinsven,4,"Sequin (the remarkably assured Conor Leach) is 16, but adds two years to his age to buy entry into an adult world of covert gay hookups. The no-strings connections he scrolls through on his phone during his English lessons exert a fascination which is thrillingly illicit; infinitely more exciting than the option of dates with lovesick boys his own age. Sequin’s only rule is that he never meets anyone twice. Then he encounters a handsome stranger in an anonymous sex party – located in the throbbing blue room of the title – and his quest to find the man reveals that, for all his poised appeal, Sequin is out of his depth.This feature debut from the Sydney-based writer and director Samuel Van Grinsven may tackle familiar material – gay coming-of-age stories are hardly uncommon – but it does so with a lustre and style that marks Van Grinsven out as a name to watch. Perhaps even more notable is Leach, a silky, feline presence who owns every moment that he’s on screen.On multiple VOD and virtual cinema platforms"
Sound of Metal review – Riz Ahmed excels as a drummer facing deafness,Riz Ahmed gives a career-best performance in an astonishing drama that’s rooted in reality and fully captioned for all,5,"In the 2020 drama Mogul Mowgli, co-writer and star Riz Ahmed played a British-Pakistani rapper struck down by a debilitating illness on the eve of his international breakthrough. In Sound of Metal, which premiered in Toronto in 2019, Ahmed plays an American drummer whose life is turned upside down by the onset of deafness. Stylistically these two films could not be more different; Sound of Metal is acutely realist with a docudrama edge, while Mogul Mowgli has been described as a “Sufi horror musical melodrama hybrid”. Yet both films are concerned with identity, a thorny issue with which Ahmed wrestled in the eye-opening 2020 short The Long Goodbye, and which runs through his finest work, including this remarkable Oscar contender.Ahmed is Ruben Stone, drumming with singer-guitarist Lou (Olivia Cooke) in the noise-merchant two-piece Blackgammon. They’re partners on and offstage, touring the US in a converted RV that doubles as a recording studio. But when Ruben’s hearing abruptly fails, he finds himself outside the bubble in which he has existed for so long.Having ignored medical advice to avoid loud sounds, recovering addict Ruben is guided by his sponsor, Hector, to a retreat run by Joe, brilliantly played by Paul Raci, the veteran stage and screen actor who is himself a child of deaf parents. Here, the possibility of a new life is offered. But will Ruben’s desperation to regain his hearing thwart future growth?Directed and co-written by Darius Marder, who made the 2008 treasure-hunter documentary Loot, Sound of Metal has its roots in an unfinished project by Derek Cianfrance, with whom Marder collaborated on the screenplay for The Place Beyond the Pines. Entitled Metalhead, Cianfrance’s uncompleted film was to have starred real-life sludge-metal duo Jucifer in a fictional story about hearing loss. The bones of that abandoned project were taken up by Marder, whose grandmother was deaf, and who co-wrote the Sound of Metal script with his musician brother, Abraham.With astonishing verisimilitude, Marder conjures a world in which every detail rings true. From the wall-of-noise ambience of Ruben’s rock performances (shot live, in front of real crowds) to heated group debates conducted in American sign language (ASL), Sound of Metal finds universal appeal in the specifics of detail, rooted in Ahmed’s thrillingly committed performance.“The deaf community taught me what it means to listen,” Ahmed has said, describing the physicality of signing – of using the whole body as an expressive tool. There’s something sublime about watching a performer of Ahmed’s calibre step up to the next level, as if his craft has been amplified by learning this new language. While Ruben may hide behind his words, Ahmed has never been more emotionally expressive than when communicating through ASL.There is a deft allusion in the title Sound of Metal to the distorted tonalities that beset Ruben when he turns (against Joe’s advice) to cochlear implants. Having brilliantly evoked Ruben’s experience of physical rather than aural vibrations (he can feel the drums, even if he cannot hear them), composer/sound designer Nicolas Becker and his team conjure a harsh electronic dissonance that seems to echo Ruben’s inner conflict. Just as addiction is a central theme, so Ruben’s desperate desire for surgery becomes a metaphor for a wider crisis of faith, an identity struggle embodied in the multilayered sound design.At times I was reminded of the 2014 Ukrainian drama The Tribe, which, for all its ultra-bleak nihilism, still captured the essence of a collectivist community, a community in which Ruben is welcomed and estranged. Like the underrated 2016 British masterpiece Notes on Blindness, which was released in audio-described and enhanced-soundtrack versions to maximise accessibility, so Sound of Metal is presented with open captions, meaning that in cinema screenings (remember those?) deaf and hearing audiences can experience the film together. That’s fitting for a film that deserves to be seen by the widest possible audience, reminding us of cinema’s unique ability to challenge, entertain, uplift and unite.

Palm Springs review – Groundhog Day with wedding bells on,This sharp time-loop romcom juggles fun and fatalism and resonates powerfully in the age of lockdown,4,"It’s an unexceptional wedding. Perhaps the cocktail bar aesthetic is a touch on the cheesy side. Perhaps there are a few sexual misadventures. Certainly a lot of beer is consumed, most of it by Nyles (Andy Samberg, excellent in a role that harnesses his comic talent but hones it into a performance of unexpected depth). But what is unusual is the location, next to a portal that leads to what Nyles nonchalantly describes as “one of those infinite time loops you might have heard of”. It’s a sly nod to the fact that cinema has been caught in this particular high concept before. But surface similarities to Groundhog Day are relegated to background noise, thanks to the crisp writing and the nihilistic bite of the humour.When we join the wedding, Nyles has already been caught in the loop for long enough to have relinquished hope and any pretence of giving a damn. But the endless inevitability is disrupted when Sarah (Cristin Milioti), sister of the bride and a velvet-eyed car crash of a woman, is sucked into the same repeated day. And the infinite grind of repetition suddenly takes on an element of fun.An insouciance of approach is evident in the film’s synthetic colour palette of Hawaiian shirt primaries and visual gags, such as the yin and yang placement of two inflatable pizza slices in a pool. But there are weightier themes. It’s a film about fatalism versus fierce and emphatic free will; settling versus risking it all. Covid brings an added resonance: what is true love, after all, if not actively aching to spend time with the person with whom you’ve been flung together for what seems like an eternity?On Amazon Prime"
Thunder Force review – Melissa McCarthy gets superstrength in rote superhero comedy,McCarthy and Octavia Spencer are childhood friends turned crime-fighting duo in this by-the-numbers comedy,2,"Melissa McCarthy’s moderate new superhero comedy vehicle stars McCarthy opposite Octavia Spencer, and is written and directed by her husband, Ben Falcone, who has a cameo as a hapless henchman called Kenny – the subject of what may or may not be a South Park gag.In an alternate universe where the US is threatened by super-villains called Miscreants, Lydia (McCarthy) is a big-hearted kid from Chicago who in high school protects a super-smart girl called Emily from bullies; they become best friends who lose touch in adulthood. Lydia grows up to be a lonely, boozy worker in a packing plant but Emily – now played by Octavia Spencer – becomes a tech zillionaire developing genetic treatments to turn ordinary people into superheroes. When Lydia drunkenly blunders into Emily’s lab, insisting on taking her to a class reunion, she accidentally plugs herself into the equipment and gives herself super-strength. And so exasperated high-achiever Emily figures they might as well team up to form Thunder Force, battling a Miscreant called Laser (Pom Klementieff – Mantis, from the Marvel Cinematic Universe), together with a bad guy called the King (Bobby Cannavale) and his associate the Crab, someone with pincers for arms – a role for Jason Bateman that again proves Bateman’s comically self-aware likability has never worked as well as it did in the role of Michael Bluth in TV’s Arrested Development.As ever, the comedy is mostly in the premise and the opening act when the heroine’s still-pristine loser status activates the irony and the laughs. From there on, the action needs a growing measure of seriousness, although there is some banter between the King, the Crab and the cringing henchmen subordinates, and a nice role for Marcella Lowery as Emily’s mum, hoping that Emily and Lydia might be a couple. This is by-the-numbers stuff, not quite funny enough for comedy or having enough of the crazed seriousness that marks out a successful superhero franchise. Thunder Force is out on 9 April on Netflix."
"Those That, At a Distance, Resemble Another review – meditation on the art and act of copying","This calm, painstaking visual essay explores how where copies and originals in an experimental film pregnant with ideas",3,"Artist and film-maker Jessica Sarah Rinland has authored a brief essay movie on the universal themes of the copy and the original. A copyist reproduces an original work of art, a museum conservator fabricates a damaged object with replacement materials. But the originals are arguably copies of ideas and genres within the artist’s mind, and the biological act of reproduction is an act of copying, from the DNA template.Rinland’s camera observes calmly, almost blankly, as the introduction of howler monkeys into the wild is discussed by zoologists – a habitat where they might breed – and this issue is juxtaposed with restoration work at the V&A, the Natural History Museum and the British Museum in London. An elephant tusk is copied as a plaster cast; confiscated tusks are used to restore a 19th-century ivory box, antiquities are painstakingly brought back to a version of their fundamental selves.It is intricate, meticulous work and Rinland follows it nearly in real time; it is an almost experimental procedure, although a series of titles at the very end make it clear exactly what we have been watching. The film is pregnant with ideas: I found myself thinking of Jean Baudrillard’s writings about the “simulacrum”, about a world with Elvis impersonators but no Elvis. As the ivory box is slowly restored to an approximation of its old self, we have the leisure to consider that this is an activity not very different from making it the first time around: both are from the same prototype, and that the time-lapse between the two has, in some sense, been abolished. Those That, at a Distance, Resemble Another is available on 6 April on Mubi."
Romeo and Juliet review – National Theatre's first film is an ingenious triumph,"Sky ArtsJosh O’Connor and Jessie Buckley captivate as the star-crossed lovers in a pacy, painterly and emotionally raw production",5,"The National Theatre’s first foray into film-making is a very different proposition to an NT Live recording. It is a production created solely for the screen. A note at the end tells us it was shot “on a single stage, over 17 days, during a global pandemic”. But no disclaimer is needed. Poised and adventurous, this Romeo and Juliet is a hybrid wonder and full of intelligent invention. Emily Burns’s adaptation is sleek and at times feels lean but that is a necessary sacrifice for tension and pace. Director Simon Godwin has given the film a remarkable sense of movement and played with theatrical artifice in deft ways.The opening shot shows the actors convening on the stage for rehearsals, props and dressing rails strewn around them, with the safety curtain in sight. Further in, rehearsal shots are incorporated into the production to remind us of the film’s mechanics but none of these elements seem laboured.One of the most powerful soliloquies, which features Juliet on the verge of drinking the potion that will bring on the semblance of death, features a circle of actors around her on stage. The scene retains all its emotional power, and we are not pulled away from Juliet’s inner state but brought closer. The actors in the blurred peripheries appear ghostly, as if she has already entered a different dimension.There are some constructed sets – drawing rooms and bedrooms – but the film looks best when characters are lit against its black backdrop, evoking the drama of old master paintings. Tim Sidell’s photography appears like a moving painting at times and Michael Bruce’s music is just as beautiful. Filmed on and around the Lyttelton stage, it has a claustrophobic feel that not only resonates with lockdown but also captures the choking sense of fate closing in on the young lovers.Only at times does it seem too poised, its characters sometimes lacking the messy emotional excesses that lead to the play’s many tragedies. Jessie Buckley, as Juliet, stands out as the film’s heart and soul. Intense and ardent, she is a strong, rebellious daughter who verges on the punkish, and even when she is at her most vulnerable never appears weak. Josh O’Connor comes out of the shadow of The Crown’s Prince Charles, the role for which he is best known, yet seems grave and emotionally coiled. But together they gel and their instant love, sparked at a modern-day party at the Capulets’, is captivating.Tamsin Greig’s Lady Capulet is a controlling mother: cold, imperious and a little too menacing. Other characters, from Fisayo Akinade’s passionate, gay Mercutio to Lucian Msamati’s Friar, Adrian Lester’s Prince and Deborah Findlay’s warmly clucking Nurse, are finely rendered.Commercially, the scale and resource of this venture can hardly serve as a blueprint for other theatres to follow, but artistically it is just exquisite. If this is a first venture into a pandemic-resistant revenue stream for the National, it sets the bar high. Romeo and Juliet is repeated on Sky Arts on 5 April and 8 April, and is on PBS in the US on 23 April."
The Mauritanian review – in limbo in Guantánamo with Tahar Rahim,This adaptation of a post-9/11 prisoner’s memoir is strong on procedural drama but blunted by stylised torture scenes,3,"When Nancy Hollander (Jodie Foster) arrives at Guantánamo Bay, she’s wearing sunglasses. Her chic white bob and blue button-down shirt are hardly provocative, but a guard advises her to wear a hijab anyway – the detainees have been known to spit at women. The moment recalls Foster’s trainee FBI agent Clarice Starling in The Silence of the Lambs, met with a different bodily fluid in the bowels of a psychiatric hospital.The Mauritanian, a post-9/11 legal drama based on Mohamedou Ould Slahi’s 2015 memoir Guantánamo Diary, is less concerned with the particular psychology of its incarcerated protagonist than with the political machinery that kept him behind bars without an official criminal charge for 14 years.The excellent Tahar Rahim (A Prophet) brings softness and seriousness to Slahi, but overripe flashbacks to his horrific torture are shot with a cartoonish edge. It’s a double bind: depict an interrogation scene too realistically and run the risk of torture porn, but veer too off-kilter and the effect is distancing. Here, the styling is at odds with the otherwise straightforward courtroom narrative. The prestige procedural elements work better; the real-life story is enraging, and it’s fun to see Benedict Cumberbatch’s morally conflicted military prosecutor lock horns with Foster’s icy human rights lawyer.

Undine review – romance with just enough magic and mystery,A woman on the rebound gets into deep water in Transit director Christian Petzold’s playful reworking of an age-old myth,4,"Writer-director Christian Petzold (Transit) riffs on the German myth of the water nymph whose love of a man secures her an immortal human soul. Undine (Paula Beer) is a historian in a leather jacket, her red hair recalling another Little Mermaid. “If you leave me, I’ll have to kill you,” she warns boyfriend Johannes (Jacob Matschenz), as per the fairytale. He dumps her anyway.Soon enough she has a new beau, a gorgeous industrial diver named Christoph (Franz Rogowski). The force of their initial attraction causes a fish tank to explode, soaking them to the skin. Undine gives lectures on Berlin’s changing architecture; this allows for neat parallels between a city haunted by the spectre of history and – like a gender-flipped Vertigo – our heroine tethered to the ghost of her past love.There’s just enough magic and mystery to tease out a supernatural reading of the film, though Petzold encourages viewers to find pleasure in puzzling out his femme fatale for themselves.Undine is on Curzon Home Cinema"
The New Gospel review – a thrilling and unsettling Easter story,Available onlineMilo Rau’s film mixes a dramatisation of the crucifixion story with a real-life portrait of exploited migrant workers ,4,"Milo Rau keeps you on your toes. On stage, the Belgium-based director is drawn to true stories often performed by non-actors playing themselves. In productions such as La Reprise, about a homophobic murder, and Familie, about a joint suicide, he blurs the line between fact and fiction in a way that unsettles and provokes. He doesn’t let you sit back.Thrillingly, he does the same thing on film. The New Gospel, available on the NTGent website this Easter weekend, is at once a dramatisation of the crucifixion story, a portrait of exploited migrant workers and a behind-the-scenes documentary. We don’t just get the last supper and the biblical quotes, we also see the auditions, the rehearsals and the material on either side of each take. It’s about what it means to tell the story as much as it is about the story itself.The scene is Matera in southern Italy, which, as well as being European capital of culture in 2019, served as a film set for Pier Paolo Pasolini’s The Gospel According to St Matthew and Mel Gibson’s The Passion of the Christ. A city that looks like it’s been chiselled out of the rock, it makes a good screen double for ancient Jerusalem.Rau’s version plays with that idea. The cinematography of Thomas Eirich-Schneider is poised and crisp as it focuses on the cast in their period tunics, looking rugged and authentic. But then it will pull back to show views through train windows, squalid refugee camps and a night-time railway station frequented by sex workers. Settling into the familiar Easter story isn’t an option.That’s politically important because Matera is home not only to the photogenic Sassi caves but also large numbers of migrant farm workers on poverty wages, living without electricity or water. Rau’s Jesus is Yvan Sagnet, a real-life activist organising a “revolt of dignity” on behalf of the disenfranchised labourers.As Jesus, he is passive, wise and accepting; as a campaigner, he is the voice of righteous anger. That he is also a rare black Jesus in European film history brings to notice another layer of injustice in a story that, 2,000 years on, has yet to lose its radical edge.The New Gospel is available online, 1–4 April."
Godzilla vs Kong review – duelling monsters make for one hell of a show,The two titans take each other on in a goofy and hugely enjoyable action adventure that delivers the big dumb thrills many of us have been craving,4,"The last two months of rabid meme-spawning ridicule aimed at the absurdity of Godzilla vs Kong’s very existence had prepped us all for a punchline rather than an actual movie, something to poke fun at rather than have fun with. It wasn’t just because of its inherent, Happy Meal tie-in silliness but also an awareness of what had come before, a young Warner Brothers cinematic universe precariously built on shoddy foundations. Gareth Edwards’s 2014 Godzilla might have boasted a couple of visually audacious sequences but it was mostly a rather unacceptably dull and bafflingly serious reboot. It was at least coherent, something that Michael Dougherty’s noisy 2018 sequel Godzilla: King of the Monsters couldn’t even manage, an unwieldy mess of a thing that was embarrassingly outdone by a canny marketing campaign.In-between the two, there was more to recommend in Jordan Vogt-Roberts’s Kong: Skull Island in 2017, which was uneven but mostly rather entertaining and surprisingly nasty, bolstered by a keener awareness of what tone a b-movie such as this needs to at least somewhat work. The films had attempted to lay the groundwork for an interconnected world of city-crushing monsters controlled by Monarch, a shadowy scientific organisation, but the convoluted cork board dot-connecting pushed us further away from the good stuff: watching giant creatures destroy things. The commercial failure of Godzilla: King of the Monsters – a film that barely covered its budget and marketing costs worldwide – was surely enough to make Warners second guess their expensive and extravagant MonsterVerse especially after a bullish decision to shoot Godzilla vs Kong before its predecessor had even been released.The tea leaves weren’t offering up much hope, dampened even further by the pandemic, a film designed for the biggest screen possible modestly unfurling for many of us at home instead (in the US it will be available on HBO Max and in cinemas and in the UK it’s a premium rental). But perhaps this unlikely underdog positioning has ultimately come to Godzilla vs Kong’s rescue because what was initially seen as a bloated and unwanted piece of boardroom product has now become a scrappy little contender, fighting its way from far beneath sea level up to the surface, triumphantly landing on both feet, the striking spring surprise none of us had expected.After the overstuffed and underwritten jumble of Godzilla: King of the Monsters, which links directly to the plot here, it’s a pleasure to see the surer hand of horror director Adam Wingard leap over any similarly soapy setup (he quickly realises we give only the slightest of damns about the humans) and throw us directly into the action, which then barely relents for the ensuing almost two-hour runtime. It’s not that Godzilla vs Kong isn’t also overstuffed but as a whole it’s a more graceful beast, dotting from one plot thread to the other with speed and agility, a proudly defined b-movie that picks goofiness over the strange self-serious pretentiousness that suffocated the Godzillas that came before it. The plot is, of course, just a frantic way to justify why the two titans would come to blows (both had been positioned as protectors of humanity in previous films) and their beef is down to a mysterious threat that is somehow connected to Apex Industries, a company whose headquarters is attacked by a previously dormant Godzilla in the first act. His destructive reappearance leads to global concern that he may now be more foe than friend and so Kong, living in a controlled tech simulation within Skull Island, is recruited to help by leading a group of humans on a deep dive to the core of the Earth, the specifics of which are too silly to get into and also of lesser interest than the main question most readers will have: how are those fight scenes?While the misleadingly magnificent trailers for Godzilla: King of the Monsters teased a film of immersive action and sweeping, surreal beauty, the film itself offered up confusing choreography, ugly editing and an inability to turn a single stunning image into a sequence of note. Despite genre inexperience, You’re Next and Death Note director Wingard quickly grasps the mechanics of action far quicker and with each of the many, many set-pieces that come, he’s able to keep us grounded while in the middle of chaos, allowing us to follow and feel a part of the manic smashing and crashing (something the first Pacific Rim also struggled to do). The much-hyped battles deliver the giddy thrills we demand but in the moments when the pair aren’t at war there’s also a staggeringly well-built and extensive universe to explore and one that’s barely been teased in the trailers we’ve seen. The journey to the core of the Earth is a film in itself and while visual touches are cribbed from both Star Wars and Tron franchises, it’s all so remarkably handsome that it’s hard to complain.The humans are obviously of minimal importance (the finale in particular is jaw-droppingly callous in its destruction of an entire city and its inhabitants) but the script, from the Marvel writer Eric Pearson and the MonsterVerse stalwart Max Borenstein, uses the film’s ensemble mostly well, they propel things along without dragging them down. There’s no time for romance between Rebecca Hall’s anthropological linguist and Alexander Skarsgård’s geologist or between Millie Bobby Brown’s Godzilla-stanning teen and her friend Julian Dennison and while Brian Tyree Henry’s conspiracy theorist podcaster does get lumped with comic support, it’s breezy enough not to get annoying. The most impactful human character is played by deaf actor Kaylee Hottle, playing a girl who shares a bond with Kong, whose scenes come closest to giving the film some sort of heart.But ultimately it works best when operating on the grandest scale imaginable and while there’s a bittersweet tinge for those of us watching it at home, it’s already serving as a reminder why the big screen experience will never go away. This past week, it set a global box office record for a film released during the pandemic (in many territories where cinema-going has returned to a semblance of normality, it’s receiving a standard theatrical release), a welcome boost to an industry suffering an existential crisis. So while, yes, Hollywood and Warner Brothers may end up being the biggest winners in the battle of Godzilla vs Kong, it’s a genuine surprise to report that we, as viewers, also emerge as victors. The last laugh shall be a roar.Godzilla vs Kong is available on HBO Max and in US cinemas from 31 March and to rent digitally in the UK from 2 April"
Undine review – a shaggy catfish of a story about a woman with a water obsession,The director of Transit returns with a somewhat pointless film about an art historian who has a passionate affair with a diver,3,"Christian Petzold’s Undine is an intriguing, bemusing oddity of a film: a suspense drama-thriller with a fey supernatural twist. It’s a sphinx that, if not exactly without a secret, has less of a secret than it thinks it has. And it is possible to come away from the film less than convinced, but very impressed by the sheer force of Petzold’s film-making talent (recently so stunning in his drama Transit) but which has been here deployed for something which is a bit flimsy and silly.Paula Beer plays Undine who, as her name suggests, may have intense sympathies with water. She lives in Berlin, and is a stylish and elegant historian who lectures on the city’s architectural history at the Berlin City Models exhibition. But she is also conducting an unhappy adulterous affair with Johannes (Jacob Matschenz), which is reaching its unhappy end at the film’s opening - revealing a flash of something angry and even violent in Undine.But in the midst of this traumatic episode, Undine is to have a fateful encounter with a strange man who has heard her lecture, and appears to be in love with her. This is Christoph, an underwater diver played by Franz Rogowski - a sensual screen presence with a little of Joaquin Phoenix. Soon Undine and Christoph are having a passionate affair, and he introduces her to his mysterious professional world, little guessing that she may be far more at home in it than he ever could be.Their relationship is passionately sensual, though Undine is perplexed at the sheer rapture with which Christoph listens to her lectures about Berlin’s planning history. Is there a metaphorical dimension to this? Maybe. Certainly their emotional connection has restored something like happiness to her, and effaced the mad furious unhappiness of her former liaison. But then she is to chance across Johannes once again and a terrible destiny begins to stir in those watery depths with which Undine feels such empathy.In truth, Undine is a bit of a shaggy dog story, or maybe a slimy giant catfish story; though it is just so skilfully made, beautifully acted and directed. Rogowski brings something unstable and dangerous to the part and so, in a more contained way, does Beer. What might this cast and this director do if they were working on a more compelling and substantial story? As it stands, Undine is a diverting and handsomely crafted piece of fantasy.

Wilderness review – young lovers' lost weekend,"This tender, absorbing portrait of new lovers tested by events on a romantic trip is a remarkable production, with terrific chemistry from the leads",3,"Here’s an interesting project from the film school at Falmouth University: a low-budget drama put together by four film-makers – including director Justin John Doherty and screenwriter Neil Fox, a Falmouth lecturer – with professional actors but otherwise crewed entirely by student first-timers skipping the intern phase. The result is rather lovely, a talky cine-literate portrait of a new relationship set in the 1960s. (I’m not sure you could make such an uncynical film about a couple falling in love in the present day.) It reminded me a little of Blue Valentine, without the messy raw bits, or the divorce – basically before Ryan Gosling gets a beer gut.There’s a nice emotional fluency to James Barnes’ performance as John, a thoughtful jazz musician who drives with his new girlfriend Alice (Katharine Davenport) to a cottage by the sea for the weekend. There is terrific chemistry between the pair; they can’t keep their hands off each other. But John has a gnawing fear that it won’t last, that love will fade. Alice is sunnier-natured, a bit careless of other people’s feelings.There are two crisis episodes over the weekend. John takes Alice for dinner at the house of old friends, another couple, who have left London. The husband Charlie (Sebastian Badarau) is a drummer who has given up touring to teach. Nothing much happens but it emerges that John hasn’t been honest about how well he knows the wife Francis (Bean Downes). Feeling betrayed, Alice ruthlessly flirts with both Charlie and Francis to punish him. Hungover the next day they get stranded on the beach as the tide comes in.Everything plays out in absorbing emotional detail. My only reservation with the film is how tasteful it is – from Alice’s chic boyish haircut to the Scandi-chrome coffee pot and the sweat-free sex. And it’s out of politeness perhaps that the film avoids the issue of race. John is black, and Alice is white, and there’s a nasty incident on the beach when a dog tramples their picnic. Its owner, a tweed-capped toff, is blatantly racist; it’s as clear as daylight. The couple talk about everything, but not this? Wilderness is released on 5 April on digital platforms."
Nobody review – Bob Odenkirk betters John Wick in fun action caper,The Better Call Saul star gets a furiously entertaining star vehicle playing a suburban father who finds himself up against the Russian mob,4,"For any vaguely fit actor over the age of 50, being given your own Taken was briefly seen as an enviable career boost, a chance to relive former glories, a slickly choreographed leap from an early Hollywood grave back to the sandlot. Ever since Liam Neeson swapped emoting for punching back in 2008, Kevin Costner, Sean Penn, John Travolta, Pierce Brosnan and Guy Pearce all tried to do the same but audiences wisely stayed away from their sub-par shoot-em-ups and execs were forced to realise that, duh, it’s the star rather than the sub-genre that people are magnetically drawn to. Because Neeson’s shtick was continuing to bring in solid crowds while his peers were flailing and in 2014, Keanu Reeves found a similar sweet spot with John Wick, kicking off a hugely profitable new series with a Taken-adjacent combination of simple action plot and much-loved actor.With a burning desire for some of that Wick cash (the three films in total have made over $550m worldwide with a spin-off and TV series also planned), Universal has teamed up with the film’s writer Derek Kolstad to crack open what’s clearly hoped to be a new low-budget, high-profit action universe. This time the choice of lead is based less on conventional desirability and more on unconventional durability with Better Call Saul’s Bob Odenkirk as an unassuming suburban dad hiding a dark past in Nobody, a furiously entertaining thriller that, for me, worked far more effectively than any of Keanu’s outings, a bit more character thrown in to cushion the many broken bones.The unusual career of Odenkirk, who in his 50s has experienced an unlikely transformation from “oh that guy” character actor to Emmy-nominated lead of a hit show, makes him a compelling action hero, confident enough to command yet with a skillset that’s more extensive and more versatile than just pure physicality. He plays the improbably named Hutch Mansell, a milquetoast everyman whose daily routine has grown as tired as his chilly marriage. When his house is set upon by a couple of low-rent thieves, he’s set on a mission to right a wrong, revealing an adeptness for violence that’s been kept far away from his family.It’s a film cooked up from some overly familiar ingredients (as well as the blood and bullets, there’s challenged masculinity, the Russian mob, a cute pet, some noirish voiceover etc) yet Kolstad, along with Hardcore Henry director Ilya Naishuller on vibrant form, finds a way to make it all feel oddly vital. There’s a simple, shaggy charm to watching Hutch rediscover his particular set of skills, kicked off by a fantastically well-designed bus sequence that sees him scrappily take on a group of obnoxious younger men. He’s an imperfect yet resilient fighter, believably hampered by age, making him a character far more thrilling to watch than say, any one of Neeson’s no-stakes superheroes.The escalation that follows which dominoes one good deed into one savage fight into something far greater helps Nobody avoid the storytelling-by-numbers trap that so many revenge films often fall into, mimicking a video game with the hero going from one end-of-level boss to the next. The fight scenes are also awfully effective, a jolt of brutal violence captured with a specificity that allows us to keep up with every punch and kick, a base-level competency that so many action films fail to master. Perhaps the film’s greatest ace is its relative lack of smugness, Kolstad’s script briskly racing ahead without wasting time to stand back and remark on how smart and ironic it all is, quips kept to a minimum, a lesson other action screenwriters could do with learning.Odenkirk is a surprisingly physically adept anchor and while sure, the trope of a man only really being a man when he embraces his violent side is … not great, he tries his best to work around the regressive nature of the genre, turning Hutch into a man somewhat earnestly trying to figure out the right balance of alpha and beta. There’s little to do for Connie Nielsen as his confused wife but Christopher Lloyd gets to have some fun as his gun-toting father and along with RZA as his equally armed brother, there’s an intriguing little family dynamic that will probably be explored in the inevitable sequel (Nobodies, perhaps?).It’s all very been here, seen that yet there’s something infinitely pleasing about a film doing very little but doing it very well, knowing just how high to aim without aiming any higher, aware of exactly what it can and can’t do. In a tight 91 minutes, without any bloat, Nobody gives us exactly what we want.Nobody is out in US cinemas on 26 March with a UK release in June"
Nemesis review – geezer cliche compilation with a charisma bypass,The Bill’s Billy Murray is a cockney hardman whose ordeal of a family dinner party gets inflicted on us too in this terrible thriller ,1,"If Towie put out a crime special it might look a bit like this shoddy London thriller about an ageing gangster whose plans for a peaceful retirement go south. The characters have that same style of stiff, awkward delivery, as if they’re speaking lines to each other over a dodgy Zoom link.The star is TV mainstay Billy Murray (The Bill and EastEnders) who plays John Morgan, a gang boss with the telltale mahogany suntan of a cockney hardman done good. Morgan, semi-retired in Turkey, flies into London on a private jet for a charity fundraiser. But on the night there’s a spot of bovver with an old foe, alcoholic detective Frank Conway (Nick Moran). Morgan and his wife Sadie (Jeanine Nerissa Sothcott) have also arranged a dinner to meet their Instagram influencer daughter’s new girlfriend – and there’s a horrifically sleazy scene when the girlfriend arrives early to find Sadie wearing only knickers.Murray plays villain Morgan with the menace of a bag of spinach wilting soggily at the back of the fridge – it’s almost as if his contract has stipulated a charisma bypass is a condition for the part. And everything is let down by the script, which feels cobbled together from geezerish cliches. “You’re like a British bulldog,” an associate growls at Morgan. “You’re proud, defiant, tenacious, old-school. But there comes a time in every animal’s life when it needs to be put down.”In the third act, the family dinner party turns into a home invasion nightmare that is an ordeal for all the wrong reasons. Meanwhile, copper Conway is downing whiskies in a gentrified East End boozer, getting all riled up for revenge. A twist at the end of the meal is ludicrous. In cockney rhyming slang, this is pony and trap. Nemesis is released on 29 March on digital platforms."
The Banishing review – Jessica Brown Findlay shines in standard spooker,The Downton Abbey actor holds together Christopher Smith’s increasingly silly Essex haunted-house horror,3,"“An empire of misogyny” is how former Irish president Mary McAleese described the Catholic church – and Christianity as a historical perpetrator of sexism and violence against women adds an interesting-ish layer or two to this otherwise run-of-the-mill but well-acted haunted-house horror. It’s set in the runup to the second world war and loosely inspired by Borley Rectory, the country manor once dubbed “the most haunted house in England”.Downton Abbey’s Jessica Brown Findlay is terrific as Marianne, a vicar’s wife with a rebellious streak (her bohemian “loose woman” past becomes crucial later). Marianne has just moved into a crumbling pile in the Essex countryside with her wet blanket husband Linus (John Heffernan) and their young daughter Adelaide (Anya McKenna-Bruce). The local bishop Malachi (John Lynch), a man who wears the huge gold cross around his neck like gangster’s bling, is clearly not to be trusted. And pretty soon things are going clank in the night.The film’s scares feel pretty standard, with nothing new to add to the gothic haunted house canon. Marianne hears voices wailing in the walls; her daughter finds a creepy Victorian doll with gaping black holes where its eyes have been gouged out. Nevertheless, director Christopher Smith turns the screws with malevolent precision: scenes in which Marianne and little Adelaide see their doppelgangers reflected in a mirror are genuinely unnerving, as are Marianne’s violent hallucinations.It all gets very silly, and there’s a naff go-nowhere storyline involving Nazis. But Brown Findlay holds it together with her performance of Marianne as the sort of woman who marches no-nonsense into the dark basement brandishing a torch to take on the ghosts of mad monks. The Banishing is released on 26 March on digital platforms."
Feedback review – Eddie Marsan thriller on the wrong frequency,Marsan plays a lefty radio presenter under siege – but there is an awful lot of unconvincing plot and incongruous violence here,1,"This contrived, nasty and uninteresting horror-thriller is a waste of its star Eddie Marsan. He plays Jarvis Dolan, a late-night radio presenter of lefty views, sort of like James O’Brien, with a bit of Piers Morgan’s provocation. His career is in crisis, having only just survived a kidnapping from a shadowy group of Brexity rightwing extremists. The station’s oleaginous boss Norman (a cameo from Anthony Head) insists that Jarvis now lightens the broadcasting mood by getting reunited with his old double-act partner, Andrew Wilde (played by Peaky Blinders’ Paul Anderson), a boozy, jokey wild man that Jarvis can’t stand these days. But hardly have they got together for their first show than they are attacked by terrifying masked individuals who lock them in the studio, forcing them to stay on the air, because they are obsessed with a certain something in Jarvis and Andrew’s past.All the buildup turns out to be tiringly irrelevant to the attack itself, which revolves around an event from 10 years ago, in circumstances that don’t seem at all convincing for people who are supposed to be late-night radio presenters, not rock stars. The movie is supposed to deliver claustrophobic tension and thrills, a little like Assault on Precinct 13, perhaps.But there is a weird lack of plausible plot involvement, and also a disconcerting amount of implausible plot development. Who would have thought that a radio studio actually had a sort of trapdoor in the side leading to possible escape from the building? And then there are flourishes of horrible violence that don’t mesh with the rest of the film. You might find yourself tuning out. Feedback is released on 26 March on digital platforms."
Killing Escobar review – the hard men behind  plot to kill drug lord,Mercenaries Peter McAleese and David Tomkins tell the story and backstory behind their contract on the Colombian kingpin,3,"Here’s a documentary that shines a light on squalid corner of British post-imperial legacy: the batches of mercenaries – largely former military personnel – who roamed the world’s trouble spots in the 70s and 80s, killing for hire in numerous civil conflicts in Africa and Latin America. (As this film suggests, these ex-SAS types weren’t politically neutral: they were actively keen on killing communists in places like Angola and Rhodesia.)The film focuses on an escapade that is – ethically speaking – a little less murky than cold war Africa: a plot to assassinate the super-powerful Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar in the late 1980s. However, since it was organised at the behest of another super-powerful Colombian drug lord, any claims to the moral high ground are not really supportable.The principal interviewees here are Peter McAleese, a former paratrooper who grew up in Glasgow and was responsible for the military activities of the assassination squad, and the somewhat more dapper David Tomkins, the man who organised the contracts and who by his own account moved enormous amounts of arms into conflict zones.McAleese and Tomkins relate the story of their mission efficiently enough. We know it is doomed to fail, as history tells us Escobar was shot dead a few years later, in 1993, by a Colombian police unit. Presumably to crank up the narrative tension, director David Whitney adds a series of reconstruction-flashback scenes of McAleese, alone and injured in the Colombian rainforest. With little signposting, they slow down the film’s momentum, even if we eventually learn where they fit in in the bigger scheme of things. It all seems rather affable until a shipment of weapons turns up: the gun lust on show underscores the abhorrent nature of the enterprise.Rather like a veteran ex-football hooligan, McAleese is heroically frank about his propensity for violence as he fills in his backstory, offering up as evidence his rough Glaswegian upbringing next door to Barlinnie prison (he points out the cell window from which his hardman father would signal when he was doing time). On some level, McAleese’s scorn for his former self is a reasonably creditable attempt to confront the consequences of the destruction he has caused, even if there is an evasiveness about the way he focuses on failings in his personal life rather than his victims, in Africa or elsewhere. At 79, he’s still a scary individual. Killing Escobar is out now on digital platforms."
The War with Grandpa review – De Niro slums in delayed ex-Weinstein farce,The two-time Oscar winner sleepwalks through a throwaway family film about duelling relatives that also wastes Uma Thurman and Christopher Walken,2,"For a film as cursed as family comedy The War with Grandpa, shot back in 2017 then sidelined and sold as a result of Harvey Weinstein’s downfall, it’s a very minor victory to report that rather than being bad, it’s merely bland, an adequate milquetoast time-waster for a very young and very undiscerning audience. What makes that description slightly harder to stomach is the unusually stacked cast – two-time Oscar winner Robert De Niro, Oscar winner Christopher Walken, Oscar nominee Uma Thurman – whose combined star power gently lifts rather than carries a film that’s leagues beneath them.It’s glumly become the sort of sleepwalk role we now expect of De Niro, an actor with an ever-diminishing batting average, whose note-perfect performance in last year’s The Irishman was more exception than rule. He’s returning to the titular role of Grandpa, after shagging and swearing his way through Dirty Grandpa, to play a PG-rated technology-hating, wife-grieving cipher of a man whose latest misadventure (stealing food after losing his cool with a supermarket self-checkout – groan) has his daughter (Thurman) insist that he comes to stay with her family. But a shortage of rooms means that he has to turf grandson Peter (Oakes Fegley) out of his bed, sending him to the attic, leading to a farcical, yet low-stakes, battle of escalating pranks.Based on the book by Robert Kimmel Smith, there’s a decent kernel of an idea here and the script, from writing partners Tom J Astle and Matt Ember, briefly flirts with something more substantial, at least in the first act. An unmoored and displaced grandparent is understandably reluctant to allow himself to be taken care of and there are a few quiet moments, nicely played by De Niro, that show a man struggling to find his place in a world without his wife. But by the third time we see him pick up a framed photo of his dearly departed, we start realising that creativity is in short supply along with characterisation and the film falls into a repetitive back-and-forth between the duelling relatives.It’s slickly made by longtime family film director Tim Hill and there’s a decent enough budget to give it a sheen so often missing from its streaming equivalents but there’s no amount of gloss that can distract from its one-note vacuity, something even its high-wattage cast can’t fix. There’s no longer any novelty in seeing De Niro goof around in a series of slapstick scenarios and instead, it’s rather depressing especially given the lack of ingenuity on display here (he accidentally flashes his son-in-law twice). He’s as bored as we are and while Thurman gives it a bit more effort, it’s also embarrassing to see her act the clown for a film as rote and unnecessary as this. Watching them, along with Walken, trudge their way through this kind of slop, all one can hope is that their paycheques were worth it and that their upcoming slates allow for some swift redemption.Even when a film is aimed at such a young, undemanding audience, there are still ways to elevate but Astle and Ember keep things base-level, defiantly ignoring the enjoyment of anyone over the age of 12 and giving those within its target demographic very little that feels unique or even vaguely amusing. The “war” at its centre is too benign to register, each prank dumber than the last, and the whole film is scuppered by a major plot hole: that somehow despite loud, property-destroying acts of aggression, no one else in the family notices their feud until the very end.The fact that The War with Grandpa finally dragged itself off from the shelf is something of a win but now that we’re able to see it, the real loser is us.The War with Grandpa is now out in cinemas in the US with a UK date to be announced"
Creation Stories review – mythmaking and megalomania in likable Alan McGee biopic,Irvine Welsh’s cracking adaption of an autobiography by the ‘President of Pop’ flashes from My Bloody Valentine to his discovery of Oasis,3,"“I’m talentless. But I make things happen.” That’s record label supremo Alan McGee speaking. It’s not remotely true: his taste is his talent. In the 80s and 90s, McGee put out records by the Jesus and Mary Chain, My Bloody Valentine, Primal Scream and Teenage Fanclub. Now comes a biopic: a lairy, likable film directed by Lock Stock actor Nick Moran.Creation Stories is co-written by McGee’s mate Irvine Welsh and Dean Cavanagh, who have adapted McGee’s 2013 autobiography. And it’s the cracking script that is the star here, giving McGee just enough working-class gobshite cheekiness (“I’m just a wee ginger tool from Glasgow”) to balance out the myth-making and megalomania. (This is a man who had a sign on his desk that read: “President of Pop”.)McGee said in a recent interview that he vetoed Ewan McGregor playing him in the film because the actor is too good looking. Instead, the role went to another, less Hollywood Trainspotting alumnus, Ewen Bremner, whose portrayal is spot-on. There’s a brilliant scene where the bailiffs come knocking at the offices of McGee’s label Creation Records. He is on the phone trying to stave off creditors: “I’ve got a new band. They’re gonna be bigger than U2.” It’s total rubbish, but he uses the line again and again – and in the end it comes true.In 1993, McGee discovers Oasis at King Tut’s in Glasgow. Welsh’s script hilariously downplays this life-changing signing: McGee is only at the venue because he missed a train to London, while Oasis – total unknowns – are not even on the bill, but blag their way on stage. (“It’ll give the DJ 20 minutes for a shite,” says the venue’s manager.) The actors playing bands in the Creation stable look the part – the Gallagher brothers may have been cast for their eyebrows alone – but don’t get much screen time.In flashbacks, Leo Flanagan does a good job playing McGee as a teenager. Transformed by watching the Sex Pistols on TV he starts a band in his bedroom with a mate from school, Bobby Gillespie (later of Primal Scream). Director Moran doesn’t go too deep, not dwelling on the beatings heaped on McGee by his dad, or the nine months he spent getting clean in 1994. This can leave the characters feeling a bit two-dimensional, but the inspired chaos feels right.In another terrific scene, McGee bursts into a studio where My Bloody Valentine are recording Loveless – an album that took so long to record it almost bankrupted Creation. After the band has McGee ejected by security, he kicks off and ends up in the back of a police car ranting about frontman Kevin Shields (“that money-spunking mad genius”).In 1992, McGee sold 49% of Creation to Sony, and later nudged Britpop into bed with Tony Blair, before becoming disillusioned with New Labour in power. Blair is played here as smarmy and insincere; Cherie is sharper, but Alastair Campbell will surely be unhappy with the portrayal of him gormlessly toe-tapping away to the house-lite election anthem Things Can Only Get Better. And can it really be true that McGee left Chequers in horror at Jimmy Savile being a dinner guest all the way back in 1999? Creation Stories is available on Sky Cinema from 20 March. This article was amended on 25 March 2021. The actor playing the young Alan McGee is Leo Flanagan, not Liam as originally stated."
Russian Raid review – hostile takeover of screens in steroidal martial arts actioner,Hooligans are up to all sorts of impish mayhem in this rote action flick apparently modelled on The Raid,2,"Russia’s hooligan set will have a new Friday-night post-pub favourite with this martial arts film, modelled on Gareth Evans’s The Raid. In a literal hostile takeover, former Spetsnaz sniper Nikita (Ivan Kotik) leads a squad of tracksuited casuals into a vodka factory/mafia front on behalf of a shady businessmen (Ilya Antonenko) looking to seize it – but he also has a personal beef with the owner.For reasons half-explained, the squad are forbidden from carrying guns, and the chief heavy (played by real-life MMA fighter Vladimir Mineev) chafes against Nikita’s command from the off. They work their way up through the factory’s security to the C-suite, with much fisticuffs, mostly in the fashionable MMA style – with heavy emphasis on grappling and backhanded slaps that look prissy but probably aren’t. The standout is a corridor-hemmed brawl against three juggernauts wielding a host of medieval weaponry, with director Denis Kryuchkov often keeping us locked in with the combatants with swaying, reeling Steadicam.But introducing firearms halfway through, when the factory’s true owners enter the fray, works to somehow lower the stakes. As more parties become involved, the already poorly defined relationships between the characters become get more confusing – including what white-suited secretary (Sofya Ozerova) is doing there other than providing openings for misogynistic jeopardy. (She’s given an empowering assault rifle later.)The initial tone of impish mayhem shifts into something grim and rote, ill-serving frontman Kotik. Interestingly lithe, aloof and not overly macho, he has obvious star chops – breaking out in some fights into footwork drawn from the Russian folk dancing he does in one childhood flashback. “Balletic” used to be the adjective of choice for John Woo’s action films, and Kotik is clearly primed to deliver this in material that is more than this steroid party. Russian Raid is released on 22 March on digital platforms."
Artes Mundi review – around the world in richly absorbing art,"From lush Dominican political surrealism to black US history and a Japanese tragedy revisited, the Welsh biennial shortlist sweeps the globe – online and over three venues in Cardiff",0,"Artes Mundi is a biennial exhibition crowned with an award (at £40,000 the largest art prize in Britain). It has brought international art to Wales since 2004 and has a reputation for pitch-perfect judgment. Previous winners have included the American art star Theaster Gates and the Ghanaian-born filmmaker John Akomfrah, whose beautiful two-screen elegy for migrants won the seventh edition. On 15 March the ninth edition will open to the world online, and from May it is scheduled to open across three galleries to Cardiff visitors in person. The winner will be announced on 14 April.The global sweep this time reaches from Puerto Rico to India, and from South Africa to Japan. The best-known name by some way is the veteran African American photographer Carrie Mae Weems (born 1953), so famous she appears as herself in Spike Lee’s Netflix adaptation of She’s Gotta Have It. The younger artists include Prabhakar Pachpute, born in Maharashtra in 1986, and Firelei Báez from the Dominican Republic, barely 40 but already the recipient of several awards for her paintings. Indeed the six-strong shortlist arrives heavily pre-garlanded.Weems’s work appears both within and without the gallery walls. Above the entrance to the Chapter arts centre hangs a larger-than-life image of black people holding hands, along with an exhortation not to worry because we’ll all be doing it again once the pandemic is over. Inside are further photographs of humanity, the size of billboards, pressing forward in arresting unanimity.At the National Museum of Wales, you can see photographs from Weems’s celebrated Constructing History series, in which students, who were not yet born at the time, act out tragic tableaux from US history. From the mourning of Martin Luther King to the assassinations of JFK and Malcolm X, these scenes are instantly recognisable and yet remote as nativity plays from our sense of what actually happened. All we can do is keep trying to remember – and, perhaps, to look closer at the over-used image.This is the point of Repeating the Obvious, an installation that presents the same photograph – of an African American youth in a hoodie – 39 times over in different sizes. You can’t quite make him out, in the shadowy blue mugshot. But heck, runs the sardonic unspoken caption, aren’t they all the same in any case?Firelei Báez is also concerned with black history, specifically that of the Caribbean. Her canvases, vast and small, operate a kind of prose-poetry double-take. She reproduces existing images – maps, floor plans, documentary photographs, the covers of controversial books on slavery and race – and overpaints them with wildly gestural visions.So the black-and-white photograph of a sinister US institute for forced labour bursts into neon flames. An old imperial map showing the uncharted Atlantic, complete with antique ships and absolutely no sense of geography, is dominated by a magnificent quasi-mythological female creature of fur and feathers, palms and ferns, rearing up out of the waves.The impulse is didactic, but the visions are gorgeous flights of fantasy: a kind of late-flowering political surrealism. Báez is an inventor of fictions to fell racists and bureaucrats. I look forward to seeing more of her work.If you detect a theme, here, it certainly continues with the slow and mildly hypnotic films of the Puerto Rican artist Beatriz Santiago Muñoz (born 1972). But Muñoz is more tuned to melancholy. The sadness of the seas, the lone fisherman, the submerged history of oppressed islanders: all are fluidly connected in her film installation.Artes Mundi’s digital presentation gives too little sense of the lush complexities of Muñoz’s work, with its ethno-eco-political interleafings. But so it is, alas, with configurations of objects, projectors and multiple screens in darkened rooms. And I’ve no doubt that the array of objects in South African-born multimedia artist Dineo Seshee Bopape’s installation – a grass mat, a folded Welsh blanket, heaps of wood ash – carry a presence in reality unavailable from images. But anyone who has seen her works with soil and brick know that they have a strong sculptural grace.Bopape (born 1981) has covered the walls with small landscapes worked in washes of soil and clay from Africa, America and Britain. There are obvious allusions to the mud paintings of Richard Long, and to landscape art the world over. But her medium has a political undercurrent: this earth comes from sites linked to the history of the transatlantic slave trade.Prabhakar Pachpute works on an enormous scale, his drawings starting on stretches of loose canvas and migrating across the gallery walls. Desolate landscapes peopled by machines and monsters, solitary heroes fighting unseen forces, a gigantic fist rising out of parched earth: his visions are dark and knotted, with overtones of Bosch, Brueghel and the stop-motion drawings of William Kentridge, especially in the reference to the depredations of coal and mineral mining in India.Pachpute uses charcoal, chalk and even coal, and his draughtsmanship has a terrific graphic force. The more you come across his works, the more you realise that they are accumulating into a new kind of Indian epic.The Japanese artist Meiro Koizumi (born 1976) is showing one of his most haunting works: a video triptych called Angels of Testimony, which centres on the devastating crimes perpetrated by Japanese soldiers upon the Chinese in the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-45). The central screen homes in on the face of a 99-year-old former soldier who can scarcely speak, attempting to remember his crimes. These emerge slowly, in a growing welter of tears.On either side of him, Japanese youths repeat his words in a kind of tragic chorus, some in a studio, others outdoors in the indifferent Tokyo streets.There is an obvious parallel with Weems’s Constructing History series, but here it is as though the horrors of history are disappearing out of reach; they cannot quite be remembered by the old, nor entirely grasped by the young. Koizumi is an immensely subtle dramatist of voice and image. You can get some sense of the sheer range of his theatrical projects from the artist’s own website. And likewise, until the galleries reopen, it is well worth visiting the rich, profound and intensely absorbing art of the biennial shortlist online.

Judas and the Black Messiah review – truly gripping Black Panther drama,Daniel Kaluuya and Lakeith Stanfield give award-worthy performances as party leader Fred Hampton and the man who betrayed him,4,"In the Oscar-tipped current release The United States vs Billie Holiday, a federal agent with deeply divided loyalties is dispatched to infiltrate and undermine a powerful voice of civil rights. That scenario is echoed in this superior “Inspired By True Events” drama from director and co-writer Shaka King, in which Lakeith Stanfield plays a petty car thief strong-armed into spying on prominent Black Panther leader Fred Hampton, charismatically portrayed by dead-cert Oscar contender Daniel Kaluuya.“A badge is scarier than a gun,” explains William O’Neal (Stanfield) when he’s arrested for impersonating an FBI agent to steal a flashy ride. “It’s like you got a whole damn army behind you.” Instead, he now has agent Roy Mitchell (Jesse Plemons) on his case, offering him a choice between several years in prison or becoming an informant. At the specific instruction of J Edgar Hoover (Martin Sheen, sporting Dracula-like makeup), the bureau has set its sights on Hampton, who is forging allegiances with a rainbow coalition of partners (“rednecks and Puerto Ricans!”) as the Panthers’ influence expands.With no avowed political beliefs beyond self-preservation, O’Neal seems the perfect tool to wrangle his way into the party and report on its inner workings. As he rises within the ranks, becoming security captain of the local Illinois chapter and bodyguard to Hampton, Hoover wants to use him “more creatively”. Yet O’Neal’s own affiliations are becoming ever more blurred, with his fears of being revealed as an informer intertwined with what appears to be a growing sympathy for Hampton’s revolutionary proclamations. As Mitchell observes after watching O’Neal at a fiery Panthers meeting: “Either this guy deserves an Academy Award or he believes this shit.”Just how much the real-life O’Neal bought into the Panthers’ rhetoric remains a matter of debate. Watching the full unedited footage of his 1989 interview for the PBS documentary Eyes on the Prize II (fragments of which are restaged) it’s clear that he liked and admired Hampton and felt both “bad” and “betrayed” by his role in his downfall. Yet he also looked up to Mitchell, whom he called a “role model”, and was enamoured of the FBI, which he viewed as entirely distinct from the vicious Chicago Police.It’s a credit to Stanfield that he manages to keep these complex contradictions alive throughout his performance, capturing perfectly the uneasy manner that O’Neal exhibited on camera, his eyes darting anxiously as he attempts to read his surroundings, his manner a mix of fearful, furtive and oddly forceful. By contrast, Kaluuya’s Hampton is steadfast and determined; inspirational in public, unexpectedly shy in person. Physically bulked up but often softly spoken, he’s a fully rounded character into whom Kaluuya injects empathy and a touch of magic. No wonder O’Neal is so taken with him, even when the Panthers’ Maoist teachings leave him cold. For all of Hampton’s incendiary speeches about killing “pigs” and dying for the revolution (Mitchell calls the Panthers and the Klan two sides of the same coin), it’s the free breakfasts for kids and healthcare programmes for the community that inspire the “poet” in Kaluuya’s character. There are echoes of the tenderness of If Beale Street Could Talk in the growing relationship between Fred and Deborah Johnson, played with guileless warmth by Bafta-nominee Dominique Fishback.Craig Harris and Mark Isham work in musical harmony with Sean Bobbitt’s gorgeous cinematography, providing suspicious melancholy chords, angular percussion and prowling double bass riffs that intertwine with the action. Meanwhile, Sam Lisenco, Jeremy Woolsey and Rebecca Brown ensure that the production design draws us deep into the period setting. It all adds up to a gripping drama that intersects fleetingly with that overpraised awards favourite The Trial of the Chicago 7 (in the sketched spectre of a bound Bobby Seale, the Black Panther co-founder), but feels altogether more substantial and satisfying.

Winner: Observer/Anthony Burgess prize for arts journalism 2021 – Harry Strawson on Mati Diop's In My Room,"This year’s winner enjoys Diop’s compelling lockdown film for Miu Miu, filmed entirely from her 24th-floor Paris apartment",0," Read the rest of this year’s shortlisted entries in the Observer/Anthony Burgess prizeIt can be said that lockdown has not been kind to fashion: last October the UK press reported that the country was facing a leisurewear shortage. When the French-Senegalese director and actor Mati Diop was approached early last year by the fashion house Miu Miu to make a short film for its Women’s Tales series, it posed a challenge. The brief for the series (which has run since 2011 and featured film-makers including Zoe Cassavettes, Chloë Sevigny and Lynne Ramsay) is straightforward enough: the film-makers must be women and can film whatever they choose, providing the film features Miu Miu clothing. The situation becomes more complicated during a pandemic: how exactly do you make a film – and one with fashion as a focus – amid the isolation, confinement and leisurewear of lockdown?In Diop’s 20-minute film In My Room, we are entirely confined to her small studio on the 24th floor of a tower block in Paris’s 13th arrondissement. The action, such as it is, takes place at the windows: Diop focuses her camera on her neighbours’ apartments and the sprawl of surrounding neighbourhoods. While the weather provides some drama (it rains, it shines, it thunders, the fog rolls in), we mostly see nothing much. It is compelling nonetheless, as Diop’s long-focus lens lingers intimately on a woman fussing over her curtains, or a man looking anxiously from cookbook to microwave. In one gloomy window, two silhouetted figures suddenly embrace and kiss passionately; in another, a man leans forward heavily and drags on a cigarette in the dark.It is not so much what we see, however, as what we hear that gives the film its power. “The only film I can imagine making now during confinement,” we watch Diop write in an email to Miu Miu, “is based on the recordings of my grandmother, Maji, that I registered a few months before she passed away. The recordings took place in … her Parisian apartment where she lived alone and confined for 20 years.” We hear, at first, the kind of stories we expect from an older relative as Maji talks about the war (“dead cats on the icy sidewalk”) and the consolation of film (“but there was cinema!”). The conversation turns to Maji’s soprano mother (Diop’s great-grandmother). “Did she sing La traviata?” asks Diop. “Bien sûr,” Maji responds. The prelude of La traviata begins to play and Maji’s voice slips hauntingly into the present. “Paris is the best city in the world for music and yet we can go nowhere. And we’re going to die. Isn’t that silly?”The casual (and very French) comment on mortality and absurdity delivered by Maji gives the film’s voyeuristic footage an uncomfortable poignancy – and this is nowhere more keenly felt than during the futile circuits we witness Diop and her neighbours make to and from the fridge. The first time Diop peers into the chill light she turns away empty-handed. One of her neighbours does exactly the same moments later. The next time Diop opens the fridge, she is wearing a pair of towering, incarnadine, high-heeled shoes: it is a witty and unexpected introduction of the Miu Miu clothes. We watch Diop crouch in front of the fridge in the scarlet heels and retrieve a bottle of wine and a Tupperware container. A corkscrew rattles off-camera: all dressed up and nowhere to go.The high-heeled raid on the fridge is one instance of the smart and sensitive way Diop incorporates fashion into her film: she makes the point that what people are wearing is just as significant as what they are not. When we see two sequined dresses blazing in the evening sun and hanging limply from a door, the empty and unworn clothes become a melancholy reminder of lives un-lived, postponed, diverted or cut short. “If … there had been no war,” Maji says at the beginning of the film, “I would have also tried to be an actress.”The final time we see Diop, she is wearing one of the dresses, and its diamantés flash like the night-time city lights on the other side of the window. The dress brings the outside inside: Diop throws her head back and lip-syncs to La traviata (it’s the bit where Violetta realises she loves Alfredo) and suddenly it doesn’t matter if Paris is the best city in the world for music (or, for that matter, fashion) and you can’t go out. It’s an irreverent and defiant scene, and captures the escapism dressing up can offer. But it only lasts a moment. The music stops abruptly and the film cuts to a curtain in the wind straining to get free as we hear Diop comforting a distressed Maji. “Come on,” she says in the film’s final words, “let’s go out.” Harry Strawson lives in London. His writing has appeared in the London Review of Books, Times Literary Supplement and Literary Review among others. He is news editor of Removals and Storage magazine"
Observer/Anthony Burgess prize for arts journalism 2021: Rachel Pronger on Promising Young Woman,In this runner-up entry Rachel Pronger reviews Emerald Fennell’s audacious feature debut Read the rest of this year’s shortlisted entries in the Observer/Anthony Burgess prize,0," Rachel Pronger writes about film, visual art and cultural history. She is also a programmer and curator, and cofounder of the feminist film collective Invisible Women. Born in Bradford, she is currently based in BerlinIt’s that queasy part of the night. We’re in a sleazy bar, the kind with mirrored walls and a sticky floor. A drunk woman sprawls on a banquette, propped up, barely able to lift her head. She’s smartly dressed, alone, abandoned. A group of men survey her with distaste. “They put themselves in danger, women like that. You’d think they’d learn by that age, right?”One of the men, a “Nice Guy”, comes to her rescue. He scoops her into a cab and takes her home. He puts her in his bed. She is semi-conscious. He begins to kiss her. She tells him to stop. He keeps going. She snaps awake. He gets the shock of his life.The opening scenes of Promising Young Woman are a bait-and-switch masterclass. The woman is Cassie (Carey Mulligan), and we’re joining her in the middle of a careful performance. By day, she’s a depressive deadbeat, living with her parents and wiling away time behind a coffeeshop counter. By night, she prowls bars in a tight dress, feigning intoxication, a honeytrap intent on catching predatory men in the act.Cassie’s vigilantism is fuelled by vengeance. Years ago, at med school, a traumatic incident shattered her promising future. Now a directionless dropout, Cassie’s righteous fury finds expression in night-time sprees. Isolated from her peers, her only contact is with kindly boss Gail (Laverne Cox) and her baffled parents (Jennifer Coolidge and Clancy Brown), who are unaware of how their once highflying daughter spends her nights. When a college acquaintance, the gentle Ryan (Bo Burnham), re-emerges, Cassie sees the opportunity to pursue revenge on a grander scale. At the same time, Ryan’s interest offers an escape from this double life and Cassie is caught between her desire for retribution and the possibility of love.The first feature from writer-director Emerald Fennell is a bold piece of work. Two of Fennell’s contrasting past credits – Camilla Parker-Bowles in The Crown and showrunner for Killing Eve – offer a curious primer. Genres are juggled with astonishing confidence, moods shift dramatically mid-scene. By turns a thriller, satire, dramady and romcom, Promising Young Woman is sliced through with violence, comedy and feminist commentary. Not every gear change works – like her mercurial antiheroine, Fennell’s approach can be as infuriating as it is impressive – but the fatalistic momentum is irresistible.Promising Young Woman is held together by its audacious sense of style. Cassie’s suburban daytime life is an Instagram paradise of powder blues, lilacs and yellows, her nocturnal hunting ground all dark oak and mirrorballs. Accents of pink (neon, millennial) and deep red (smudged lipstick, squelching pleather) streak through both worlds. The hyperreal aesthetic draws out Fennell’s Lynchian central theme: the seam of sleaze throbbing beneath our candy-coated everyday.For a certain demographic, there’s pleasure to be taken from Fennell’s skewering of millennial mores. Playful music choices – Paris Hilton, Spice Girls, Britney – are used to alternately hilarious and striking effect. The casting of Mulligan – on electrifying form after some time away from film – calls to mind her mid-00s breakthrough. Most enjoyably, Cassie’s victims are played by a rogue’s gallery of 00s stars, with the likes of Adam Brody (The OC) and Christopher Mintz-Plasse (Superbad) popping up in cameos. More than a gimmick, these memorable faces upend expectations. In Fennell’s world no one, not even a familiar face, can be trusted.While this millennial-baiting hits a demographic sweet spot, it also highlights a problem. Fennell uses near-past nostalgia to force her audience to look firmly to today, noting how conversations around rape culture, turbocharged by social media, have massively shifted in a decade. The trouble with addressing charged issues, though, is that the timeline of film-making inevitably struggles to keep pace with the conversation.Promising Young Woman is being sold as a #MeToo film. While a helpful aggregator, such labels don’t say much when you consider that the pantheon of #MeToo art runs the gamut from the pantomime simplicity of Bombshell to the thorny depths of I May Destroy You. Promising Young Woman is vastly superior to the former, but it’s hard not to compare its central discussion of consent with the latter, and find it wanting.The biggest question is that of timeliness. I first saw Promising Young Woman in March 2020, when it was slated for a spring release and surrounded by anticipatory buzz. Since then, obviously, a lot has happened. Displaced by cinema closures, it’s hard not to feel that its subversive edge has already been softened by the delay. It’s hard to know what landscape it will arrive in when the film is finally released next February. Nevertheless, while some freshness has been lost to the blackhole of pandemic time, this remains an undeniably auspicious debut – a cathartic, wild-eyed howl of a movie."
My English Cousin review – searching doc about a man between two worlds,This charming but opaque documentary about an Algerian migrant returning to his homeland doesn’t challenge its subject – or itself,3,"Algerian-Swiss film-maker Karim Sayad has here created a sweetly indulgent portrait of his “English cousin” Fahed: a pudgy, smiley, good-natured guy sloping about the place in his England shirt, someone whom you can easily imagine as a little boy. Twenty years ago, Fahed came to the UK from Algeria illegally and started out sleeping rough. Now, with a frustrating and burdensome existence in Grimsby working two jobs in a factory and a kebab shop and estranged from his English partner, he has a yearning to return to Algeria to be close to his mother. He even claims that there is an Algerian woman back home who wants to be his fiancee.Sayad follows Fahed back to the old country, where the prodigal son finds a warm but tense situation. Fahed’s mum and his aunt are affectionate but exasperated at Fahed’s evasiveness on the subject of this woman to whom he’s supposed to have proposed: he doesn’t sound excited to be getting married and we never actually see his intended. Will Fahed settle back down in Algeria? It’s doubtful, for the simple reason that the people that he really seems to like – he lights up in their company – are his mates back in Grimsby, the lads that he shares a house with and goes to the pub with.This is an opaque film; for all the directness of Sayad’s film-making style, there is an awful lot Fahed is keeping back from us. He won’t really open up to his mum or his aunt, and Sayad himself isn’t going to break cover and ask questions. The film leaves it up to us to decide whether or not Fahed’s decisions are the right ones. My English Cousin is released on 12 March on True Story."
How to Stop a Recurring Dream review – Ruby Barker lends class to kidnap thriller,"Compelling performances propel this family-at-war drama, but when the Bridgerton star bolts, plot implausibility creeps in",2,"There are some strong ideas and sharply observed family dysfunction drama in this feature debut by documentary maker Ed Morris. But none are enough to stop the film sinking into silliness, with a highly implausible abduction followed by a road trip across the South Downs.Bridgerton’s Ruby Barker plays troubled 19-year-old Yakira, who lives with her dad, his second wife and her lairy 12-year-old half-sister Kelly (Lily-Rose Aslandogdu). Family life is an emotional battlefield in their suburban semi, the two girls constantly at each other’s throats. Yakira resents the way their parents ignore Kelly’s nasty nickname for her: “No mum.” The whereabouts of her birth mother isn’t revealed until later on, but Barker’s compelling performance hints at a childhood trauma that has left Yakira feeling adrift in the world, vulnerable and impulsive.One night, after an explosive family row, Yakira kidnaps her sister while she sleeps. The logistics of this are the film’s first major plausibility lapse: is it actually possible to lift a 12-year-old out of bed, down some stairs and into a car without waking her up? Anyway, the plan is to take Kelly across the South Downs to visit Yakira’s mum. But when Kelly wakes up and flips, Yakira locks her in the boot. The police – called by their worried parents – launch a surprisingly well-resourced manhunt.Things go from bad to worse for Yakira when she accidentally picks up a hitchhiker (Andre Flynn). He looks like he’s walked out of a village hall production of Brideshead Revisited with a white suit, floppy hair and boarding-school sneer. Actually, he’s a drug dealer – and with his arrival the movie sinks into contrivance, increasingly forced and silly. Still, nothing can rub the shine off Barker’s huge talent; she is totally authentic even if the film is half-baked. How to Stop a Recurring Dream is released on 9 March on digital platforms. This article was amended on 12 March 2021. The actor who plays the hitchhiker is Andre Flynn, not Adam Hugill as an earlier version stated."
"Martyr review – masterful, visceral study of grief","A young man jumps into the sea in Mazen Khaled’s film, which takes an experimental and believable journey into anguish and loss",4,"Grief is a contradictory emotion: an intangible state of mind, while inducing overwhelming physical responses. Mazen Khaled’s masterly Martyr strikes the right balance as it simultaneously grounds the act of grieving in the real as well as the abstract.On a hot summer day in Beirut, Hassane (Hamza Mekdad) is restless. He lives with his parents who constantly nag him to get a job. Even his masturbation session in the shower is interrupted by his father grumbling about water waste. Dreaming of being submerged in the ocean, Hassane tries to find release at the seaside with his friends, equally aimless loafers who complain about stifling Beirut and their dire romantic prospects. Hassane, in a moment of bizarre clarity, climbs up above the rocky beach and takes a fatal dive. His body crashes into the water and suddenly, all that visible is sea-foam. Hassane doesn’t come up again.Like death, grief, too, is a kind of crash. Suddenly, Martyr erupts into freeze-frames. They capture Hassane’s body stretched out and gently carried by numerous pairs of arms and hands, as his friends bring him home. The moment death enters Hassane’s household, everyday life is irretrievably disrupted, and the film veers into experimentalism. At one point, Hassane’s mother (Carol Abboud) is seamlessly teleported to a black limbo where she and other female mourners grieve in the form of dance. In other hands, such stylistic choices might come off as gauche, but here they are cathartic; the mother’s devastating disbelief is violently exorcised.In Martyr, life and death are linked through such gestures. Moreover, while the sexual orientation of the men is unclear, there is a homoeroticism in their touch that nurtures Hassane from his adulthood to his sudden death. Grief can also be sensuous; that the same hands which have sunned with Hassane on the beach are now washing him for his final rites is pure cinematic poetry. Martyr is released on 12 March on digital platforms."
Fukushima 50 review – simmering tribute to power-plant heroes,There’s a touch of Hollywood in this dramatised account of the 50 workers who stayed at Fukushima Daiichi in an attempt to avert catastrophe,3,"Dangerously high concentrations of politeness are observed in this dramatisation of the 2011 disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Not only do most of the heroic “50” left behind to avert nuclear catastrophe constantly apologise for underperforming in acts of barely believable self-sacrifice, at one point a manager begs forgiveness for refusing to allow two employees to re-enter the radioactive zone after a failed first attempt. To the feckless western mind more likely to view Homer Simpson as the standard-issue nuclear power-plant employee, it’s a relief when – just for a second – a few Fukushima workers contemplate running away.It is possible director Setsurō Wakamatsu has taken the Hollywood route in portraying the staff as so infallibly courageous – though Fukushima 50 is adapted from journalist Ryusho Kadota’s book, which investigated the response to the earthquake and tsunami in more than 90 interviews. Possibly to avoid lawsuits from Tokyo Electric Power Company executives portrayed here as selfish and shamefully caught on a back foot, everyone in the film is fictionalised – except for prime minister Naoto Kan, though he is never referred to by name, and plant manager Masao Yoshida. Yoshida crucially defies orders and allows the reactors to be cooled with seawater – which prevented meltdown and the possible devastation of Japan’s entire eastern seaboard. The reactors also must be “vented” for pressure manually by workers agonisingly selected for the task. Played by Ken Watanabe as a man having the ultimate bad day at work, the simmering Yoshida looks in need of a similar intervention.Wakamatsu treats his account of these critical hours – the first direct depiction of the disaster, though Sion Sono’s Himizu (2011) was a poetic first responder – like a machine to be kept running at all costs. Often it consists of little more than technicians pelting into crisis rooms, adhering to the Akira school of screaming, with shocking gas-pressure read-outs. The civilian backstories are token, and though the film is critical of the brass, it doesn’t let this anger break into climactic outrage. Yoshida died in 2013 of unrelated oesophageal cancer: Watanabe’s big-shouldered presence makes this an ample tribute to the man, but the film could have been more than an easy clap for his workers. Fukushima 50 is available from 8 March on digital formats."
Into the Darkness review – a Danish family at war as the Nazis roll in,"In Anders Refn’s sweeping second world war saga, a wealthy clan is ripped apart after choosing several different sides in the conflict",3,"Veteran film-maker Anders Refn has had top-billing as a director on a few films that aren’t terribly well known beyond his native Denmark. His reputation is mostly built on his long service as an editor with a very impressive filmography, having cut such films as Breaking the Waves and Antichrist for Lars Von Trier, as well as Sally Potter’s Ginger & Rosa. He also happens to be the father of a more famous film-maker, the flamboyantly talented Nicolas Winding Refn (The Neon Demon, Drive). But judging by Into the Darkness, a historical drama directed and co-written by the elder Refn, father and son couldn’t have more different sensibilities.Not that this second world war-set family saga is at all bad; it’s just very conventional, and feels like it might have been originally conceived as a multi-part drama for television. At its best, the film’s soapy immersion in local history recalls the German epic TV show Heimat. At its worst, it’s a little dry and thumpingly didactic as the various members of the haut-bourgeois Skov family experience the consequences of their moral choices played out as war rages on, even in their relatively quiet corner of occupied Denmark.Patriarch Karl (the great Jesper Christensen) runs a factory that is doing well enough to keep his alcoholic wife, Eva (Bodil Jørgensen), in pretty frocks and nice tableware while their numerous children have pretty much everything they want. But once the Nazis roll into town, the family is fractured along ideological lines, making for some very awkward Christmas Eves. Ne’er-do-well eldest Aksel (Mads Reuther) finds himself more sympathetic to anti-Nazi leftists: at first because of his friendship with the housekeeper’s son (Cyron Melville) and later because he fancies a pretty Bolshevik (Kathrine Thorborg Johansen). Meanwhile, another son (Gustav Dyekjær Giese) joins the Danish army and fights side by side with the Germans, and naive daughter Helene (Sara Viktoria Bjerregaard) is smitten with a dashing German U-boat officer, much to the disgust of her mother. Assorted Jewish friends are carted off and killed, leaving various members of the family questioning their choices.If you have 152 minutes to sink into this morass of moral complexity and finely observed period detail, then it may well be worth it, although the ending is bizarrely, perplexingly abrupt. Perhaps there will be a follow-up feature. Into the Darkness is released on 5 March on digital platforms."
Boss Level review – macho time loop action caper repeats same old formula,Frank Grillo lives the same day again and again and again in a video game-adjacent thriller that struggles to distinguish itself,2,"As repetitive as the time loop movie might have been in the last 12 months (just like the 12 months before and the 12 months before that etc), it’s not been quite as omnipresent, or as tiresome, as the running joke that we’re all essentially stuck in one of our own thanks to the restricted routine that’s been forced on us all. But even a year ago, Boss Level, Joe Carnahan’s action movie spin on the Groundhog Day formula, would have smelled a little musty, and not just because it was developed back in 2012 and filmed back in 2018, left on a shelf ever since.It’s now landing with a thud on Hulu, not long after the streamer premiered the time loop romantic comedy Palm Springs, which arrived six months before Amazon’s time loop teen romantic comedy The Map of Tiny Perfect Things, which arrived a few weeks before not only this time loop action thriller but also time loop home invasion horror Lucky, out this week too. It’s a headache that, when taking into account the last four years of two Happy Death Day movies, a season of Russian Doll, the YA drama Before I Fall and the Netflix comedy Naked, quickly turns into a migraine. A rarely used narrative technique has become an overstuffed sub-genre all of its own and while it still can work (last month’s The Map of Tiny Perfect Things was a sweet surprise), too often writers rely on the gimmick of it to sell an otherwise under-par story. Without it, Boss Level would just be another poor man’s John Wick or a bankrupt man’s Taken, a story of a guy in his 50s killing a lot of people for a woman in his life, a story we’ve been offered on a loop for quite some time.The guy is Ray (Frank Grillo), who wakes up to the same nightmare every day: everyone wants him dead. He doesn’t know why and he doesn’t know why he’s stuck here but he’s become awfully good at knowing exactly how to avoid every bullet, knife, sword and helicopter that comes his way. Like a character in a video game (which he’s not but he might as well be, even referring to this fact himself), he needs to try to get further with each day to see what’s really going on although chances are it has something to do with the mysterious tech project his ex Jemma (Naomi Watts) is working on with her evil boss, the Colonel (Mel Gibson). Ray must keep getting killed until he can find a way to live.Carnahan, whose work has always focused on bullets, bombs and blokes (his grim, surprisingly poignant survival thriller The Grey still an underrated highpoint), stays comfortably within his wheelhouse here, yet in a way that borders on laziness, a strange flatness hampering the film, despite its energetic pace. It’s curiously un-stylish, despite every indicator trying to convince you otherwise from its soft-boiled noir voiceover (which gets tiresome real fast) to the motley assemblage of quirk-drenched assassins on Ray’s tail. The dialogue is often embarrassingly desperate to be quoted yet the one-liners range from hoary to heinous (“Shit’s about to get steel,” a character says before she uses her sword ) and Carnahan’s knowing nods (a reference to Taken, a sequence at a video game convention) feel smug rather than smart, as if he knows how pointless the whole thing is yet insists you pay attention anyway (for a film that’s modelled and named after a video game, it also appears to be strangely loathing of gamers).When this flimsiness then hardens in the last act, when we’re expected to suddenly care about Ray, his family and whether the world might end (!), the film’s earlier simple pleasures (some inventive action, some effective gore) are lost in a sea of self-seriousness. Grillo is an accomplished physical performer and effortlessly sells every single beat of his many action sequences but sadly doesn’t quite have the magnetic charisma of a leading man, most apparent when sharing the screen with an underserved Watts and an underused Michelle Yeoh (even Gibson, vile bigotry notwithstanding, has enough presence to blast him off the screen). A key problem with Grillo’s character is that he enters the time loop as an already expertly trained ex-special forces officer, so there’s not much satisfaction in seeing him go from skilled to even more skilled. One of the many pleasures of Doug Liman’s thrilling time loop sci-fi adventure Edge of Tomorrow was seeing Tom Cruise thrust into combat with no experience, watching him slowly improve, a progression we’re denied here, unmooring us from the chaos that unfolds.As the umpteenth time loop movie we’ve seen of late, Boss Level never offers a convincing enough argument for the gimmick to be leaned on yet again, a mishmash of better movies blended into something a little bland. When in the last act, Watts’s scientist remarks that “this whole thing is so cobbled together”, one can’t help but agree.Boss Level is released on Hulu on 5 March"
Petite Maman review – Céline Sciamma's spellbinding ghost story,"A girl meets her mother as a child in the woods in a moving jewel of a film about memory, friendship and kin",5,"Céline Sciamma’s beautiful fairytale reverie is occasioned by the dual mysteries of memory and the future: simple, elegant and very moving. I fell instantly under its spell, and found myself thinking of classic English tales such as Tom’s Midnight Garden by Philippa Pearce, or The Child in Time by Ian McEwan. And there is an extra-textual pleasure in wondering exactly what its child stars thought about it during filming – and what they think about it now.Joséphine Sanz plays Nelly, the eight-year-old daughter of Marion (Nina Meurisse). The latter is under enormous stress. Marion’s mother has just died in a care home, from long-term complications of a hereditary bone disorder, which Marion herself had to avoid with a painful operation when she was about Nelly’s age. Young Nelly artlessly asks her mum if she can keep her grandmother’s cane, and Marion blankly agrees. Then Marion and her partner (Stéphane Varupenne) take Nelly on a difficult journey to her late mother’s home, where she grew up, and the memories come flooding back – particularly that of a secret hut she built in the woods adjoining the house. Marion is overwhelmed with grief and leaves Nelly alone with her dad. Nelly, being an only child, like her mum, is used to solitude. Her mother’s absence, whether physical or emotional, is something she has had to deal with all her life.Playing in the woods she comes across what appears to be a half-finished hut in a clearing. A girl waves happily to her, asking for help making it. She is the mirror image of Nelly (played by Gabrielle Sanz, evidently Joséphine’s twin sister) and announces that her name is … Marion. After playing together, they go back to Marion’s house, which appears to be an eerie mirror-image of her Nelly’s mother’s childhood home. And there Nelly meets Marion’s kindly, withdrawn, thirtysomething mum, who walks painfully with a cane.It is a ghost story, or a parable, played with realist calm. The girls talk about the future and the past as casually as they would talk about anything else. I found myself holding my breath for long stretches, as the young stars insouciantly saunter in single file along the narrative tightrope. They are left alone on screen for long periods of time, just playing and talking together.“Secrets aren’t always things we try to hide,” says Nelly to her new best friend. “There’s just no one to tell them to.” Their secret is confided to us: the audience. Perhaps Nelly’s mum was as lonely as a child as Nelly is now. Perhaps Nelly has always wanted her mum to be a friend, to speak to her as directly and simply as she would a friend her own age. And perhaps the adult Marion has felt exactly the same thing.I’m not being facetious when I say that this meeting of the two girls reminded me of Marty McFly’s first encounter with his dad in Back to the Future, another brilliant film of a very different type. There is something eternally strange about the simple fact that your parents were once the same age as you, had the same worries and fears and thoughts as you; and crucially, the same inability to see into the future – the future which is you. Making these two characters vulnerable and delicate children is an artistic masterstroke on Sciamma’s part. What a superb movie – a jewel of this year’s Berlin film festival. Petite Maman screened at the Berlin film festival and is released on 19 November in the UK."
I Don't Feel at Home in This World Anymore: not the indie drama you're expecting,Macon Blair’s directorial debut sends Melanie Lynskey and Elijah Wood abruptly thundering down a neo-noir path,0," I Don’t Feel At Home in This World Anymore is available to stream in Australia on Netflix. For more recommendations of what to stream in Australia, click hereRuth (Melanie Lynskey) is frustrated by the selfish and inconsiderate actions of other people. From exhaust-belching SUVs, to rude supermarket patrons, to the generally ill-mannered. She is bothered by things that in isolation might seem slight, perhaps even inconsequential, but they slowly congeal, amassing into a huge, morale-sapping void. With no single point of focus at which to direct her anger, the only possible route for Ruth’s frustration is for it to sit and simmer, until such a point as something causes it to boil over.That boiling point comes when Ruth’s house is robbed. Her laptop and grandmother’s silverware is stolen and the police action on the matter is limited to the creation of a case number and the suggestion Ruth herself is at fault. Even when presented with an avenue for investigation, the law is hamstrung by its own listless investigative process. Ruth is made acutely aware she is the only one who cares.So begins I Don’t Feel At Home In This World Anymore, a dark comedy that won the Grand Jury prize for drama at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival, before dropping on Netflix a month later. It combines a good old-fashioned detective story with feelings of modern helplessness, escalating everyday irritation and existential despair. But, you know, it’s also funny.The robbery is the final straw in Ruth’s disenfranchisement. She is left with no option but to solve the crime herself. In order to do so, she befriends her oddball neighbour Tony (Elijah Wood), who spends his days listening to British heavy metal and obsessing over Japanese martial arts. Tony is a bit of an outsider himself, but not remotely as obnoxious as he self-describes.Armed only with a GPS tracking device, a plaster cast of a footprint and some ninja stars, they set out to retrieve Ruth’s property. Unfortunately it sets them on a collision course with a trio of violent criminals, including the seedy gang leader Marshall, played by David Yow of noise rock maniacs The Jesus Lizard.Writer and director Macon Blair (the actor in his directorial debut) skilfully draws the viewer into Ruth’s life, lulling us into thinking we’re watching a Duplass Brothers-style indie drama, before it thunders suddenly down a neo-noir path, containing righteous lawn ornament theft and a lot of casual violence.Just in case that sounds like I Don’t Feel At Home is a bit miserable, let me assure you there is plenty of gallows humour to be found in the absurd and sudden tonal shift that takes place halfway through the narrative. More broadly comic is Ruth’s daily grind and Tony’s self-importance; Lynskey and Wood share a great chemistry and make for a hugely agreeable detective duo.Ruth’s earnest wish “for people not to be assholes” is met with scorn and mocking. So there are also vicarious thrills to be had when she turns a resigned defeat into a compelling and grisly adventure. I haven’t quite decided if emerging from lockdown has made these small irritations more significant or not, but if the film-makers ever made a sequel I’m sure they could add anti-maskers, vaccine conspiracy theorists and toilet paper hoarders to Ruth’s list of grievances.Since it’s Ruth’s alienation that makes her so sympathetic as a character, I Don’t Feel At Home In This World Anymore becomes somewhat ironic as a title. Nevertheless, the salient point is that this is a truly outstanding crime thriller and one of the best film offerings on Netflix today."
The United States vs Billie Holiday review – Andra Day's film all the way,"As the blues singer, Day is magnetic in Lee Daniels’s often chaotic biopic, built around a speculative romance between Holiday and a government agent",3,"“It was called ‘the United States of America versus Billie Holiday,’” wrote the jazz legend in her 1956 autobiography, “and that’s just the way it felt.” Holiday’s 1947 conviction, when she was sentenced to a year and a day for possession of narcotics, was just one chapter in a sustained campaign against the singer, whose performances of Abel Meeropol’s anguished, anti-lynching ballad Strange Fruit had become a lightning rod for civil rights awareness and activism.Holiday’s steadfast refusal to stop singing that song was perhaps the greatest indication of her indomitable spirit, forged in the fires of a tough-as-nails upbringing that saw her survive horrific childhood abuse to become a superstar in an age of often deadly racial and sexual prejudice. Yet in Precious director Lee Daniels’s timely but muddled biopic, which boasts a revelatory performance by Andra Day, the authorities’ harassment of Holiday is given a perverse romantic twist in the shape of a federal agent ordered to spy on the star.Trevante Rhodes, who proved such a mesmerising presence in Barry Jenkins’s Moonlight, is Jimmy Fletcher, the handsome undercover narc assigned to infiltrate Holiday’s inner circle, gathering evidence of her drug use. Yet even when Jimmy’s occupation is revealed, the singer and her entourage continue to tolerate his presence. Indeed, Jimmy’s sympathetic attentions are starkly juxtaposed with Holiday’s otherwise abusive relationships with men – the partners, husbands and managers who often seem more like pimps. Fletcher may have been instructed by racist war on drugs chief Harry Anslinger (Garrett Hedlund) to take Billie down, but he finds himself sharing both her confidence and her bed, even shooting up heroin with her to prove his allegiance.The speculative relationship at the heart of Pulitzer-winning playwright/novelist Suzan-Lori Parks’s script appears to be rooted in a passing claim by Johann Hari (author of the film’s credited source book Chasing the Scream) that “the man Anslinger sent to track and bust Billie Holiday had, it seems, fallen in love with her”. Certainly Fletcher was on record as feeling conflicted about his role in Holiday’s legal travails, and she later wrote to him, saying: “Most federal agents are nice people … Maybe they would have been kinder to me if they had been nasty; then I wouldn’t have trusted them enough to believe what they told me.” Yet foregrounding this presumed romance seems bizarre when the verifiable details of Holiday’s life are so compelling, particularly since the spectre of a singer being silenced for performing a quietly incendiary song clearly has drama to spare.Like Sidney J Furie’s uneven 1972 biopic Lady Sings the Blues, for which Diana Ross received a deserved best actress Oscar nomination, Daniels’s problematic movie – which careens wildly between stagey interviews, hallucinatory horrors and audacious musical set pieces – rests squarely upon the shoulders of a singer turned actor who breathes cinematic life into a musical icon. Day really is a dazzling screen presence, capturing the poise and raw power of her subject, whether performing on stage with an orchid in her hair and bandages around her bruised ribs, or delivering a slap between numbers in a heady whirlwind of world tour highs and lows. As James Erskine’s recent documentary Billie demonstrated, Holiday transcended the trite label of “victim”, and Day invests her performance with a vibrant strength that cannot be quelled, even in the most appalling circumstances.Top-notch production design by Daniel T Dorrance (aided by a monochrome-to-colour editing device reminiscent of The Night They Raided Minsky’s), eye-catching costume work by Paolo Nieddu and handsome cinematography by Andrew Dunn (whose credits include Daniels’s Precious and The Butler) lend a glossy sheen to the often chaotic proceedings. But this is Day’s show all the way, and her performance remains the film’s strongest suit. On Sky Cinema"
Streaming: enjoy a feast of new films at Glasgow film festival 2021,This year’s virtual edition of an often overlooked festival is streaming an exceptional lineup of acclaimed movies yet to be seen in the UK,0,"While cinemas and their release calendars continue to hover uncertainly in the pandemic confusion, film festivals are adapting impressively to the home-viewing model. On the heels of Sundance’s successful virtual edition, the Berlinale begins its own next week. Closer to home, meanwhile, the hitherto low-key Glasgow film festival has, in going online, seized the opportunity to become a national cinema event.Usually outdone in publicity terms by the London and Edinburgh film festivals, Glasgow’s programmers have this year assembled a lineup that, at a time when nobody knows exactly what new films are coming out when, feels like a genuine treasure chest. In many cases, it offers British audiences their first glimpse of critically beloved films that may not be available on general release for several months yet.The festival kicked off on Wednesday with the UK premiere of Lee Isaac Chung’s stirring, Oscar-tipped Korean-American immigrant saga Minari. The festival’s programming system means that each film has a 72-hour online viewing window, for which you have to book access at £9.99 per film. Minari’s screening period ends at 7pm today, but it will be released in the UK and Ireland on 19 March (see altitude.film for details). The good news is that the festival runs for another week, with plenty of treats yet to come.This weekend, for example, you can watch Apples, an oddly timely entry in the so-called Greek “weird wave” genre, from first-time director Christos Nikou. Set in the midst of a global pandemic that causes mass amnesia, it follows one man’s journey through a bizarre recovery programme designed to forge new identities for the forgotten. The deadpan, absurdist influence of Yorgos Lanthimos is clear, but Nikou’s film has its own bittersweet poignancy.Another highlight of this weekend’s selection is Poly Styrene: I Am a Cliche, a zesty documentary portrait of the British punk frontwoman, bathed in the kind of palpable personal investment you’d expect from a film directed by the subject’s daughter, Celeste Bell. If your music-doc tastes veer more mainstream, wait until Friday for Tina, in which rock-soul goddess Tina Turner gets the celebratory, all-encompassing biographical treatment from Oscar-winning film-makers Daniel Lindsay and TJ Martin.Some of the standouts in the programme have already been duly lauded abroad. From Friday, UK audiences can at last see Kelly Reichardt’s exquisite First Cow, the best new film I saw in 2020. An elegiac, warmly lived-in fable of pioneer capitalism, it got a US release last spring, but here was left in distribution limbo for too long. (Mubi will now give it a full-scale release in May.) Frederick Wiseman’s vast documentary City Hall, a granular, Boston-set study of Democratic sleeves-rolled-up politics in action, is among the recent festival favourites available next week. Ditto Victor Kossakovsky’s Gunda, a captivating, wordless documentary portrait of a farmyard sow that plays like Babe by way of Bresson; and British newcomer Ben Sharrock’s Limbo, a clever, cockeyed comedy on the unlikely subject of refugee survival on a Scottish island.But a few other exceptional picks have enjoyed less of the spotlight in advance, and deserve your attention. Hungarian director Lili Horvát’s Preparations to Be Together for an Unknown Period of Time is a noir-tinged psychodrama as alluringly strange and untidy as its title, following a brain surgeon caught up in a romantic fixation that may or may not be wholly imagined. And French coming-of-age drama Gagarine is a pure delight; this story of a star-gazing teen fighting to save his Paris housing project home from demolition would have been likely to become a word-of-mouth sensation if it had debuted, as planned, at Cannes last year. Perhaps we can start the chatter now.The Glasgow film festival runs until 8 March. Book tickets hereCapone (Netflix, 18) This lurid, grisly biopic of Chicago crime lord Al Capone earned something of a reputation as a film maudit last year, not helped by the already battered Hollywood reputation of its director, Josh Trank, and slipped quietly on to Netflix in the UK last week. It’s less generic than you might expect: Tom Hardy’s electric, eccentric performance strips the underworld icon of his swagger and leaves an incontinent, syphilitic shell. There are parallels with Scorsese’s The Irishman, though this is very much the B-movie version.White Riot (Modern Films, 15) Rubika Shah’s lean, purposeful documentary charts the rise of the Rock Against Racism movement in mid-70s Britain. While it’s a useful roundup of all the names and faces that inspired and sustained this wave of popular activism, it’s also effective simply as an evocation of how splintered and hostile Britain was to its own diversity: a snapshot that, in the age of Black Lives Matter, doesn’t feel that far away.The Last Vermeer (Sony, 15) The recovery and redistribution of Nazi-stolen artworks is the basis for this old-fashioned, absorbing postwar mystery, as a former Resistance fighter (Claes Bang) investigates a louche art forger (Guy Pearce) accused of collaborating with the Nazis. The film has a slight Europudding whiff about it, but the cast – also including Vicky Krieps – keep it lively."
Billie Eilish: The World's a Little Blurry review – a fascinating look at an artist and idol,RJ Cutler’s two-hour-plus Apple documentary on the pop phenom reveals an exceptional artist grappling with both superstar fame and lame parent jokes,4,"By age 19, the singer Billie Eilish has reached heights of fame and success that feel both otherworldly and familiar, carried by the same tides of generational mega-popularity that have buoyed such teen music idols as Britney Spears and Miley Cyrus before her, but with a Gen Z twist. It’s Eilish publicity canon that the then-15-year-old rocketed to social media fame after her older brother and co-producer, Finneas, posted a song they recorded for her dance class, Ocean Eyes, to Soundcloud, that they recorded her smash debut album, When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? in his childhood bedroom, that the two MacGyver everyday sounds – a dentist’s drill, the slurp of Eilish’s Invisalign retainer – into songs that garner billions of streams.These are not myths; as captured in RJ Cutler’s mesmerizing and generous Apple TV+ documentary The World’s a Little Blurry, Eilish did, indeed, spend these supersonic teenage years at her family’s modest house in Los Angeles; she and Finneas do compose their music in his bedroom with such organic sibling telepathy it seems almost too casual to be the omnipresent dark-pop hits Bad Guy or Bury a Friend. But over the course of nearly two and a half hours, The World’s a Little Blurry offers a fascinating rejoinder to any cynicism that this could be image maintenance for a teenage superstar. The verité-style documentary, filmed from late 2018 through Eilish’s Grammys sweep in 2020 (11 awards, including album of the year), observes an enviably talented and more enviably self-possessed young woman handling the twin rocketships of superstardom and adolescence with astounding awareness, if not always control.The trust afforded to Cutler (The War Room, The September Issue) by Eilish’s family – mom Maggie Baird and father Patrick O’Connell, both near-constant presences – is evident. The camera roves through the family home, dropping in on family arguments (Maggie and Finneas, and then Eilish, arguing over the latter’s reluctance to make an “accessible” hit) and Eilish’s bedroom the morning of her Grammy nominations. The film glides on the always-magnetic juxtaposition of superstardom weirdness with relatability – Eilish DM-ing her idol, Justin Bieber, posting to her millions of Instagram followers, selecting her signature baggy couture outfits for tour; Eilish studying for her driver’s permit, complaining about her family’s lame cars, or groaning when her father compares new music to a Duncan Sheik song.It also includes all the promises of authenticity we’ve come to expect from modern music documentaries: quiet moments, the stress of touring, the vertigo of rapid-onset fame, work process competency porn. But whereas Taylor Swift’s Miss Americana, released last year on Netflix, often felt like a meticulous, if entertaining, propaganda project, The World’s a Little Blurry portrays an artist for whom the idea of “authenticity” is both artistically important and for filming, passé.Eilish was born in 2001 and grew up accustomed to documentation, by family and oneself; as she told Colbert this week, “I don’t really change in front of a camera.” Part of the hook of The World’s a Little Blurry’s is to watch a star who understands, as do her fans who grew up on Snapchat and Instagram, that to be on camera is to be both yourself and not – the calibration is so fluid, and so ubiquitous, as to be nearly indistinguishable, or maybe more accurately, irrelevant, to “real” life.Thus Cutler’s film feels like watching Eilish be Eilish, even as she mugs to the camera in the style of her favorite show, The Office. The film has its fair share of intimate moments: a tic-attack from her Tourette’s, a forlorn phone call with a distant, inattentive (now-ex) boyfriend she has not previously discussed with the public, quiet backstage disappointment with what she considers to be a subpar Coachella performance (“You forgot some words to a new song, big deal, who cares?” O’Connell, consistently the most dad of dads, supplies).Its strongest element, aside from Eilish herself, is the generosity and empathy afforded to the experience of fandom. Eilish, so devoted to Bieber as a 12-year-old that Baird considered putting her in therapy, speaks fluently of the hyper-intense adoration lobbed at her by millions, predominantly teenage girls. When she breaks down for a full 30 seconds upon meeting him, in one of The World’s a Little Blurry’s best scenes, it may as well be any one of the crying, alight faces in her crowds. The chasmic emotion, the consuming devotion for your artistic heroes, the way it makes even the darkest recesses of your brain feel temporarily OK – that, for Eilish, her fans, and viewers, is strikingly real.Billie Eilish: The World’s a Little Blurry is available on Apple TV+ from 26 February"
"Hellraiser: Judgment review – diminishing, misogynist returns for classic franchise","Pinhead is still lurking, but the iconic series’ once-interesting eroticism has degenerated into nasty titillation in this sorry sequel ",1,"There have been so many additions to the Hellraiser franchise since the first one debuted in 1987 that we’ve now got to the stage when it’s best not to remind viewers how many there have been, lest the young uns think it’s some kind of musty Gen X thing that just won’t die. Which it kind of is, to be honest. This latest contribution, written and directed by makeup effects specialist Gary J Tunnicliffe, feels like a pretty degraded mutation from the original concept. Where the first few Hellraisers had an interesting if somewhat icky erotic tang to them – alluding to S&M/fetish culture as much as horror, and featuring female protagonists – Judgment is less about desire than just straight-up misogyny and gory, gross-out money shots.The franchise’s iconic demon Pinhead is back once again (of course), played here by Paul T Taylor. But he’s more of a background presence as an assortment of other demons, including one played by Tunnicliffe himself, take over the business of bedevilling humanity via what sounds like insurance industry-based methods of torture, given they call themselves The Auditor, The Assessor and whatnot. Among the living, the main characters are a trio of cops – two of them brothers Sean (Damon Carney) and David Carter (Randy Wayne), as well as rookie Christine (Alexandra Harris) – who are investigating what seems to be a serial killer case. One of the first victims is a young woman (Grace Montie) who dares to be sexually active, and ends up with her lapdog and mobile phone sewn up inside her body.Elsewhere, there’s a trio of supernatural vamps who sit in judgment over souls and have fake blood hosed on to their large naked breasts, which I guess is one way to get your jollies. The dialogue is execrable, which partly excuses the inert performances; the sets – including one that looks like a shop’s filament bulb display – are more interesting to look at than the actors. Released on 22 February on digital platforms."
Zappa review – under the skin of the wild man of American rock,Alex Winter weaves the early experiences of eccentric musician Frank Zappa into a portrait of the artist as a flawed man,4,"This documentary about the hugely prolific Frank Zappa, directed by Alex “Bill Preston Esq” Winter, takes an unusually serious-minded approach to the celebrated wild man of 1960s and 70s American rock: ranging from his unusual childhood, to his ferocious work ethic, to his political-sphere interventions, this is a fruitful attempt to get under the skin of a figure who is renowned for lurking eccentrically at the music industry’s periphery. One thing it doesn’t focus much on is the music itself; perhaps the ongoing devotion of Zappa’s hardcore fans means there’s no compelling reason to introduce the work to a new generation.In Winter’s eyes, Zappa’s oddness was set early: the son of a chemical engineer who worked for an army poison gas lab, his musical interests were sparked by an album of experimental percussion by modernist composer Edgar Varèse (the exact quote: “the most frightening, evil, vile thing a human being could listen to; I couldn’t understand why people didn’t love it”); an early encounter with the law, which saw him ejected from the small-town studio he set up as a young man for supposedly agreeing to help make a “stag film”, set him on the way to embracing the counterculture in Los Angeles and later New York.The film is at pains to counter some of the more enduring Zappa myths: he was not some whacked-out hippy, avoided drugs, and worked with a focused dedication to realise his musical vision. The cost of this is spelled out: many of the musicians found him a distant presence, ready to ditch them once their purpose was served; his children had to pitch for his attention; and his wife Gail, who speaks here at length before her death in 2015, had to contend with Zappa’s well-known fondness for the groupie lifestyle and – to put it mildly – some unreconstructed views on women. Winter also devotes lengthy sequences to Zappa’s congressional testimony in opposition to labelling record lyrics, and his unlikely adoption as a cultural envoy by post-cold war Czechoslovakia.There’s perhaps a little too much telling us what a genius Zappa was without really letting us hear for ourselves; this perhaps also explains the stress laid on his “classical” compositions, as if to reinforce his serious-musician credentials. But there’s no denying Zappa’s personal charisma and devotion to his cause, nor his articulacy in its service. Winter has created a fascinating watch. Available at Altitude.Film."
Allen v Farrow review – effective docuseries on allegations of abuse,The sexual abuse allegations leveled at Woody Allen are put under the spotlight with exhaustive research in a damning if bloated series,3,"Woody Allen will not be ignored. After decades of controversy engulfing his personal life, it would have been easy enough for him to retire and enjoy what must surely be a lot of money, or to just continue working in volitive obscurity, making his ever-worsening movies in Europe for a rapidly shrinking audience. But as viewers of HBO’s new miniseries Allen v Farrow will amply learn, a refusal to back down forms a key part of the pathology animating the man referred to by the mononym of “Woody”.From a New York magazine interview alongside his wife, Soon-Yi Previn, in 2018 to a mud-slinging memoir last year, he is still doing press and insisting that he is innocent of the claims of sexual abuse levied against him by Mia Farrow’s daughter Dylan. The four-part documentary from Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering represents an equal and opposite effort, as Dylan herself and those in her corner meet Woody’s unbudging denials – he has forcefully denied the allegations – with their own steadfast determination. Starting with the title, the series portrays this long-and-deep-running acrimony as a domestic war between two feuding camps. It decisively takes a side, too, but only once a comprehensive presentation of the information has made that much appear to be the lone reasonable option. Coupled with affecting testimonials from Mia and Dylan, telling her story with an immediacy inaccessible to her accounts in the printed word, the reportage does everything short of actually proving guilt. Dick and Ziering leave the matter a he-said-she-said, and methodically show that what he is saying is unconvincing, while what she is saying seems too well-founded (and shattering) to be doubted.Spanning nearly 40 years and spun around an intricate family tree, this complicated case requires a lot of untangling. To that end, the series is almost diligent to a fault, repeatedly reiterating the same points and analyses already known to anyone with even a passing familiarity. Like so many true-crime nonfiction cinema projects these days – the clear mold from which this approach has been cast – it seems to bulk up its own length for length’s sake, topping out at over four hours. Though more palatable when doled out over a month’s broadcasting, viewing the screeners in a single binge underscores just how much of that time gets eaten up by restatement and rephrasing.But Ziering and Dick, along with a stable of interview subjects ranging from tertiary characters in the Farrow orbit to film critics contextualizing Woody’s life and works, do convey the key information authoritatively and emphatically. Mia and Woody linked up around 1980, and while he took a shine straight away to her adopted son Moses (a glaring absence in the series, like Woody himself and Soon-Yi, cast here as a coordinated opposition), he would cultivate a more fraught relationship to young Dylan, adopted by the couple in 1985. As an adult, she recounts him allegedly smashing her face into a plate of spaghetti and other enraged outbursts, an enmity which culminated in her allegation at age seven that she had been sexually violated by her father. Woody countered that the girl had been coached into a false confession by Mia, furious with him upon her then-recent discovery that he had been conducting an affair with the college-aged Soon-Yi.One of the miniseries’ primary objectives is to expose the apparent lapses in the justice system that exonerated Woody in the 90s, even as his reputation now sinks deeper into the toilet with each passing year. He filed for custody of Moses, Ronan, and Dylan in 1992 to get Mia on the defensive, a trial that would unduly come to stand as a referendum on his innocence. Ziering and Dick question the results that shot down both his custody bid and the accusations of sexual abuse, drawing attention to a Connecticut district attorney lacking in zeal and pivotal psych evaluations since discredited. Woody’s legal team did everything in its power to cast Mia as a vindictive manipulator and Dylan as the impressionable child in her thrall, but the mainstream embrace of feminism clarifies that those attacks were largely rooted in misogynistic notions of hysterical, untrustworthy women.In an effort to touch on everything, some sub-topics (separating the art from the artist for Woody fans, the scuttled release of his latest film A Rainy Day in New York) get addressed so glancingly, they’d be best omitted. But however overinflated, the series has a lucid sense of its central image: that of a family ripped in half, with the kids left to choose sides. Like them, all the public can do is believe one set of premises or the other. Did a man famed for his well-documented, self-confessed attraction to teenage girls cross a line with his daughter, or did the Farrows, one of whom has a name synonymous with defense for abused women, concoct and spend their whole lives defending a conspiracy as a spiteful response to a sexual indiscretion from nearly 30 years ago? Dick and Ziering’s presentation hones Occam’s razor to a point sharp enough to draw blood.Allen v Farrow begins on HBO on 21 February with a UK date yet to be announced"
Pelé review – valedictory tribute to Brazilian football great,Netflix’s admiring documentary about the three-time World Cup champion is best when it focuses on Brazil’s turbulent 1960s,3,"Here’s a slightly more upscale contribution to the deluge of feature-length football documentaries that have flooded our screens in the last few years. Pelé is the apex talent who underpinned Brazil’s rise to unquenchable glory in the 1960s, culminating in the epic 1970 victory over Italy in the World Cup final – itself crowned by the endlessly replayed Carlos Alberto goal set up by Pelé’s cute lay-off: the cherry on the icing of the cake of football’s golden age.In truth, Pelé is’s stardom was partly founded on his smiley, boy-next-door persona and he is a fundamentally undramatic figure – certainly compared to the chaotic lord-of-misrule that was Diego Maradona, his only serious rival in the greatest-of-all-time stakes. Consequently, this admiring profile is considerably more sedate than Asif Kapadia’s rollicking biography of Maradona, though benefiting from an extensive interview with Pelé, who is now unable to walk without assistance.While Pelé’s footballing feats – inspiring Brazil to three World Cup wins, spending almost his entire career knocking in more than 1,000 goals for the same small Brazilian club, a brief foray to New York in the mid-70s – may seem to belong to ancient history, there’s a comfort-blanket familiarity about running through them once again. Where this film does turn up interesting material is by filling in the context of Brazil’s turbulent history in the 60s and highlighting Pelé’s participation in legitimising the military coup. Pelé maintains his ingenuous stance was entirely non-political, but there is a degree of bitterness on show from contemporaries who didn’t have his celebrity privilege. And it’s eye-opening to see the tensions preceding the 1970 World Cup, given Brazil’s triumph, seemed pre-ordained.But Pelé still possesses plenty of untarnished lustre as, arguably, the world’s first black sporting superstar, and the gold standard for footballing achievement for decades. (The Viagra ads he did at the turn of the millennium somehow don’t get a mention.) This valedictory film allows sober recognition for all that he did. Available from 23 February on Netflix."
Blush review – midlife crisis drama leaves you discontent and unfulfilled ,Wendi McLendon-Covey’s bored wife Cathy endures a series of seriocomic crises but they never really lead anywhere,2,"As the lead turn in this burb-midlife crisis dramedy, Wendi McLendon-Covey repeatedly does a facial expression which can best be called stunned-discontentment-and-incredulity. It is, if nothing else, appropriate for the very eventful script from writer-director Debra Eisenstadt, that packs in loads of ideas and situations, and brings us to a series of contrived seriocomic crises, after which the dramatic temperature is reset to normal in the succeeding scene. At one stage McLendon-Covey’s character gets hit by a car, and simply limps away with the same satirically grumpy face and a bruise to show for it. It’s not totally clear if the surreal effect is intentional.McLendon-Covey plays Cathy, a woman who is bored and unfulfilled in her uptight marriage to Matthew (Steve Little, the dorky teacher Stevie Janowski from TV’s Eastbound & Down) and anxious about her relationship with her teen daughter Tara – a very good performance from Kate Alberts. When she goes cat sitting for her querulous sister Gail (Catherine Curtin), Cathy finds herself fascinated by Gail’s dodgy neighbours: substance abuser Gemma Jean (Christine Woods), her husband Paul (Graham Sibley) and their teen son Xander (Max Burkholder). Gemma Jean shares inappropriately with Cathy, and both Paul and Xander seem attracted to her.Blush plays out along the classic American Beauty lines: menopausal sexual adventure for the grownups in ironic parallel with a disruptive emotional awakening for the teens a generation below. Tara even does an outrageously sexy group dance on the high-school stage which is taken straight from the Oscar-winning film. Matthew seems entirely enraptured by this, incidentally – odd, considering how cross he is later about Tara’s apparent relationship with a much older boy. In the end, this movie doesn’t really go anywhere or do anything. Released on 22 February on digital platforms."
Digger review – family tensions are unearthed in slow-burn Greek drama,A corporate destruction project offers a symbolic backdrop for this poignant drama about a father-son relationship ,3,"Its plot featuring a giant mining corporation known as “the monster” tearing up the landscape and causing bitter division among the hard-drinking local populace, this handsomely shot drama could be taking place in rust-belt America. But this is backwoods Greece, where forest rancher Nikitas (Vangelis Mourikis), first seen fending off a landslide caused by the miners’ activities, is fighting a running battle to keep them from despoiling the haven he loves. A motorbike throttle at midnight announces the arrival of his estranged son Johnny (Argyris Pandazaras), whose need to claim his inheritance adds to the pressure on Nikitas to ship out.With this father-son conflict, and a liking for contemporary imagery like Johnny’s motocross track to liven up the classicism, director Georgis Grigorakis in his feature debut makes a claim on the same kind of romantic-realist territory as Jacques Audiard.Father and son are forced to cohabit in Nikitas’s forest cabin; their feuding starts small – he tries to make Johnny wear slippers inside – but gradually becomes inflamed by past grievances. Mourikis, looking like a skulking Leonard Cohen, coolly underplays the resentment and regrets until they explode at the corporate lackeys, like when they cut down his walnut tree.It’s a shame that, as it ramps up, this generational tension isn’t dramatised with the sharpness it might have been. Johnny is more thinly drawn, leaving Digger over-reliant on Nikitas’s selfish idealism – and some occasionally on-the-nose scenes revolving around it. Luckily, Grigorakis’ breakdown of the town’s factions is more subtle. And he and cinematographer Giorgos Karvelas not only have an eye for striking visuals, but they know how to use them in amplifying counterpoint: the forest dells are filmed with the protective intimacy Nikitas feels for them, as against the shock and awe of the mining excavator’s behemoth teeth. A bracing backdrop for a world-weary but engaging film.Released on 16 February on Mubi."
"Saturday Night Live: Regina King shines, cast mines Trump impeachment ",Alex Moffat’s Tucker Carlson was weaselly the best thing in a lame cold open. Maybe the show should just move on,0,"We open on Tucker Carlson Tonight. After rolling through “a loose collection of scare-mongering non-sequiturs”, the weaselly Carlson (Alex Moffat, a bang-on impression) moves on to cover Donald Trump’s acquittal in the Senate.He welcomes Trump “teacher’s pet” Lindsey Graham (Kate McKinnon), who wants the country to focus on the really important issues: “Locking up Hillary and freeing beautiful Britney Spears.” He’s joined by fellow Republican senator Ted Cruz (Aidy Bryant), who has to swallow his pride and carry water for Trump even though Trump called Cruz’s wife ugly in 2016.Bad impressions of Trump’s defense team follow, before things wrap up with a short visit from Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell (Beck Bennett), who “pretzels out” his logic for voting to acquit despite thinking Trump is “guilty as hell, and the worst person I ever met, and I hope every city, county and state locks his ass up!”While the cold opens of the past few weeks haven’t been any great shakes, this lazy, laughless excuse for political commentary is a reminder of the show at its worst.Tonight's first guest is... pic.twitter.com/85Ydqmm7Q9Regina King hosts. The Oscar-winning actor and new director notes that “if you’re black, you probably know me from being in some of your favorite movies, and if you’re white you probably know me from Watchmen – or this monologue right now.” She’s joined by Kenan Thompson, dressed like a member of Run DMC, as her hype man, berating some of the audience for “NOT CLAPPING LOUD ENOUGH”.What’s Your Type is a dating show on MTV. King plays the “sexy single” looking for a “cringy white dude in his early 40s”. The three contestants include a guy trying way too hard to show his feminist bona fides, a musician who bursts into song at the drop of a hat (in his case, a lame fedora), and an awkward dweeb who can’t keep from doing high-pitched joke voices. Somehow, they all get King’s motor running. She picks the dweeb.Peletaunt is the cynic’s answer to Peleton. Instead of relying on standard corny inspiration, the machine’s virtual coaches “pull from emotional manipulation techniques”, such as insults, pranks, “avoidant attachment style” and withering judgment, to gaslight users into giving their all.Next, King and Thompson play married lawyers who help get settlements for people who used Gorilla Glue as a hair product. “It’s a mistake that could happen to anybody,” they explain, “like brushing your teeth with Preparation H”. Ego Nwodim, Chris Redd, Cecily Strong and Punkie Johnson play the “NOT stupid people” they represent.A group of friends gather over wine. The suburbanite women all give the birthday girl kitschy decorative signs which start off innocently – “Wine gets better with age, I get better with wine” – but quickly turn dark: “Hey barkeep, I want to die tonight” , “I drink too much”, “My sponsor thinks I’m in bed”, “I am sexually promiscuous and my house is dirty”. Then, King plays a police negotiator dealing with a hostage situation after unknowingly eating a bag of weed gummies. Both sketches start promisingly but neither goes as crazy or as dark as it could.The night’s musical guest is Nathaniel Rateliff, who performs Redemption. On Weekend Update, Colin Jost laments the outcome of impeachment, the “dumbest trial ever”. Speaking from a black perspective, Michael Che isn’t surprised Trump was acquitted, explaining, “Just because there’s video evidence, doesn’t mean you’re going to get a conviction.”Their first guest is QAnon member Stephanie Green (McKinnon), a witch – as in, green skin, long nose with boil, pointed hat – who only joined the group to learn more about that secret cabal of child-eaters. It’s impressive anyone thought this idea could bear a minute’s worth of jokes, let alone three or four.…are you ladies trying to tell her something? pic.twitter.com/FlIoVafFG2A little later, Drunk Tom Brady (Bennett) shows up to celebrate his Super Bowl victory. He angrily chastises former coach Bill Belichick (“You’re not my dad anymore!”), uses his beat-up trophy to pop the top off a beer bottle and spirals into depression over how nobody likes him. “Thought they would talk about the wins … but all they talk about is how I kiss my sons.”Disco diva Fliona gets ready to perform a concert in Chicago, only to find none of her demands have been met. Everyone is having fun playing 70s caricatures and rolling through tricky tongue twisters, but the sketch ends far too abruptly, apparently cut for time. Still, the cast, King and Bowen Yang particularly, acquit themselves with screwball aplomb.In the final sketch, a grade school assembly welcomes a feminist theater group who perform a “child-friendly version” of their Vagina Monologues-esque show. They swap out the title body part for elbows but it’s clear what they’re talking about. Credit to King and the show for slipping a “See You Next Tuesday” joke past the censors. Then Ratliff and his band, The Night Sweats, close the show with A Little Honey.This was a decent enough episode, with low-key laughs throughout. King has always been an excellent comedic actor, so it’s no surprise she felt at home. It’s only too bad she wasn’t given that one great, memorable sketch to showcase her powers to the full. Hopefully she returns soon."
Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar review – Wiig and Mumolo laughing all the way to the beach,Bridesmaids co-writers Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo reunite as holidaying friends sucked into a hokey sci-fi conspiracy,3,"This fun and diverting comedy from work wives Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo, who co-wrote 2011’s Bridesmaids, has a silly premise. After being made redundant, culotte-wearing besties Barb (Mumolo) and Star (Wiig) use their severance pay to escape their midwestern hometown for a holiday at the Palm Vista Hotel in Florida. It’s a “middle-aged paradise”, and so Edgar (Jamie Dornan), the young Irish heartthrob they meet at the bar, sticks out like a sore thumb. He’s there on business, involved in a sinister plot involving genetically modified mosquitos.The sci-fi stuff is tedious, but Wiig and Mumolo are bawdy and brilliant as ever, their effortless chemistry bolstered by years of collaboration. As for Dornan, a notably sombre and wooden screen presence in the Fifty Shades of Grey movies, he is required to prance about a sandy beach, participate in several musical numbers and even shake a pair of maracas. He’s an interesting, amusing casting choice, genuinely endearing here as a supervillain’s accomplice and wannabe boyfriend. Comedy, it seems, is a less awkward fit.Available on multiple VOD platforms"
Good Grief review – tender film-play hybrid hits home,Original Theatre; available onlineSian Clifford and Nikesh Patel rehearsed for two days on Zoom before being filmed in a studio in Lorien Haynes’s impressively naturalistic bereavement story,4,"Sorrow is in the air. This is a tender time to watch a play about loss and the patching up of lives. Good Grief, Lorien Haynes’s acute new two-hander, looks at the heightened awareness that follows bereavement, charting the months after the death of a young woman, when her boyfriend and her best friend learn to cope, together and apart. Sian Clifford – familiar as Fleabag’s sister and the wife of the coughing major in Quiz – is taut, lapped by hysteria. Nikesh Patel – Foaly in Artemis Fowl – bubbles with sadness and anxiety. Subtle and volatile, they sob and snipe – and freewheel wildly.Director Natalie Abrahami is among those helping to give online drama a new assurance. Good Grief is light years away from the Zoom plays of last spring; nor is it a capture of a live stage play. A conscious hybrid – rehearsed in two days on Zoom, filmed in a studio – it sets out to combine the immediacy of the stage with the intimacy afforded by film. Forty-five minutes slip by with an easy naturalism that would be hard to match on stage: no one wants to sit in the dress circle unable to hear actors mumbling their lines through a mouthful of food.Yet theatricality and artifice are frequently underlined. Black-and-white sequences at the opening and between scenes show the crew setting up cameras. Scenery is minimal, sometimes parodically rough: a cardboard box is labelled “cupboard”. Crucially, dialogue drives the plot. Haynes’s script does not bellow, but nor is it underwritten. It is another blend: casual and highly wrought; throwaway closeup. “Nothing says thank you like a bit of vag,” drawls Clifford at the wake. Grief is not simply about feeling sad, after all: it involves piecing things together, looking with startled alertness at what we have taken for granted.Available to watch online from 15 February, 7.30pm until 15 April, 11.55pm"
Dead Pigs review – winding tale of life in cash-crazed Shanghai,"Cathy Yan’s sprawling drama uses a real-life discovery of 16,000 porcine corpses to pick away at Chinese commercialism",3,"A breezily westernised style of Chinese movie is on offer in this 2018 debut feature from Chinese-American film-maker Cathy Yan, who two years later went to Hollywood to direct Birds of Prey, starring Margot Robbie. Dead Pigs is an ensemble dramedy set in Shanghai that satirises – in a distinctly lenient way – the commercialism eating away at China’s heart. It is inspired by a real-life incident in which thousands of dead pigs were found in the city’s Huangpu river, dumped by poverty-stricken farmers who couldn’t pay the disposal fees; the pig symbolism reminded me a tiny bit of Alan Bennett’s A Private Function.Candy Wang (Vivian Wu) is a beauty salon owner who lives in her parents’ rickety old house, the only one standing in a rubble-strewn waste ground, because she is holding out against offers from a property company called Golden Happiness; it wants to build a bizarre Vegas-style development there based on Barcelona, complete with a tacky replica of the Sagrada Família. Her brother Old Wang (Haoyu Yang) is in dire financial trouble after borrowing money from gangsters to fund his absurd “investment portfolio” in pigs, which have all died. Old Wang’s son Zhen (Mason Lee) is a hard-up waiter who pretends to his dad he’s doing well; he befriends wealthy Instagram-style princess Xia Xia (Meng Li) and soon finds out how lonely and unhappy she really is. Meanwhile, Golden Happiness have hired a smooth American architect called Sean (David Rysdahl), whose US qualifications are phoney: he has been recruited by another American, Angie (Zazie Beetz), for sideline work as a model for promo events, pretending to be an American celeb or reality TV star.The movie zings and pinballs around, ricocheting within its ironic pattern of coincidences, and those dead pigs keep bobbing metaphorically up, reported by TV news broadcasts – always a cheesy and unconvincing storytelling technique. Dead Pigs is an unassuming topical entertainment (rather different from the movies of its executive producer Jia Zhangke), but diverting and well-acted. Released on 12 February on Mubi."
Slalom review – abuse on the slopes in tense teen ski prodigy drama,A French teen ski champion navigates sexual exploitation by her male coach in Charlène Favier’s difficult but impressive debut,3,"Is this a tale of abuse, or forbidden love? Or is there something insidious in asking that question, suggesting an ambiguity that will err leniently on the side of love? Slalom is the debut feature by director and co-writer Charlène Favier, who has indicated that it is drawn from personal experience and her own teen years growing up in the ski resort of Val-d’Isère in south-eastern France. It is impeccably acted and beautifully shot, although I wondered if it is burdened by a softcore-tasteful aesthetic and a tactful reluctance to take its own narrative implications very far. The movie finishes on an unresolved chord, as if we have left the story months or years before the actual scandalous denouement. But it is arguably faithful to the mood of messy bewilderment and frustration that governs the ongoing situation.A retired slalom ski champion – whose retirement might have been due to injury – is now pouring all his passion and frustration into coaching in a facility leased from a school. This is Fred, played by Jérémie Renier, who is a fierce and exacting teacher of teenage skiers, turning them into possible national champions and even future contestants at the Olympic Games. Almost from the very first, it is clear that his star pupil is 16-year-old Lyz, played by Noée Abita, who has got what it takes both in terms of skill and energy but also those dark, fissile ingredients of submission and self-abasement. Her divorced mum Catherine (Muriel Combeau) is away working in Marseille, and has a new boyfriend there, leaving Lyz alone in the apartment.So Lyz is lonely, in need of love and a parent figure. Fred is dynamic and compelling, but with an abuser’s mastery of combining insults with praise: he humiliates Lyz and berates her in front of the others (because he believes in her, naturally, and is supposedly angry at her for falling short of her potential) and then switches devastatingly to gentleness and praise and a boyish delight when she wins. When Lyz’s academic grades start to slide (her ski training is conditional on good schoolwork) and her mother confesses she can’t be at home to help with her studies, Fred suggests that Lyz move in with him and his partner, Lilou (Marie Denarnaud).Favier cleverly shows how, when the sexual approaches happen, they are horribly inevitable because they fold into a physically intimate existence that Fred has spent many months getting Lyz used to. The training process has actually been grooming (a word once associated with preparing someone for greatness or stardom). The initial scenes in which Fred briskly and unselfconsciously tells Lyz to strip to her underwear (in his office, with no one else present) so he can weigh her and measure her body fat are almost unwatchable, because the movie, like Fred’s face, is deadpan. More obviously charged is the moment when Fred comes to see Lyz in the girls’ showers (she has not removed her costume) and tells her to be proud of her periods.But there is nothing deadpan or ambiguous about what happens later. The key question is: who else knows and has it happened before? The grey area between passionately committed teaching and abuse is a familiar topic. Yet the film ingeniously merges it with the ambiguous experience of slalom ski-ing: exhilarating and euphoric, but also dangerous and even an emotional death-wish, surrendering to the downhill rush. Released on 12 February on Curzon Home Cinema."
Death Becomes Her: Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn's schlocky pursuit of eternal youth,Two hyper-competitive frenemies seek the help of the dark arts to stay young in Robert Zemeckis’s 1992 comedy that became a cult classic,0,"What does it mean to age gracefully? In Robert Zemeckis and David Koepp’s supernatural black comedy, Death Becomes Her, the strong suggestion is that staying happy, healthy and wrinkle-free isn’t really about wellness, but more about being well-connected.The film’s leading ladies Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn were both in their mid-40s when the film premiered in 1992. Although the story celebrates the allure of magic in a world obsessed with science, the issues explored felt real and personal: Streep once famously referred to the film as a documentary on LA’s obsession with hiding natural signs of ageing.Death Becomes Her is set in 1970s Hollywood – an era in which regular plastic surgery appointments, unfaithful partners, faking your own death for self-preservation, and carrying a can of skin-tint spray paint in your purse were on-trend.At the heart of this romantic-comedy-gone-sour are two hyper-competitive frenemies, both struggling to confront their own mortality: has-been Broadway star Madeline Ashton (Streep) and deeply insecure writer Helen Sharp (Hawn). Their life’s mission? To one-up each other, professionally and personally. Ashton steals Sharp’s fiance; Sharp emerges years later as a fresh-faced published author. Ashton secretly chases a younger love interest when bored of her new husband; Sharp plots a way to get her ex-fiance to fall back in love with her.A twisted love triangle forms with the fickle plastic surgeon-turned-reconstructive mortician Ernest Menville (Bruce Willis, for whom the role was a sharp detour from the hypermasculinity of the first two Die Hard movies). Once celebrated for doing his finest work on keeping Hollywood’s shiniest stars wrinkle-free, he’s now reduced to the under-appreciated art of helping the deceased look more natural than they did when alive.One stormy night, Ashton is dumped by her younger, secret boyfriend who’s embarrassed by the age gap. Crushed, she ends up on the doorstep of Lisle Von Rhuman (played by the enchanting Isabella Rossellini), a wealthy socialite dealing in the dark arts.Von Rhuman, sympathetic to Ashton’s age-related insecurities, has the answer to making all those problems (wrinkles, under-eye bags and sagging skin) disappear: a rare and expensive magic potion that promises at least a decade of perfect, unchanged beauty.On paper, it’s a dream come true. But this is Beverly Hills, so there’s a catch: beauty is pain, and the curse of siempre viva (that’s Spanish for “always alive”) means your body – for better or worse – remains stubbornly immortal, surviving even the most gruesome accidents.This witchy, absurdist feature film was woefully ahead of its time, predicting the rise of scripted reality television with its no-details-spared scenes and plot twists. Despite being a commercial success (grossing $149m worldwide), the movie was critically panned as pitiful and grotesque. It went on, however, to capture the imagination of a younger generation of drag queens and cult-obsessed cosplayers, as well as develop a growing queer fandom.In the early 90s, it was unheard of to recreate lifelike human skin and body parts with computer graphics on-screen, like a 180-degree headspin or a gaping gunshot inflicted gut hole. But Death Becomes Her relies on these gloriously gauche special effects as set pieces, for which the film’s visual effects team won an Oscar and a Bafta.Although the film starts out as a revenge plot, steeped in pettiness and sorcery, what unravels alongside the tranquilliser-spiked wine glasses and outdoor bloodbaths is an oddly endearing story of female friendship – and the importance of choosing to hold each other up (sometimes in the most literal sense) instead of succumbing to rivalry. Death Becomes Her is available to stream in Australia on Foxtel Go and Binge. For more recommendations of what to stream in Australia, click here"
If It Were Love review – a dance doc powered by the exuberance of youth,Patric Chiha’s film follows a troupe through intimate rehearsals and draws its charm from the carefree energy of its performers,3,"There is a delicate mixture of sensuality and creativity in this documentary. Patric Chiha follows the rehearsal and performance of a dance piece called Crowd by the Franco-Austrian artist and choreographer Gisèle Vienne, about the 90s club scene. The film follows the dance itself and stages one-on-one conversation scenes in which the young dancers talk about each other and the characters they play – a higher gossip, perhaps, about their lives and how this fictional creation shapes their sense of themselves and their sexuality.Compared with, say, Gaspar Noé’s orgiastic dance movie Climax, If It Were Love is certainly more calm and less mad, more ruminative and less confrontational. Perhaps what it is about fundamentally is youth, something each dancer radiates unknowingly: a pure energy and abandon and openness.It would be better to witness this dance piece live (a Covid-era yearning) but there is something interesting in seeing this eternal theme of youth explored and embodied. A dancer might talk about how a kiss did not happen with another character on stage – or, alternatively, that it did happen – and the exchange feels personally charged and intimate, like a conversation taking place after a party, with people confiding who they think they are in love with. And of course to some extent these conversations themselves are fictional performances, which the film builds into the official choreography.If It Were Love is probably more of a festival event film than anything, but it is valuable and pregnant with ideas. Released on 11 February on Mubi."
"Life in a Day 2020 review – ambitious, bizarre and hugely exasperating",Kevin Macdonald’s film aims to give a snapshot of the modern world but its context-free clips look more like a corporate ad,2,"Sensory overload and incoherence are sadly the dominant qualities of this idealistic crowdsourced YouTube video project from director Kevin Macdonald and executive producer Ridley Scott, which is about everything and nothing.It is a follow-up to Macdonald’s Life in a Day movie from 2011, in which legions of people responded to a request to send in homemade videos on what they were doing on a certain day in 2010: a time-capsule snapshot mosaic from all over the world. This time he and Scott put out a worldwide call for people to record all the various sad, funny, passionate or banal things they were doing on 25 July 2020; he got 324,000 videos from 192 countries.Macdonald has edited all this down to an 87-minute presentation, which he has modified here and there with background music; some videos are broken up into micro-episodes and spread out over the collection, building in one case to a poignant twist ending.A decade on from the first film, smartphones with higher-quality cameras have probably resulted in a technically more sophisticated haul; people have better equipment and are arguably more savvy about curating their content. More people are sending in drone footage with impressive high-def 4K images.There are vehemently presented slices of life, with fierce comments on the Covid pandemic, racism, the climate crisis, poverty and inequality. Yet mulching all these themes together has the effect of giving equal weight to all the video molecules. It makes for a bland coleslaw of user-generated content, however startling and even remarkable the individual strands are. Exasperatingly, we are mostly not told where exactly they were filmed and the context-free mood makes it feel like a gigantic we-are-the-world corporate ad for life insurance.There are some absorbing vignettes. A man proposes to his girlfriend in a beauty spot but is rejected; a Japanese woman tells her boyfriend (who is doing the filming) that she believes their relationship is doomed, and begins to cry.Some of the videos don’t earn their keep on any level. A train-spotter kid makes it his business to film seven types of train on a single day in Illinois … that’s niche, to put it mildly. But I enjoyed the bored guy in lockdown who had given names to all the spiders in his apartment.Easily the strongest moment is when a mother reveals that the adored teenage son who appeared in the first Life in a Day film has died of Covid. Macdonald may well have considered, if only for a second, making this film a complete follow-up for every single one of the people in that original, but discarded it as too close to Michael Apted’s Up series. And yet that mother’s testimony was powerful not merely in what it revealed but in its structural form. It had the compelling quality of narrative: that was then, this is now. The rest of this film is almost entirely formless. However moved or touched you may be by any particular moment, it is disconcerting to have that moment replaced by something completely different – tragic followed by quirky, funny followed by bleak – so you can’t process or understand the emotion.This is a high-minded project conceived on an ambitious scale. But, for me, in the end there was an image satiety that was unrewarding.Life in a Day 2020 is screening at the Sundance film festival on 1 February, then available on YouTube from 6 February."
Running Naked review – feelgood cancer comedy with teen pranks,Two teenagers who bonded in hospital grow up and have to deal with the effects of their illnesses in a film that might have worked better as a sitcom,2,"This awkward British feelgood cancer comedy by director Victor Buhler never entirely comes together, switching from serious to silly and not exactly comfortable in either tone or register. What Running Naked has got going for it are two likable supporting performances by Samuel Bottomley and James Senneck as Mark and Ben, teenage cancer patients who meet in a Manchester hospital. Bored and terrified, they make mischief on the wards. (There’s a funny scene in which they make a break for it, reaching as far as the carpark before realising there’s nowhere to go, and skulk back to their beds.)Skip ahead 15 years, and the film is on shakier ground. Now in their 30s, Mark and Ben (played by Matthew McNulty and Andrew Gower, respectively) survived but live with an increased risk of developing cancer as adults. Mark is a doctor on the same ward where the pair were treated as lads. He’s the more successful of the two, but is held back emotionally by a nagging fear that bad things happen to him. So he laddishly dumps the love of his life, fellow doctor Jade (Rakhee Thakrar), before anything goes wrong with the relationship. Still, he’s loyal to his old mate Ben.Grownup Ben is more problematic. He’s dweeby, anaemic-looking and wears a terrible cardboard-coloured suit – imagine Jarvis Cocker playing Mr Bean. Since remission he has suffered from hygiene-related obsessive behaviours, and there is something questionable in the way his struggles get played for laughs. The script here is unkind and unfunny, and perhaps actually backfires, since many of us can now relate to applying hand sanitiser every five minutes. The plot hinges on a twist you can see coming for miles; this is one of those Britfilms with a sitcom feel. It might have worked better over four or five episodes with sharpening of the script – and more teenage pranks. Available from 8 February on digital formats."
The Sparks Brothers review – Edgar Wright's electric portrait of the pop duo,The director’s imaginative documentary covers the often underappreciated career of Sparks in a funny and vibrant manner,4,"Edgar Wright’s films have always been palpably clever, energetic and they revel in existing outside of clear genre lines. It’s a natural fit, then, that his first documentary would focus on the art pop duo Sparks, a palpably clever and energetic band who revel in existing outside clear genre lines.Those who know and love Sparks should prepare for 135 minutes of archival ecstasy, as Wright’s The Sparks Brothers is a beat-by-beat close read of Ron and Russell Mael’s career from their late 1960s college experiments to today. Newcomers to this beloved cult group, which is certainly most people, especially in the United States, will find that Wright’s technique swiftly knocks down the barriers of entry with 50 years of material. The reason why some people are absolutely in love with Sparks is that Sparks are fun, and you just have to hear it and see it to get it.Ron, 75, and Russell, 73, were born in the Los Angeles area, even though they’ve been mistaken for British for most of their careers. Their father, who was an artist and illustrator, died when they were young, and their doting mother was cool enough to take them to see the Beatles twice. As they got interested in music Ron, the thinner and perhaps weirder one, wrote most of the tunes. He plays keyboards and for years sported what was either a Charlie Chaplin or Adolf Hitler mustache, depending on how you wanted to read it. Russell had more typical rock god looks, and their first albums differentiated themselves with rich, humorous lyrics and instantly catchy melodies.They sounded a bit like the Kinks and Roxy Music, and soon found more success in the UK than back home. There was also an element of camp to their whole career – “are they kidding with this?” is a question that hangs over so much of their best work. The single This Town Ain’t Big Enough for the Both of Us from the 1974 album Kimono My House nearly out-Queens Queen with its operatic bombast. Their Top of the Pops debut was one of those life-changing television broadcasts for people looking for unconventional music acts.But whenever they got into a groove, whether it connected with audiences or not, they were driven to change direction. Their vaudevillian pop with producer Todd Rundgren turned to a grander, studio-symphony sound with producer Tony Visconti. As the punk and No Wave scene was happening they relocated to New York, then ditched that to collaborate with Giorgio Moroder for 1979’s No 1 in Heaven, one of the first all-synthesizer pop-rock albums. Later albums grew even more difficult to describe. Some had a minor hit or two, others went straight into obscurity. But their frugal living and determination prevented them from ever retiring as the legend just grew.Edgar Wright’s movie is more than just a typical portrait of artists. While the structure is quite rigid (all 25 Sparks albums get their bullet point) the formality allows Wright and the Maels to color outside the lines. The Sparks Brothers employs stop motion and 2D animation, re-enactment video, cheeky “lower third” graphics, props and even moving cameras during talking head videos. Wright knows some people won’t want to watch a long documentary about a band they’ve never heard of, so he’s sure to keep it funny and alive at every possible turn.With Sparks being “musicians’ musicians” there’s no shortage of luminaries eager to sing their praises. (Beck, Flea, “Weird Al” Yankovic and Jonathan Ross are just the tip of the iceberg here.) What’s strange, though, is that the film seems a little uneasy about getting to know the Maels beyond their personas.Part of their whole mystique is how mercurial they are, but Wright seems, at the beginning, to announce that we’ll finally get to know these guys. One of the first questions seems the most personal: whether they are gay or straight. (They are straight.) But other than a small period in time when Russell dated Jane Wiedlin of the Go-Go’s, we don’t hear a thing about other relationships. It is also baffling that not once in this movie is it mentioned that the Maels are Jewish. They were born just years after the Holocaust to parents named Meyer and Miriam, and have steadily devoted their lives to being outsider artists. For year’s Ron was described as “that Hitler guy”. You’d think at some point during this extremely in-depth documentary the topic would come up.But we do watch the pair work at a humble home studio, learn Russell’s coffee order and see Ron’s snow globe collection. This is a film that loves its subjects and only someone with a biological revulsion to catchy pop or grand rock theatrics will dislike the film. For most, Sparks is uncharted territory. Luckily there’s a lot to explore.The Sparks Brothers is screening at the Sundance film festival with a release date to be announced"
Clementine review – lakeside retreat harbours damp passions,A spurned young woman’s urge to retaliate becomes subsumed by an oddly intense affair,2,"There is some interesting material in Clementine, but it is an indulgent mood piece, unfocused and unfinished, and one that feels like an idea for a short film, but stretched out to feature length. Otmara Marrero plays Karen, a woman deeply hurt at being dumped by her older, wealthier lover D (Sonya Walger), who has moreover kept Karen’s beloved dog, Ramsey. In an angry, confused and vengeful mood, Karen drives to D’s beautiful lake house, where they had spent so much blissful time together, and breaks in – just to hang out, or somehow to assert herself. But here she encounters Lana (Sydney Sweeney), a disconcertingly smart, beautiful woman sunbathing by the lake, and a weirdly intense relationship develops between the two of them.Exasperatingly, we are asked to stay tuned for long periods of time while the sexual tension between Karen and Lana smoulders inconclusively away, but then the dramatic focus lurches over to Beau (Will Brittain), a hunky guy who has come to do odd jobs around the lake house, but may be spying on Karen on D’s behalf, and may have designs on Lana. Then he, too, is upstaged in the toxic male sexual danger department by some creepy guys Lana knows, claiming to have contacts in the LA movie business. They have a video camera at their place and give innocent Lana an “audition”. Afterwards, this is the subject of an actor-ish monologue by Lana, which itself feels like an audition piece. (It certainly should go on Sydney Sweeney’s showreel.)Where are we going with all this? Nowhere very satisfying: there is a lot of non-suspense leading to non-thrills and non-revelation of character. The performancesby Marrero and Sweeney, though, are perfectly fair. Released on digital formats on 8 February."
Twist review – try-hard reboot spray paints over Dickens' tale,Rafferty Law’s young hero is a graffiti artist and Michael Caine’s Fagin an ex-art dealer in this under-par update of Oliver Twist,2,"Michael Caine already has the distinction of appearing in what many believe is the greatest Dickens adaptation of all time: The Muppets Christmas Carol, in which he played Scrooge. Now he is Fagin in this try-hard modern reboot of Oliver Twist, in which the plot and indeed meaning of the original has been jettisoned, leaving few of the characters – though the original’s tiny, sticky-fingered tealeaves are now promoted to supercool young adulthood. It never really comes to life and there’s a kids-TV feel to most of it, although the free-running scenes are watchable enough, and Caine’s disguise as a grumpy Russian plutocrat with a fake moustache raises some laughs.Rafferty Law (the dead spit of his dad, Jude Law) plays Twist, a young graffiti artist who gets roped into street crime and finds himself hanging out with some cheeky but nonviolent young chancers in Fagin’s employ: a gender-switched Dodge (Rita Ora), and a character called Red (Sophie Simnett), who is in an abusive relationship with another gender-switched character, Sikes, played by Lena Headey. Caine’s Fagin turns out to be a former art dealer ruined by an unscrupulous competitor (enjoyably played by David Walliams), so Fagin plans an elaborate robbery to get his own back on this absolute rotter.And so we are in caper-theft territory, with people disguising themselves as police officers, lowering themselves into lifts from a hole in a ceiling, spray painting over CCTV cameras and pinching Old Masters. Noel Clarke and Jason Maza are Brownlow and Bedwin, the flat-footed coppers on Twist’s trail, but hardly able to keep up with his parkour shenanigans. This movie’s not unlikable, but the action and comedy are under par. Twist is released on Sky Cinema on 29 January."
The Capote Tapes review – inside the iconic writer's ice-cold mind,Ebs Burnough’s doc centres on Truman Capote’s unfinished novel but its real intrigue is its subject’s unknowable psyche,4,"There’s a necrophiliac fascination to this documentary about the life and times of Truman Capote, author of the 1958 novella Breakfast at Tiffany’s – filmed with Audrey Hepburn – and the true-crime reportage masterpiece In Cold Blood from 1966. The latter was about the brutal slaying of a Kansas farming family in which the cold-bloodedness of the crime was matched by the cold-bloodedness of Capote’s literary and journalistic performance – befriending the culprits with prison visits and privately agitating for their death penalty to give his book a sensational ending. If anyone had the splinter of ice in the heart that Graham Greene said a novelist needed, it was him.Capote was also a gay man in an era when being one was dangerous, but when those prominent in the arts could hide it in plain sight with extravagant mannerisms. Norman Mailer admired his courage and I found myself thinking of a German word invented by the English writer Ben Schott: schmetterlingsschnauze, or “butterfly jaws” – the toughness of the dandy.This film from Ebs Burnough, based on a cache of audiotaped interviews with Capote’s intimates made by Paris Review editor George Plimpton, is chiefly about the strange case of Capote’s unfinished novel, Answered Prayers. This was his anatomy of the New York idle rich with whom Capote mingled and for whom he threw the supposedly legendary Black and White Ball in New York in 1966, a bafflingly iconic event whose guest list – like the cast of people on whom Answered Prayers is based – now seems mostly like a pageant of wealthy mediocrities and Eurotrash narcissists. Maybe Capote’s novel-fragment attacking them was intended as the definitive, contemptuous dismissal: a final flick of the switch on the electric chair.But the contempt was surely also for himself. When a few chapters were published, it apparently lost him some A-lister friends, though he gained new ones to hang out with at Studio 54 in the 70s, including his acolyte Andy Warhol – who was really Capote’s cultural heir in the new age of celebrity. (This film could have said more about their relationship.) It is salutary to be reminded of a great writer, whose heyday was at a time when literary authors were at the centre of culture.Released on 29 January on digital formats."
The Queen of Black Magic review – derivative gross-out horror,An Indonesian family’s trip to the orphanage where dad grew up turns into an unrelenting stream of nastiness as vengeful spirits emerge,2,"Leaving their home in Jakarta, well-to-do dad Hanif (Ario Bayu), his wife Nadya (Hannah Al Rashid) and their three kids drive to the remote rural orphanage where Hanif grew up. At first, it’s all laughs and backseat bickering – until the car hits something. Having established that the collision was with a now dead deer, they drive off, only for the camera to reveal that the real victim was a child, now dead in a ditch. Up comes the title card, by which point viewers of this Indonesian horror will have some inkling that The Queen of Black Magic isn’t going to mess around.After this unnerving first 10 minutes, there is a long expository lull as an unwieldy cast of characters is introduced. These include the two guys Hanif was best friends with back at the orphanage, their wives, enigmatic servants, two of the current teenage residents, and the dying old man who ran the place. Eventually, after a couple of creepy anecdotes about demons and madwomen locked in bedrooms, the action finally kicks in with a pretty unrelenting stream of horror. Possessions by unquiet spirits result in regurgitated caterpillars, millipedes in eye sockets, someone getting their mouth stapled shut, a woman with an eating disorder mutilating her body, and a bus full of corpses. Then it gets really nasty.Director Kimo Stamboel deploys some clever visual effects and trick camera angles to heighten the gross-out factor – a twist reveals the agent of chaos isn’t just cruel but seeking justice for historical abuse. But ultimately it is all a bit repetitive, derivative (particularly of other Asian horror pics) and somewhat sleep-inducing. The Queen of Black Magic is available on Shudder from 29 January."
Assassins review – the 'prank show' killing of North Korea's pretender,This gripping documentary explores the story of the two young women who carried out a nerve-agent attack on Kim Jong-nam,4,"Nothing to do with the 1990 musical by Stephen Sondheim about the people throughout history who have tried to kill the US president … yet maybe this film should itself be turned into a musical or opera. It is a documentary about the extraordinary 2017 assassination of Kim Jong-nam, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s half-brother, who had been living in exile in China and was not merely a persistent critic of the regime but seen as a possible alternative ruler.Bizarrely, Kim Jong-nam was killed by having VX nerve agent smeared in his face in Kuala Lumpur international airport’s departure hall by two young women, Siti Aisyah and Doan Thi Houng – from Indonesia and Vietnam respectively – who had been duped by North Korean agents posing as TV producers into thinking they were filming a hidden-camera prank show. The Malaysian government quickly and timidly allowed the North Koreans to go free when the regime effectively held Malaysian embassy staff hostage with their families in Pyongyang. So that left the two vulnerable young women facing a mandatory death penalty for murder, just so the Malaysian legal system could indict someone and save face.It is a gripping story, well told by documentary film-maker Ryan White, with the help of two journalists who covered it at the time: Bloomberg reporter Hadi Azmi and the Washington Post’s former Beijing bureau chief Anna Fifield. There is something genuinely chilling about the way the North Koreans groomed and gaslit their two young victims, making them do dozens of supposed pranks on people over many months, with regular payment and spurious reassurance: eerie dummy-run stunts, just to get them used to the technique.Aisyah and Huong were manipulated like young women being sex-trafficked and, in the strangest, unknowing way, like jihadis being schooled for a big attack. (The nerve-agent element has an extra resonance for the UK after the Russians’ novichok outrage in Salisbury in 2018.) Only the state has access to chemical weapons, and their use is designed to send a sickening message of triumphalism and nationalism.What an extraordinary story of sexism, violence, diplomatic bad faith and dishonesty on an international scale. One question remains: who had the bizarre yet satanically clever idea of a fake prank show? And how is it that the North Koreans, supposedly marooned in their Soviet past, managed to dream up something dripping with contemporary media irony? It could be down to a certain mysterious Japanese national who was identified as an accomplice, but never tracked down. Perhaps a true-crime podcast should now be devoted to finding him. Assassins is available on digital platforms from 29 January."
Tokyo Dragon Chef review – ramen-themed yakuza musical comedy,"Yoshihiro Nishimura throws every ingredient into this overblown, overcooked and oddly endearing underworld romp",3,"Cult Japanese filmmaker Yoshihiro Nishimura, who started off doing special effects before moving into the director’s chair, is best known for pulpy, action-horror fare with self-explanatory titles such as Mutant Girls Squad and Tokyo Gore Police, as well as the more enigmatically monikered Meatball Machine Kodoku.Tokyo Dragon Chef, I’m assuming, lies tonally between the one about gore police and the one about meatball machines given it’s about a pair of ageing yakuza thugs, Ryu (Yasukaze Motomiya) and Tatsu (Yoshiyuki Yamaguchi), who decide to open a ramen restaurant. Their speciality, which does indeed look darn tasty, is a recipe Tatsu honed while doing time and working in the prison’s mess hall, a kind of ma po tofu with ramen.Soon, their tiny venue is drawing rave reviews from YouTubers and a pretty schoolgirl (played by pop star Rinne Yoshida) comes round to sing songs about ramen because – of course – this is also a musical. But then another pair of rival ex-yakuza types (the joke is that all four actors used to play gangsters in straighter films back in the day) start up a food truck business selling ramen across the street. What’s more, they’ve hired a buxom, pink-haired creature in a latex bodysuit (Saiko Yatsuhashi) who may not actually be human and somehow never feels the strain of the enormous quantities of food she can eat.The Japanese dialogue is probably much funnier than the subtitles make it seem, but it’s hard not to suspect that even native speakers might find the film’s concept more amusing than its execution. You have probably seen TikTok videos with more budget than this film. But it’s playful and brisk, and what’s not to love about any movie that has baddies who go around with giant eyeball masks on their heads, just like the immortal experimental punk band the Residents? Tokyo Dragon Chef is available on digital platforms from 25 January."
Penguin Bloom review – Naomi Watts and charming magpies star in heavy-handed film,"Based on a true story about a paraplegic woman who adopted an injured bird, Glendyn Ivin’s film has some wince-worthy lines – and takes the easy way out",2,"Director Glendyn Ivin’s melodrama Penguin Bloom comprises two key plot strands – one involving a human and the other an animal – which have unsubtle intersecting metaphors.While vacationing in Thailand, Sam Bloom (Naomi Watts) falls off a ledge and becomes a paraplegic. Months after the accident, while she is in the throes of deep depression, her husband Cameron (Andrew Lincoln) and their three young boys (Griffin Murray-Johnston, Felix Cameron and Abe Clifford-Barr) bring into the family home an injured magpie they name Penguin, pledging to nurse it back to health. And so: a bird learning to fly again coupled with the story of a wheelchair user whose spirits are broken.Insulating Penguin Bloom a little from complaints that it trades in heavy-handed metaphors is the fact it was based on a true story (adapted from a book by Cameron Bloom and Bradley Trevor Greive). It reminded me of Craig Monahan’s gentle 2014 drama Healing, which was inspired by a real-life initiative that had prisoners working in a sanctuary for injured raptors – thus ripe with symbolism invoking broken wings and broken people.The idea of an animal’s physical and behavioural transformation mirroring a person’s is an interesting and multifaceted concept. Are we for instance projecting ourselves on to animals when we see our stories in them, or are some narrative templates – such as triumphing over adversity – so strong they transcend species, bringing a degree of narrative order to a chaotic universe?It becomes painfully clear early in Penguin Bloom, however, that Ivin – who recently directed two exceptional TV series, The Cry and Safe Harbour – is going to take the easy way out. Even talented directors find it difficult to resist the lure of the voiceover, despite that famous dictum being drilled into their heads since film school: the one about how they ought to “show, don’t tell”.The person doing the telling in Penguin Bloom is Noah (Murray-Johnston), one of Sam and Cameron’s sons, who begins by reminiscing that “Mum loves the ocean, she always has” and eventually concludes that she “is not the person she once was ... but for me, she’s more than that”. How was anybody not wincing when that line was recorded?I quickly found myself longing for less yakety-yak and more visual storytelling – only for another dictum, “careful what you wish for,” to start ringing in my head. In one dramatic scene Sam stares at a jar of honey and pushes it off the kitchen bench, as if to say: my life has been smashed to pieces – a moment so symbolically loaded they put it on the trailer. During another Sam smashes framed family photos with a broomstick, and yes – they put that one on the trailer too.Meanwhile, Penguin stays busy charming the characters and the audience, softening Sam’s hardened heart and embedding herself into the family’s routines – pottering around the home, stealing a teabag from a mug and generally behaving like a loveable little scamp. The way the bird (several were used during production) is integrated into various scenes – as if it really were a member of the family – is exceptionally well done: props to magpie trainer Paul Mander, who was assisted with modestly used and seamlessly integrated CGI.When Penguin finds herself in a traumatic situation, I discovered myself more emotionally involved than I thought, genuinely concerned for her safety – well aware that Australian cinema has a reputation for killing off animals (particularly dogs: Mad Max 2, Red Dog, Snowtown, I’m looking at you). I felt more invested in Sam’s journey in the second half too, when she takes up kayaking and Watts’ strong, solemn performance is afforded more space to breathe.But every once in a while Ivin did something to make me question his motives. Take for example a shot late in the piece, in which Sam looks ahead and imagines herself – smiling, upright and walking happily – beaming back at her. This image comes dangerously close to endorsing outdated and offensive views of disability: particularly the idea that a person isn’t “complete” unless they look and move like the majority.By this point shouldn’t the film be more interested in the person Sam has become, rather than who she once was? A postscript informs us that Bloom went on to achieve numerous sporting distinctions, as if this were nothing more than a small thing to bung on at the end. It is a final confirmation that Penguin Bloom, while heartening, is more about loss than rebirth. There is a great, moving story to tell about the real Sam Bloom – but this film only gets part of the way there. Penguin Bloom is in Australian cinemas now"
"Quo Vadis, Aida? review – shattering return to Srebrenica","Through the eyes of a translator moving between the different ethnic factions, director Jasmila Žbanić musters real tragic power and clear-eyed compassion revisiting the massacre 25 years on ",5,"There’s a real tragic power in this almost unbearably brutal and shocking movie from writer-director Jasmila Žbanić about the Srebrenica massacre in 1995 during the Bosnian war, in which more than 8,000 unarmed Bosnian Muslims sheltering in a so-called UN “safe area” were slaughtered: the biggest civilian atrocity in Europe since the second world war. Dutch UN peacekeeping soldiers in powder-blue helmets had been unable to stop Bosnian Serb forces swaggering into their compound – undisciplined, jacked up with the brutal thrill of conquest, paranoid about combatants supposedly hiding among the civilian refugees and simply seething with ethnic hate.Jasna Đuričić plays Aida, a schoolteacher-turned-translator who is employed by the UN to interpret in discussions between Bosnian Muslim leaders and UN officials, as Srebrenica falls to the Serb forces. Her husband Nihad (Izudin Bajrović) is a headteacher, and they sense that their military-age sons Hamdija (Boris Ler) and Sejo (Dino Bajrović) are now in great danger of reprisals from the victorious Serb army. As they huddle in the disused battery factory under the UN’s supposed protection with thousands of other terrified souls, and thousands more outside, with chaos, squalor and panic growing, Aida scurries around frantically trying to get information. She realises that the pathetic UN commander Karremans (Johan Heldenbergh) can do nothing in the face of the murderous bullies led by the notorious war criminal Ratko Mladić, played with horribly plausible conceit and disdain by Boris Isaković, smoothly and ambiguously announcing his determination not to hurt “innocent” people and handing out Toblerone bars to the trembling children.As an interpreter, Aida is effectively the drama’s liaison or intermediary between the different constituencies: with her licence to roam, she can take the audience to the Serbs, to the Dutch UN officers and to the civilians. The camera is often running behind Aida as she desperately goes around, demanding that the UN do something or at least protect her family. Đuričić’s face is agonisingly etched with her own horror and disbelief; she seems to age 20 years in the course of the drama.There is an extraordinary moment when, amid all the fear and boredom and cramped conditions, she sees two young people kissing and she starts laughing – overwhelmed, perhaps, at this evidence that life and humanity goes on, or perhaps at the glorious but vulnerable innocence of youth. Maybe the kissing couple think that everything will be all right, and a flashback gives us Aida’s own youth, taking part in a boozy “beauty contest” in a bar, in the days when Serbs, Muslims and Croats were still friends and neighbours. There are wrenching moments when Aida recognises former pupils of hers now in Serb uniform, pushing her around at gunpoint.A previous film of Žbanić’s, Esma’s Secret: Grbavica, with a similar Bosnian theme, won the Golden Bear in Berlin in 2006, though I was less convinced. But her latest film seemed to me an icily brilliant and overwhelmingly convincing attempt to tackle, head-on, this shameful atrocity: shameful for the UN, the European Union and all those western world leaders who had been reluctant to intervene – perhaps because the totemic word “Sarajevo” made them fear a new world war. Perhaps also in their hearts they thought military intervention was all very well in the Middle East but not in Europe.At any rate, the Srebrenica massacre arguably galvanised Nato forces against Mladic. As for the title, it’s taken from the apocryphal Christian tradition that Peter met the risen Christ outside Rome and asked him: “Quo vadis?” – “Whither goest thou?” – and the answer was: to Rome, to be crucified again. Aida herself is crucified twice, once during the massacre and again afterwards, as she begins to recognise certain people in the community she has rejoined. After 25 years, the time has come to look again at the horror of Srebrenica, and Zbanic has done this with clear-eyed compassion and candour. Quo Vadis, Aida? is available on Curzon Home Cinema from 22 January."
The Rental review – predictable cabin-in-the-woods scares,"Dan Stevens and Alison Brie star in this horror-mystery, which has a nicely tense setup but degenerates into cliche",2,"Initial high hopes are dashed at the third-act stage of this disappointing cabin-in-the-woods horror-mystery in which actor Dave Franco (brother of James) makes his directorial debut, co-writing with mumblecore film-maker Joe Swanberg.Two couples rent an ocean-front beach house for a luxury weekend getaway: tech entrepreneur Charlie (Dan Stevens) and his partner Michelle (Alison Brie), with Charlie’s brother, Josh (Jeremy Allen White), and Josh’s partner, Mina (Sheila Vand), who is also the co-owner of Charlie’s tech startup. When the foursome arrives, they are instantly nettled by the guy showing them around the property: Taylor (Toby Huss) makes casually racist comments about Mina. And it turns out their ultra-fancy rental has some very strange things about it. Are they being spied on?The dynamic between the four characters is interesting at first, in part because there is already some difficult sexual and social tension between them; it isn’t just the weirdo place they find themselves in. But when the gory/scary stuff really starts happening, the film suddenly loses its dramatic charge. The focus is muddled and uncertain. When tough guy Josh (who we learn has already done jail time for violence) starts taking action against someone who might not actually have done anything wrong, the film starts becoming more of a suspense thriller in which our four hapless heroes have to cover up their own misdeeds. It almost seems as if they themselves are the bad guys, which undermines the potency and the dramatic point of the threat that emerges from the darkness.It’s pretty basic boilerplate, scary-movie stuff, with tropes and tricks that have already been extensively satirised elsewhere. The Rental is available on Amazon Prime Video from 22 January."
Stardust review – David Bowie biopic is an odd-couple oddity,Bowie’s 1971 trip to the US – the inspiration for his Ziggy Stardust persona – is reimagined as a comedy road trip with his hopelessly uncool publicist,2,"The very talented actor and musician Johnny Flynn here makes a perfectly game attempt to impersonate the young David Bowie in this ironised and fictionalised account of Bowie’s 1971 US publicity tour which – partly – inspired his Ziggy Stardust persona. Flynn carries off Bowie’s clothes and delicate mannerisms plausibly enough and, impressively, he does his own singing. But, all too often, this Bowie looks as if he is presenting TV’s Bake Off.Bowie arrived at Washington DC’s Dulles airport where an immigration official called him a “fag”, and where Mercury Records publicity man Ron Oberman (played here by comic Marc Maron) arrived to meet him, having got a lift to the airport from his mum and dad, and took the bemused Bowie back for a home-cooked family meal, like a 13-year-old foreign exchange student. The movie shows this, but where in reality the tour saw Bowie fly to major cities, meeting with Oberman a few times and doing interviews, the movie escalates this to a huge comedy-odd-couple road trip. Oberman and Bowie head across the country in Ron’s uncool, un-rock’n’roll station wagon, with Bowie playing disastrous, low-key gigs and Ron becoming a Spinal Tap-type PR goof who is mortified at the poor turnout.Meanwhile, back in London, Jena Malone plays the heavily pregnant Angie Bowie, who comes across as a charmlessly shrill and bad-tempered scold, and David is having traumatised flashback memories of his troubled brother Terry (Derek Moran). The movie makes a laboured connection between Terry’s mental illness and David’s dark imaginings, a connection that surely comes close to misunderstanding the nature of schizophrenia. And so the tour goes on, and Bowie providentially hears (or hears about) the music of Iggy Pop and cult psychobilly star Legendary Stardust Cowboy, which fed into the Ziggy Stardust creation.This is a strained, frustrating concoction that doesn’t do its subject justice. Flynn really can sing, though. Stardust is available from 15 January on digital platforms."
Dear Comrades! review – stunning re-creation of a Soviet-era massacre,Andrei Konchalovsky’s account of the day Red Army soldiers and KGB snipers opened fire on strikers is a rage-filled triumph,5,"Anger burns a hole through the screen in this stark monochrome picture from veteran director Andrei Konchalovsky: a gruelling re-enactment of the hushed-up Novocherkassk massacre in western Russia in 1962, when Red Army soldiers and KGB snipers opened fire on unarmed striking workers, killing an estimated 80 people. It was a day of spiritual nausea for the Soviet Union, which had only just entered Khrushchev’s new de-Stalinised era of supposed enlightenment – a postwar civilian bloodbath that was the Soviets’ Sharpeville, or Kent State, or Bloody Sunday, or indeed the Corpus Christi massacre in Mexico City that featured in Alfonso Cuarón’s Roma.Yuliya Vysotskaya – a longtime Konchalovsky player – plays Lyuda, a Communist party official and single mother who lives in a tiny flat in Novocherkassk with her 18-year-old daughter Svetka (Yuliya Burova) and grizzled old dad (Sergei Erlish). There are terrible food shortages, yet Lyuda is a loyal and uncomplaining party member who not so secretly pines for the good old days of Josef Stalin, when the Soviet Union was bathed in glorious wartime destiny and when things seemed to be better all round. Now she is having a furtive affair with a cynical and bleary married committee official who doesn’t even seem to like her very much.To the party’s uncomprehending disgust, a strike is triggered by exhausted workers’ rage at the sudden issue of lowered wages and food price rises and the party’s fatuous claim that this lethal combination will ease pressure on state finances and, therefore, create more plenty in the long term. There is horrifying chaos and slaughter: Svetka goes missing, and Lyuda embarks on a desperate quest to find her, dead or alive. What’s worse is that she has a party-loyalist reputation for endorsing precisely this kind of cruel crackdown and must suppress her secret anguish about her missing daughter and give an address to the party faithful beginning with the greeting: “Dorogie tovarishi!” (“Dear comrades!”)Konchalovsky clearly shows the incompetence, paranoia, bureaucracy and secrecy that created this mass murder. I found myself thinking about Craig Mazin’s recent TV drama Chernobyl. The same instincts are on display: to shut down the city, to cover everything up, smother everything and fail to understand. There is here an intense regional dislike of Novocherkassk and the whole area as the home of the untameable Cossacks and peasants. Lyuda’s father has grim memories of retributive local killings, and he reflects grimly on Mikhail Sholokhov’s And Quiet Flows the Don and its bitter vision.So much of the film’s pain is in that single word: comrade. (Lyuda keeps finding herself singing a rousing patriotic song from the movie that’s just been on TV: Grigory Alekandrov’s Spring, with its earnest chorus of, “Oh comrades, protect your motherland at all costs!”) The word denotes equality and brotherhood and anti-hierarchical idealism that does away with caste and class. In fact, the word functions as a sentimental kind of denial about the vertical structure of power everywhere, with everyone afraid of people above them – but also people below, who could snitch, or suddenly be promoted over them. There is a chilling moment after the massacre when a bewildered young woman is curtly told to sign an official document confirming that she will never reveal to anyone what has happened, but is then taken away, apparently to be executed, when the KGB official decides her behaviour at their brief interview has been unsatisfactory. This woman’s fate is, however, even stranger and scarier than we think.So the drama continues with officialdom blandly declaring that there will be a party with dancing that evening at 7pm, apparently to expunge any ill feeling, and also, given that the blood cannot be washed away from the asphalt and has somehow baked redly into it, a new layer of asphalt must be placed over it. On top of all this, Konchalovsky places an unexpected ending with its layer of bleak irony; it is a passionate drama of fear and rage. Dear Comrades! is on Curzon Home Cinema from 15 January."
MLK/FBI review – startling study of the war against Martin Luther King,"This documentary throws the bureau’s appalling dirty-tricks campaign into sharp focus but is frustratingly reticent on other, more contentious issues",3,"The FBI’s secret campaign of bugging, harassment and defamation against Martin Luther King Jr in the 60s is the subject of this startling but sometimes frustratingly reticent and guarded documentary. This poisonous dirty-tricks campaign continued until King’s assassination in Memphis in 1968, a murder that the bureau was somehow unable to prevent, despite its fanatical round-the-clock surveillance of King as well as its loudly proclaimed dedication to crimefighting.It is now a matter of record that King was a flawed human being and had extramarital sex, but this is an enduringly mysterious part of his public image. (Even Ava DuVernay’s very fine biopic account of King in her 2014 movie Selma, starring David Oyelowo, tactfully romanticises these indiscretions.) The bureau’s audio tapes of alleged meetings in hotel rooms were finally, in 1977, handed over to the National Archives by order of a federal judge but sealed – they cannot be released until 2027 at the earliest. What exactly will they prove? Anything at all? All we have right now are the typescripts of the agents’ highly subjective summary reports.This film from Sam Pollard, based largely on the work of Pulitzer-winning historian David J Garrow, shows how bizarrely toxic and dysfunctional the FBI’s campaign was, an ongoing secret war that involved running informants within the civil rights movement – a painful and even tragic aspect of this history that probably deserves a documentary of its own. Bureau director J Edgar Hoover was incensed by King’s leftist associations, and by his international celebrity, especially after he was awarded the Nobel peace prize in 1964. After chancing on evidence of his adultery, Hoover hoped to use this to undermine him, and with extraordinary spite circulated the tapes to King’s wife Coretta and even to church leaders and the press, apparently hoping (in vain) that someone would go public.There was even a suggestion that King was present at a rape – and this film, very gingerly indeed, comes close to hinting that there might one day be a #MeToo case to answer. But wait. Where is the proof here? Where is the naming of names? Surely the bureau, with all the dark powers at its command, could have induced one of King’s alleged mistresses to come forward and go public? Apparently not. It is a question that this film does not fully address, although it certainly gives us a queasily detailed picture of Hoover’s pure paranoid nastiness. MLK/FBI is on digital platforms from 15 January."
Archive review – anyone for a posthuman wife? She comes with an off switch,"A lonely computer scientist in the year 2038 secretly works on an android version of his wife who died in a car crash – is it romantic, or something more sinister?",3,"British illustrator and visual-effects director Gavin Rothery makes his feature debut with this artificial intelligence thriller: a tale of love, death and robotics that has some nicely creepy moments. Set in 2038, it centres on lonely computer scientist George Almore (Divergent’s Theo James), who is holed up in a remote research facility in Japan secretly working on an android version of his wife Jules (Stacy Martin); she has died in a car crash. His prototype, J3 (also played by Martin), is his closest yet to the real thing: a highly advanced humanoid with spookily pale skin who looks like she might be the ghost of his dead wife. Poor old J1 and J2, his earlier, clunkier prototypes: they look on bitterly as the newer, sleeker model gets all George’s attention.The movie opens with sweeping helicopter shots over a snowy forest. Inside the concrete bunker-like facility, Rothery works wonders with a modest budget (he was behind the look of Duncan Jones’s Moon), creating an ungimmicky nearish future that looks a lot like today. When George’s corporate bosses threaten to pull the plug on his research, he hurries to put the finishing touches to J3 – a task involving the contents of a fridge-like archive unit containing his dead wife’s consciousness. George is surrounded by the robot versions of Jules. J1 is boxy, non-verbal and baby-like. J2 is a little more advanced: she can speak, and behaves like a teenager, huffing jealously when George removes her legs to give to J3.In the end, George is playing God – creating a woman not from a rib but electrical components and computer programming. The script’s take on this is romantic: here is a man who’ll do whatever it takes to be reunited with his wife. I couldn’t help finding it a bit more sinister; when J2 misbehaves, George orders her back to her docking station. He is in control. (Anyone for a posthuman wife? She comes with an off switch.) And the final ta-da revelation felt a bit contrived. Still, Archive is refreshingly non-cerebral – and that’s a compliment. It’s a sci-fi movie that wants to entertain, not deliver a lecture on AI. On digital formats from 18 January."
Ham on Rye review – subversive satire on suburban conformity,There’s a whole other layer beneath first-time director Tyler Taormina’s apparently realist coming-of-age drama,4,"First-time feature director Tyler Taormina has dreamed his way into a very strange and intriguing film: a Gen-Z reverie about life and fate, somewhere between The Prom and The Purge. The film never behaves as if it is anything other than a realist coming-of-age drama but there is something else going on.Haley (Haley Bodell) is part of a clique of popular high-school kids in a bland suburban town who are preparing to take part in a local tradition. She and some other girls are wearing floaty dresses of sacrificial white and getting ready to go down to a local deli called Monty’s – along with a whole crowd of other kids – for what seems to be a pairing-off ritual, like a dance without music or dancing. But there is a lot riding on this, and Haley can’t persuade herself that she wants to join in.Ham on Rye is a satirical parable on conformism and aspiration, and it speaks to anyone who, in settled adulthood, looks back to when their life and romantic chances were arbitrarily decided by a few events in their teens and early 20s. And there’s another layer, too. Ham on Rye takes a bleakly subversive look at the whole idea of breaking free of your boring suburban home town and making it in the glamorous adult world beyond. This is the theme of so many films, and perhaps it is the overriding theme of Hollywood itself. So many films succumb to the romantic fantasy that the way to do this is to be a rebel, a free-thinker, a defier-of-norms.Yet this film, in its surreal way, is grimly about something closer to the un-surreal truth: the people who got out of their boring, philistine home towns were overwhelmingly the competent conformists, at least outwardly and temporarily. They were the ones who worked hard, got good grades and went far away to college, where their individuality could at last flourish. Taormina’s meditation on all this could be compared to Yorgos Lanthimos or Gus Van Sant, but it is very individual work, as creepy as a ghost story. Ham on Rye is available on Mubi from 11 January."
The Snow Queen review – whirl through Scarborough's winter wonderland,Available online Polly Lister plays umpteen parts in this spirited Hans Christian Andersen adaptation filmed at Stephen Joseph theatre,3,"A couple of Christmases ago, in Theresa Heskins’ production of The Worst Witch, Polly Lister doubled the roles of headteacher Miss Cackle and her villainous twin Agatha. In the most giddily enjoyable scene, she wore both outfits at once and switched between the parts at lightning speed as the sisters battled it out.At Scarborough’s Stephen Joseph theatre, Lister goes several steps further in The Snow Queen, Nick Lane’s new adaptation of the Hans Christian Andersen fairytale. With the sort of sugar rush you get from wolfing several days’ worth of a chocolate advent calendar, Lister juggles the roles of another pair of good and bad sisters, the Sun Sorceress and the Snow Queen. But she also plays best friends Gerda and Kai; a cigar-chewing granny who flirts with the audience like a panto dame; a scooter-riding reindeer; and a raven who specialises in scatological verse. Fancy hearing a bit of “pooetry”? You’re in luck: Black Drop envisions a vista of bird droppings falling from the sky like snow.Lister is a one-woman whirlwind, even if this spirited 90-minute production – filmed before a socially distanced audience – begins to run out of steam. Gerda and Kai, who are also represented by solemn-faced puppets, are not the sparkiest of heroes and their to-the-end-of-the-world friendship never quite convinces. The relationship between the two sisters is similarly thin.There is plenty of witty wordplay and a scattering of local references in Paul Robinson’s production, as the Snow Queen hatches her plan to put Santa out of business by moving the names of all the nice children on to his naughty list. Lane’s script nods at the challenge of feeling festive amid a pandemic, with its vision of the “Other Scarborough” and an emphasis on daydreaming and the magic of imagination.Paul Stear’s lighting provides atmospheric shifts between the seasons on Helen Coyston’s attractive set, with its garden design decorated with snail-like squirl patterns, a cupboard hiding a hedgehog DJ, and a chorus of flowers who become backing singers for Simon Slater’s songs.Even if you’ve taken down your own decorations, it all adds up to a welcome burst of festive fun. And with schools closed and weeks of lockdown to weather, who wouldn’t want Christmas to last a bit longer this year?Available online until 31 January."
Vanguard review – Jackie Chan reunites with Stanley Tong for patriotic action comedy,Chan pulls a few martial arts moves as the elder statesman of an elite security firm working to rescue a Chinese accountant and his wife from kidnappers,2,"Veteran Hong Kong action director Stanley Tong reunites with his longtime star Jackie Chan for this amiable but rather under-par adventure with silly CGI effects. Chan is allowed one or two comedy moments, but takes a very straight and stately role as Tang, the “elder statesman”-type director of an elite private security firm called Vanguard, presiding over tough, battle-ready and apparently also catwalk-ready young people – and occasionally pulling a few martial arts moves. In his trim three-piece suit and glasses, however, he looks faintly like Ronnie Corbett.A Chinese accountant and his young wife are kidnapped in London’s Chinatown and Vanguard (with its preposterous HQ full of people wearing phone headsets and gazing at computer screens) is tasked with rescuing him, his wife and his winsome daughter, who is doing laudable conservation work in a nation state referred to initially as “Africa”. She is also vulnerable to abduction as she frolics with CGI big cats in Lion King world. Tang and his crew toughly resolve to rescue their man, while frowning at his supposedly unwitting links with arms dealers, the source of all his woes.Their adventure takes them all over the world, from London (where Chinatown and Buckingham Palace are apparently adjacent) to a fictional land that looks vaguely like Zambia and then to the ineffably boring but wealthy world of Dubai. The scene with a jetski on the edge of a waterfall deserves points, but this feels disposable: the Chinese New Year is earnestly referenced as part of the film’s strident and faintly humourless patriotism. Vanguard is in cinemas and on digital formats from 8 January."
The White Tiger review – Balzac-worthy satire of submission and power,This adaptation of Aravind Adiga’s Booker-winning novel about aspiration in modern India is teeming with energy and sadness,4,"The White Tiger is a story of servitude, resentment and love – and what its hero calls “the contented smile that comes to the lips of a servant who has done his duty by his master”. He does a lot of smiling in this film, but this is about something other than contentment. It is a professional reflex and a personal holding pattern, a blank grin kept in place while the servant decides if he in fact hates his master, and while he also decides if he might somehow one day be the master himself. It is an ambiguous smile, which causes him to wonder if he hates the master behind a facade of loving, or loves this role-model behind a facade of hating. And this desperate aspirational cunning and survival-struggle is happening in India, which is shown to have the same ambiguously submissive attitude to the globalised employer forces of China, Britain and the United States, who all want India’s cheap labour for their outsourcing.The drama is adapted by film-maker Ramin Bahrani from the 2008 bestseller and Booker prize winner by Aravind Adiga, and Bahrani also directs with terrific storytelling energy. It is powered by satirical pessimism about a feudal-gangster system depicted as alive and well in 21st-century India – thriving in parallel with the cynical exploitation and arrogance of other countries. Bahrani finds in this story the same battle with poverty that he gave us in Man Push Cart (2005) and a toxic mentor-mentee bromance to compare with his 99 Homes (2014), in which the hero also finds himself working for the people who humiliated his family.Adarsh Gourav gives a tremendous performance as Balram, a likely lad from a dirt-poor village who once deeply impressed his teachers with his academic flair – as rare as a white tiger. But his family’s catastrophic collapse into poverty meant that his schooling had to be abandoned, and grownup Balram is watchfully aware of the wealthy landlord family presiding over his wretchedness, grasping at their rent even though they are already rich through exporting coal. There is the hatchet-faced patriarch nicknamed the Stork (played by director and actor Mahesh Manjrekar), and the Mongoose (Vijay Maurya), his boorish elder son. But there is also the more liberal, tolerant younger son Ashok (Rajkummar Rao), who is just back from the US with his Indian-American wife Pinky (Priyanka Chopra). Ruthlessly ambitious Balram makes it his business to grovel strategically to this overlord family and soon gets a job as personal driver to Ashok and Pinky, humbly living in the dank subterranean level of their luxury Delhi apartment block and being treated kindly by this modern-minded, Americanised young couple, who pride themselves on being nice to the staff – up to a point. But a terrible accident brings their relationship, and Balram’s secret self-hate, to a crisis.The White Tiger is a dangerous adventure of self-betterment from the teeming city streets, influenced by Adiga’s own avowed love of Dickens and Balzac, and it’s a really enjoyable story, though not without flaws. I could have done without Balram introducing himself through the hackneyed 90s device of the freeze-frame/voiceover, bringing us into his story at its highest moment of car-crash drama and tragedy – everything but a needle-scratch into silence. It makes for a slightly misjudged moment of irony. And it is arguably unconvincing that, having shown us how the ruling classes can get away with murder because the lower-caste victims are all disposably alike, the film suggests that servants could also get away with it because they are all indistinguishable. It can’t be as easy as that.But I liked Balram’s epiphany that the servant’s real relief is not to dream that he has killed his master and then wake to find that he hasn’t, but to dream that he has timidly failed to murder his master and then wake in riches to find, once again, that he has.The idea of family is behind it all. Balram’s own family are of no actual help. Balram will often claim that Ashok and Pinky are his true family and for all that this is a gruesome perversion of the truth, this fatcat clan often does not seem to be much more callous and indifferent than Balram’s own kin. Tellingly, Balram shows no great interest in getting married: whatever romantic energies he has are entirely subsumed into his need to submit, parasitically, to his employer. An absorbing tale of feline ambition. The White Tiger is on Netflix on 22 January."
We Can Be Heroes review – nutrient-free tween superhero caper,These Gen Z school-age superheroes don’t buck the downward trajectory of director Robert Rodriguez’s recent work for kids,2,"For his children’s films, Robert Rodriguez long ago established his own style in strip-cartoon type graphics, garish colour schemes and affordable digital effects – notably with the genuinely likable and now almost 20-year-old gem, Spy Kids, which starred Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino. But since then, his line in family movies has felt visually wearing, hectoring and pretty flat, without much in the way of a funny script. This new one pops thinly like day-old bubblegum, with the same lack of anything satisfying or nutritious.It is a sequel to his entirely disposable 2005 kids’ film The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D, which felt like he had knocked it out in a month in his edit suite. This follow-up isn’t quite as insufferable, but it has the same tendency to confuse hyperactivity with energy, and that reference to David Bowie in the title is not earned, unless we’re talking about turning into a type of chocolate assortment.Taylor Dooley returns as Lavagirl, but Taylor Lautner, the original Sharkboy, was apparently not available for this movie, so his character is now behind a mask. These characters are only cameos anyway. Now it is all about the new tween generation, the wacky, moody kids of the superheroes, particularly Missy Moreno (YaYa Gosselin), who is the daughter of Marcus Moreno (The Mandolarian’s Pedro Pascal – also appearing as a supervillain in Patty Jenkins’ Wonder Woman 1984). She and a bunch of other Gen Z contemporaries find themselves cooped up in a creche-style school classroom in the grownup superheroes’ HQ, presided over by the stern Ms Granada (Priyanka Chopra) until they realise they have to save the world against an alien invasion.This is pretty ho-hum stuff, but it could keep very young kids quiet over a lockdown Christmas. We Can Be Heroes is released on 25 December on Netflix."
Coolie No 1 review – David Dhawan's comedy remake is bigger but not better,"Dhawan casts his son Varun in the role made famous in 1995 by Govinda, but little effort has been made to acknowledge the quarter-century since",2,"It’s a tale of two Bollywoods this Christmas. Over at Netflix, Anurag Kashyap and Vikramaditya Motwane, representing Indian film’s modernising wing, have engineered the sharp and knowing meta-thriller AK vs AK. Here on Amazon Prime Video meanwhile, you can watch veteran comedy director David Dhawan renew his IP rights on Coolie No 1, previously a hit 1995 vehicle for the Sandwell-born funnyman Govinda. Even the latter’s most devout fans would probably concede the original left room for improvements, but that’s something Dhawan appears unfussed about. This Coolie updates a few reference points and replaces Govinda with latter-day hunk Varun Dhawan – the director’s son – then surrounds him with antiquated players and playing, part of a frenetic attempt to pretend the last 30 years never happened.The plot – lowly railway porter (Dhawan) is hired to woo a society belle (Sara Ali Khan) as part of a conspiracy to disgrace her family – remains familiar and predictable. The most immediate contrast with the original is a result of the casting. Rather too obviously a handsome, cardio-trained leading man schlubbing down for (not many) easy laughs, Dhawan Jr bounds onscreen with boyish enthusiasm, but trails a lingering note of condescension – and Dhawan Sr was evidently too busy remembering how best to smash his supporting actors in the gonads to direct anyone. Khan, sadly, is stranded on balconies looking fetchingly concerned while the men below determine her character’s destiny. In this, Coolie 2020 really does seem so last century.The well-populated songbreaks – which retain more life and colour than the jokes – reveal this a bigger film than its predecessor. Dhawan now has access to sunnier locations and more expensive hotels; the aim is clearly to give those of us in the cheap seats a sniff of the high life. But with the material as thin as ever, this version seems even emptier: it goes in one ear, and vaporises before it can emerge from the other. In 1995, and in the absence of more pressing entertainment options, such candyfloss might have passed two hours mindlessly enough. In 2020, this means it will almost certainly be the streaming premiere most likely to go unfinished this season – and competition for that sorry distinction has been fierce.Released on Amazon Prime Video on 25 December."
AK vs AK review – ingenious meta-feud of Bollywood heavyweights,Anurag Kashyap kidnaps the daughter of Anil Kapoor in a mock-doc thriller that skewers India’s showbiz scene,4,"After an undistinguished pandemic year, Indian cinema closes out 2020 with a postmodern surprise, at once nifty and nasty. Shot under the radar, and announced mere days ago, Vikramaditya Motwane’s mock-doc proposes a seismic smackdown between two industry figureheads. In one corner, Anil Kapoor, cuddly patriarch of one of Bollywood’s most illustrious clans. In the other, Anurag Kashyap, film-maker and longtime critic of movie nepotism, going a fiendish extra mile here by kidnapping Anil’s daughter and giving dad 10 hours to find her. Kashyap, by orchestrating this round of meta hide-and-seek, intends to generate “the most dangerous hostage thriller in the history of cinema” – spoken like a true showman.Bollywood postmodernism is nothing new: Shah Rukh Khan stalked himself through the ultra-knowing Fan four years ago. What Kashyap and Motwane bring to the genre, assisted by Netflix’s hands-off approach to censorship, is a sharper edge. Motwane and co-writer Avinash Sampath slyly reference Taken, but a closer narrative precedent would be 1996’s The Fan, with Kashyap in the De Niro role of marginalised malcontent and his schemes updated for an image-saturated age. At one point Kapoor dashes into a police station, which rapidly fills up with officers keener to snap selfies with the actor than hear his complaint; when they do, it’s met with applause – the assumption being that their hero is rehearsing a monologue.As a director, Kashyap’s experiments in freshening up the Hindi mainstream have met variable success but here, with Motwane calling the shots, the provocation works. As a thriller, it scarcely lets up and provides no easy out: Kapoor continually has to hurdle his own public persona and his tormentors home in on the cracks forming in his “Mr India” facade. It’s a little inside-baseball, maybe – the more you know these men’s careers, the more you’ll enjoy it – and neither AK manages to address the role of women in this industry tussle, save as pawns in a boys’ game.Still, this is your one chance this Christmas to see a major star and director going at one another’s throats – and a timely reminder that Indian cinema remains capable of venturing grippingly off-piste.Released on 24 December on Netflix."
One Night in Miami review – high-concept quartet of 1960s African American icons,"Cassius Clay, Malcolm X, Sam Cooke and NFL star Jim Brown ring in the changes in a Florida motel room in Regina King’s spirited film",3,"One Night in Miami is a fluent, high-minded, if sometimes slightly inert movie, with an invigorating interest in ideas and debate – and it begins with a brutally effective sucker-punch of racism from the Jim Crow/antebellum world. Regina King directs with flair, working from the script that Kemp Powers (co-director of Pixar’s Soul) has adapted from his own stage play. This is a Stoppardian high-concept display, imagining the conversation of four legendary African Americans who really did come together in Miami in 1964 after the boxing victory of Cassius Clay (as he then was) over Sonny Liston. The world is about to change, and they are ringside.Eli Goree plays Clay, euphoric and slightly terrified by his own emerging greatness; Kingsley Ben-Adir is Malcolm X, keen to nail down Clay’s private promises to convert to Islam; Aldis Hodge is Jim Brown, the NFL megastar thinking of going into the movies; and Leslie Odom Jr is soul singer Sam Cooke, under fire for going along with the white music establishment. The movie puts them all in the same motel room – Malcolm X’s – and this is to be, to quote the Hamilton musical, the room where it happens; or at any rate, where what’s going to happen gets talked about. (Without comment, King lets us absorb the faint echo of the Lorraine motel in Memphis, Tennessee, where Martin Luther King Jr was assassinated in 1968.) Meanwhile, wives and children get distractedly phoned up, but women themselves are absent from the action and debate.Chiefly at stake is the world of Malcolm X, about to break away and start his own organisation, and so tensely aware that claiming Clay as a prestige convert would be of enormous help. Clay is suddenly unsure if abandoning all that delicious secular pleasure is what he wants to do. Brown feels sports have got him just as far as they’re going to, and that maybe he can cash in his celebrity capital and transfer it to the movies. Cooke angrily defends his own career, proclaiming the real black power of his lucrative music publishing empire.One exchange between Malcolm X and Sam Cooke rang a little false for me. Cooke has just told them how the Rolling Stones have covered a tune written by his contracted protege Bobby Womack: It’s All Over Now, doing far better with it than any black star. Then Malcolm X tauntingly asks him how it is that Bob Dylan can make the kind of chart-topping protest music that black people should be doing. Well, the obvious answer is – because Dylan is white. Hasn’t Cooke already explained this? Hasn’t he given him the example of Bobby Womack and the Rolling Stones recording the same song? But Cooke and the movie itself are weirdly reluctant to spell it out, perhaps because Dylan is another icon-ally on the right side of history. At any rate, it’s an engaging and spirited piece of work. One Night in Miami is released in cinemas on 26 December, and on 15 January on Amazon Prime Video."
The Woman Who Ran review – a movie-novella with a sensational meaning,"Hong Sang-soo’s nuanced, low-key film could be a criticism of Korean sexual politics, or just a series of different meetings ",4,"The cinema of Korean director Hong Sang-soo is seductively low-key and lo-fi, and his latest is a movie-novella in three encounters. It’s so downbeat, so matter-of-fact, that the registers and nuances are almost beneath the radar of what generally constitutes filmic effect. This really is just people talking, and though they sometimes raise their voices, get angry, embarrassed, or upset, a keynote of polite calm soon reasserts itself. Hong’s camera sedately records each exchange from an undramatic distance, sometimes zooming in for something closer midway through the conversation, but not for any pointed reason. Watching this film means recalibrating your expectations so you can gauge the subtleties and absorb the sotto voce implications about relationships and sexual politics. Pretty much all the way through, nothing very sensational seems to be happening. And yet the movie’s sensational meaning is hiding in plain sight: in the title.Gam-hee is a young woman in Seoul who is a florist by trade, though no great importance is attached to that. She is played by Kim Min-hee, the director’s partner and longtime collaborator, who has acted in seven of his last eight films – but is probably best-known for starring in Park Chan-wook’s 2016 film The Handmaiden, based on Sarah Waters’s novel Fingersmith. Gam-hee has been married for five years, during which time, we learn, she has never been apart from her husband for even a single day. She is at some pains to tell people that she has been fine with this. She says things like: “We manage to have good moments every day”; and “I feel a little love every day and that’s enough.” But now her husband has gone off on a business trip so she is going around visiting some old friends, which evidently hadn’t been possible before.Gam-hee encounters three women in three sections. Young-soon (Seo Young-hwa) is a gentle, sweet-natured and slightly dowdy woman who is now divorced and lives in the countryside outside Seoul raising chickens: the woman next door, to whom the title may or may not allude, has run away, leaving a distraught daughter roaming disturbingly around like a ghost. Next is Su-young (Song Seon-mi), a pilates instructor in the city: she has a crush on a neighbour, but is also being stalked by a young poet, with whom she had a rash one-night-stand. Thirdly, there is Woo-jin (Kim Sae-byuk), who is imagined to be the manager of Seoul’s (real-life) Emu cinema and arts centre. She is a slightly spiky character.The first two encounters are planned but this third meeting, in the cinema’s cafe, is very much accidental: Gam-hee tells Woo-jin that she is here to see a film, but this is clearly a fib. In each case, the female conversation is interrupted, or disrupted, by a man. Young-soon’s neighbour pompously asks her to stop feeding stray cats because his wife has a fear of cats and so can’t leave their apartment. But could this woman’s agoraphobia be connected with her overbearing husband, not the cats? Su-young’s former lover rings on the doorbell and harangues her while she’s trying to tell Gam-hee all about her agreeable flirtation with an older, distinguished man. And after talking to Woo-jin at the arts centre cafe, Gam-hee has a very tense but revealing conversation with a famous novelist and TV personality who is there to give a sold-out reading: Gam-hee was dating this man before she got married.When Gam-hee finally meets her old lover, she can’t help giving him a shrill piece of advice: when he’s on TV, which is a lot, he talks too much. Gam-hee is irritated by his volubility, a symptom of her dismay at his public visibility; he keeps on popping up, gabbling away, while she is trying to concentrate on her new life with her husband. And yet there is every sign that this former relationship with a not-yet-celebrity was no better than the new one.Hong just places these three situations in front of us: muddled, messy, happy-sad. “None of them seems like a crisis, and neither does Gam-hee’s own life. But she might want to run, all the same. The Woman Who Ran is released on 20 December on Mubi."
Wonder Woman 1984 review – queenly Gal Gadot disarms the competition,"Gadot is terrifically imposing, while Kristen Wiig is the scene-stealing antagonist in Patty Jenkins’ epically brash sequel",3,"Here is an enjoyable Amazonian incursion into Reagan’s America – but the real wonder is Kristen Wiig, playing the warrior queen’s resentful and emotionally wounded antagonist, Barbara Minerva.It is 1984, that pre-Covid utopian era of big hair, rolled-up jacket sleeves and imminent nuclear war, and Diana of Themyscira is getting her second superheroic adventure in a world dominated by over-promoted mortal males. When we saw this mythical warrior queen in 2017’s Wonder Woman – played as here by Gal Gadot, and with outrageously gorgeous outfits – she had just surreally shown up in the middle of the first world war. Now Diana Prince (she is never called Wonder Woman, even obliquely) is living discreetly as a civilian in the Washington of Ronald Reagan – or as discreetly as someone so resplendent can.Prince works as a demure archaeologist at the Smithsonian museum, and it is here that Diana examines an ancient stone that has the magical power to grant any person one wish. Poor, lonely Diana silently wishes to be reunited with Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) the dashing airman with whom she was once very much in love. But her nerdy colleague, maladroit gemologist Minerva, who has a beta-stalkerish fascination with the impossibly gorgeous Diana, wishes to be every bit as strong as her. And there is a third wisher: megalomaniac oil entrepreneur and museum donor Maxwell Lord (Pedro Pascal), who wants more than one wish, so he sneakily wishes to be turned into the stone, to become a human wishing stone, so that he can persuade any individual he meets to wish for something beneficial to his interests. Could it be that Maxwell Lord is a version of Norman Vincent Peale, the positive-thinking guru who was such an influence on presidents Nixon and Trump?Wonder Woman 1984 kicks off with two colossal and very entertaining set pieces. On the legendary island of Themyscira itself, Diana is shown as a little girl (played as in the first film by Lilly Aspell) competing precociously in the annual games: a daunting competition of physical fitness, endurance, archery and riding – and all alongside fully grown adults. Very exhilarating it is, too, culminating a moral lesson that grownup Diana is to make use of at the big finish. (Connie Nielsen and Robin Wright are incidentally shown here as older, wiser Amazons, but Diana seems to have remained in her beauteous prime for the past 60-odd years.) Then we see an attempted jewellery robbery at a very 1980s shopping mall, which is to disclose the magic jewel, and also allows Diana to let rip with some A1 baddie-thwarting. None of the succeeding action scenes has the pure sense of fun that this one does.So the chaotic, and CGI-internationally located action continues with some very ripe and eyebrow-raising depictions of Egypt. Chris Pine’s revived Steve has to occupy the body of an existing human in Washington, like a ghost, and the idea is that Diana is so in love that she (and we) see only Steve’s lovely chops. As for Diana herself, she sashays about the place with imperious confidence, and the white gown she wears for the museum party scene, slashed daringly up the leg, is a joy.Yet the scene-stealer is Wiig: she plays the klutzy loser, stumbling around the place because unlike Diana, she cannot handle heels, which are a very important signifier of female strength in this film.She is saved by Diana from being harassed by a drunk guy, which is the origin of her unwholesome envy-fascination. Her own transformation results in her being miraculously super-sexy, like Olivia Newton-John at the end of Grease – but then, bizarrely, she yearns in the mature flowering of her villainy to turn into a cheetah, as an alpha predator. (I think she looked better as a human rather than a lost cast member of Cats.)As so often, I wish that Wiig could have been given more properly funny lines but undermining the star’s seriousness is apparently not on – even though jokes are allowed in Marvel Cinematic Universe movies. This is an epically long and epically brash film from director and co-writer Patty Jenkins, but Gadot has a queenly self-possession and she imposes her authority on it. Wonder Woman 1984 is in cinemas from 16 December."
Farewell Amor review – humane and skilful Angolan diaspora tale,Director Ekwa Msangi extends equal sympathy to all the characters in this drama about a family reuniting in New York after many years apart,3,"Tanzanian-American writer-director Ekwa Msangi makes her feature debut with this warmly humane film after an apprenticeship in shorts, and it’s an auspicious start to a career that’s likely to accelerate fast.Judiciously balancing narrational tricksiness with an accessible emotional register, Msangi tells the story of a family of three reunited after a 17-year absence. Husband Walter (Ntare Guma Mbaho Mwine) met his wife Esther (Zainab Jah) when they were both firebrand students back in Angola. But the civil war in their homeland and economic necessity pulled them apart not long after the birth of their daughter Sylvia (Jayme Lawson, a mesmerising presence). Walter headed to Brooklyn, where he spent the years driving a taxi, while Esther took Sylvia to Tanzania for safety, where as a single parent she found support within the local church. Now that they’ve finally managed to reassemble the atoms of this nuclear family in a tiny one-bedroom apartment in New York, elation gives way to awkwardness as they adjust to each other’s orbits.However, secrets and, if not lies, unspoken truths get in the way. Walter, who found respite from his loneliness at the local African expat club, had been shacked up with another woman, nurse Linda (Nana Mensah), and he still secretly drinks in her smell from bedsheets hidden in a plastic bag at the bottom of closet. Esther’s religious zeal has turned her into someone quite different from the social scientist he used to know, while Sylvia, a dancer like her dad, feels she has to keep her passion for performance from her mother even as it presents a chance to integrate with other kids at her new high school.Msangi rolls back the tape to tell each of their stories and unveil their very different perspectives with adroit skill, using clothing cues and understated repetition to make it clear what’s going on without labouring the point. Perhaps a different film-maker might have made fervent Esther into a bigger villain, but refreshingly, Msangi’s empathy extends in every direction. It helps that the cast tune into each other so well, getting in time with one another like the proper dancers they are, and bring lovely resonances to what – in the end – is a slightly pat denouement. But as a bonus, the always-welcome Joie Lee, sister of Spike Lee and star of many of his older films, pops in as noisy but generous-spirited neighbour who knows which market has the freshest produce. Farewell Amor is on Mubi from 18 December."
Un Film Dramatique review – French youngsters get their say,"Pupils from a rough Paris neighbourhood capture their lives, including debate on everything from philosophy to racism in Eric Baudelaire’s invigorating doc",3,"“Do you have as good a chance of becoming president as someone from a fancy neighbourhood?” A teenage girl is interviewing a boy in her class. They’re pupils at a middle school in a banlieue on the outskirts of Paris known by its official départment number, “the 93”. It’s the poorest place in mainland France. Her classmate replies: “If I said ‘yes’, I’d be lying.” He is Guy-Yanis, a super-bright, charismatic boy of around 13. He’s a positive kid, and goes on to say that he tries hard to counter the prejudices people have about the 93 as a crime-ridden no-go zone.This documentary from Eric Baudelaire is a reminder of how much we can learn from the way teenagers see the world. Another kid brings a philosopher’s reasoning to the question of evil, and why the world needs bad people: “It’s good we’re not all the same. Otherwise there would be no problems, no stories.”Baudelaire gave cameras to the school’s film club to capture their everyday lives over four years. A crew also filmed their conversations about everything from movies to politics, racism and Islamophobia. There’s a heated debate between Guy-Yanis and another boy about whether Guy-Yanis is Ivorian or French (his parents emigrated to France from Côte d’Ivoire). “You’re 100% French! As French as cheese!”It’s these encounters that give the film its energy and optimism. On the other hand, unkind as it may be to point out, the footage shot by the pupils at home, bittily edited and put together without much in the way of explanation, is a slog. Still, what a worthwhile, inspiring project – and the kind of opportunity that might go some way towards putting the kids from the 93 on a level playing field with those from more privileged backgrounds. Un Film Dramatique is available from 21 December on Mubi."
The Mole Agent review – care-home spy uncovers wells of loneliness,"This documentary, set in an old people’s home in Chile, exasperatingly fails to come clean about its own setup",2,"There are moments of sweetness and sadness in Maite Alberdi’s documentary about an old people’s care home in Chile. But I couldn’t make friends with this film because of its pointless and twee contrivance, which undermined its genuine ideas. Not fakery exactly, but an exasperating lack of candour as to how this whole thing has been set up.We begin by seeing a Santiago private detective, Rómulo Aitken, who has placed an ad in a paper for an elderly man to be a spy or “mole agent” in an old people’s home, posing as someone needing short-term respite care. With the aid of gadgetry such as hidden cameras and microphones he must find evidence of elder abuse. The detective’s client is evidently a woman whose mother, Sonia Pérez, is in this home, and the daughter is worried. So a very sweet and lovable widower called Sergio Chamy is finally recruited and installed as a resident.But wait. The documentary, it turns out, already has a crew in this place, working openly with the home’s permission, having apparently assured it that they wish only to make an uncontroversial film about life there. The vast majority of the footage is from this team, with only a few seconds of the “secret” video from Sergio’s hidden cameras. So … when did Alberdi get involved? When she saw the newspaper ad? Or did she herself have the idea for a care-home film, and cooked up this semi-serious “mole agent” idea to give it a quirky spin?Either way, Sergio does not discover any elder abuse, only the residents’ loneliness and unhappiness and the scandalous way their relatives don’t visit them: a malaise in society which we are finally sort-of invited to accept is the real abuse. As for Sonia Pérez’s daughter … we never see her. Was the whole “abuse” worry a fictional premise? Sergio himself has real gentleness and is a lovely character, and there is some amiable comedy about how he is starting to enjoy himself in the home. But he is marooned in a tricksy, gimmicky film. The Mole Agent is in cinemas and on digital formats from 11 December."
Dreamland review – Margot Robbie hits the bank in twist on Bonnie and Clyde,A teenage boy becomes a sidekick for outlaw Robbie in this interesting 1930s-set action drama,3,"A lonely kid in a 1930s Texas dustbowl town dreams of adventure. Then it all comes to life when a fugitive bank robber, badly wounded, shows up and hides out in the family barn. But this film switches the gender assumptions: the criminal is a woman, Allison Wells, played by the movie’s producer-star Margot Robbie, and her teenage protector is a boy: Eugene Evans, played by Finn Cole – and soon they’re hatching plans together, lovestruck Eugene having been assured by the wide-eyed Allison that the much-publicised death of an innocent bystanderarising from her last robbery was due to crossfire from the police.This is an interesting twist on the Bonnie and Clyde template from screenwriting newcomer Nicolaas Zwart and director Miles Joris-Peyrafitte, who was an award-winner at Sundance last year with his debut feature As You Are. Eugene himself is unhappy and alienated because, when he was a kid, his dad abandoned the family to chase his dreams in the supposed paradise of Mexico, a land of mistily imagined golden beaches. Maybe Eugene has inherited that wayward outlaw gene. Meanwhile, his glowering stepdad George (Travis Fimmel) is a deputy sheriff who is, of course, committed to bringing down Allison and her accomplices, maybe with a posse who can share with him the cash bounty to which he might not otherwise be entitled.Dreamland is no masterpiece but it is a robustly made action drama, with impressive and even daring visual sequences when Eugene and Allison have to rob a bank. The ensuing chaos meshes with Eugene’s hallucinatory vision of what their future life in Mexico will be like. Interesting work from cinematographer Lyle Vincent, who also shot Ana Lily Amirpour’s A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night. Dreamland is in cinemas from 11 December."
Il Mio Corpo review – a taste of common humanity under Sicily's burning sun,Michele Panetta’s beautiful docu-fiction focuses on the parallel lives of a young Italian and a Nigerian migrant,4,"The title could allude to mass in the church in which some scenes are set (“Take, eat, this is my body”). But the bodies are more secular in this rather beautiful docu-fictional piece from Italian film-maker Michele Pennetta, a very physical movie about poverty and loneliness, about people whose bodies are perhaps all they have.Il Mio Corpo returns Pennetta to the Sicilian landscape he has explored in his previous feature Fishing Bodies, from 2016. This time, he has found two different real people in Sicily whose lives he brings together in a kind of diptych. One of them is Oscar, a tough, scrappy, lonely kid who may have been emotionally abused by his father – there is talk of a court case in which the judge heard testimony against Oscar’s father from Oscar himself, which clearly still rankles. Now things have been resolved and Oscar works for his dad in the scrap-metal business, scavenging for discarded old bits and pieces in the burning sun, with his dad yelling at him.Meanwhile, in another part of the island, Stanley is a Nigerian migrant awaiting an official decision on a visa that would allow him to stay. The local priest has found him some temporary work, including sheep herding, another activity with Christian echoes that is ultimately to bring Stanley and Oscar’s lives into alignment.Pennetta has evidently, in the loosest way, induced these two to act out improvised scenes indistinguishably close to their real lives, a guided fiction. The director intervenes authorially in the ending, and maybe Oscar’s discovery of a discarded Virgin Mary statue is not an accident. The film shows how much they have much in common, chiefly their vulnerability but also their unselfconscious, un-self-pitying courage. Their faces are vivid and Pennetta’s film somehow returns you to the simple, fundamental fact: these are real people whose lives carry on outside the movie screen’s perimeter. What is to become of them? Il Mio Corpo focuses on the forgotten and the marginalised. Il Mio Corpo is released on 11 December in cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema."
Wild Mountain Thyme review – Emily Blunt's Irish romcom is a mess,The actor stars alongside Jamie Dornan as stubborn farmers in this clumsy adaptation of John Patrick Shanley’s play Outside Mullingar,2,"If you’ve seen the trailer for Wild Mountain Thyme, writer-director John Patrick Shanley’s not-quite-a-romcom about two thirtysomething “star-crossed” (slow to settle into their inevitable pairing) lovers/farmers in rural Ireland, then you’ve most likely slammed into the question: what is going on with the accents? The mere teaser, with narration by American actor Christopher Walken, triggered an Irish accent emergency upon its release last month. The fears were justified: the accents are indeed bad. But that could be overlooked, perhaps even be endearing, with the requisite romcom chemistry or whimsy found between two emotionally repressed, isolated people learning to open up. Unfortunately, Shanley’s adaptation of his 2014 Broadway play Outside Mullingar has little to recommend besides some truly beautiful shots of Ireland’s County Mayo – it’s a visually verdant but emotionally flat film whose confusing friction between two miscast leads frustrates rather than engrosses.It is worth mentioning that Walken’s accent is especially bad as the crotchety Tony Reilly, waxing about the long history of his family’s farm abutting that of Chris Muldoon, whose rain-soaked wake precedes the first scene. Muldoon’s daughter Rosemary (Emily Blunt, sadly also a casualty of the accent curse) grew up pining for Tony’s boy, Anthony, played as an awkward, introverted adult by the Northern Irish but still accent-afflicted actor Jamie Dornan. Nearing his own demise and inexplicably hung up on Anthony’s bachelorhood, Tony stings his son by suggesting he pass the farm to a long-lost, sensible (read: practical, unromantic financier) nephew in New York, Adam (Jon Hamm). The one hindrance, besides betraying years of his son’s efforts: a strip of land cutting off access to the Reilly farm (the logistics are confusing – it involves two oft-mentioned gates) and owned by Rosemary, who remains determined to marry an aloof Anthony.Many of the film’s issues probably derive from its source material, which marked Debra Messing’s Broadway debut (with her own appalling Irish accent) as Rosemary and opened to tepidly mixed reviews – the Hollywood Reporter praised the play’s “emotional generosity”, while the Irish Times deemed the work “mystifyingly awful”. Shanley, who won a best screenplay Oscar for Moonstruck, and a Pulitzer and Tony for his 2004 play Doubt: A Parable, has penned a confusingly shallow script that brings the play’s emotional thinness and anachronisms into distracting, confounding focus. The story is ostensibly set in the present day, yet no character uses a cellphone or the internet. Anthony and Rosemary are allegedly in their mid-to-late 30s, yet there’s no indication of a romantic history or even life before the first scene (were they friends growing up? Teenage lovers? Did they live as neighbors for decades and just … not speak?) Rosemary has barely left her farm in western Ireland yet impulsively and seamlessly pulls off a two-day round trip to New York City to see a flirtatious Adam, and the most fazing event is the emotional resonance of the Swan Lake ballet.That Wild Mountain Thyme makes little logistical or temporal sense is not unique or even imperiling for a romantic comedy, which can spin gold out of straw scaffolding with the gift of charm, chemistry or the basic intrigue of will-they, won’t-they hijinks. That’s unfortunately missing here, as the film’s central tension – Anthony and Rosemary’s eventual union, it is not a spoiler when the resolution is so obviously baked into the premise – is undercut by a murky lack of conflict. What, exactly, keeps them apart? Shanley’s script chalks Anthony’s reluctance to propose to Rosemary up to a family curse of hard-headedness but there’s something vital missing.Absent any friction other than unsubstantiated stubbornness (and, in a baffling and strange late reveal, some magical realist thinking), it’s difficult to feel invested in the couple’s skirting around what seems to be a very straightforward and inevitable conversation. Instead, their final, minutes-long, romance-sparking row feels like watching two people argue over the infamous internet dress picture: circular and nonsensical to an outsider, impassioned but devoid of grounded feeling, ultimately stakes-less despite, in this case, a kiss in the rain (as promised on the film’s promotional poster).Shallowness aside, Wild Mountain Thyme has some merits. Stephen Goldblatt’s lush, tourism ad-esque cinematography on location in County Mayo is liable to make viewers pull a Rosemary and book a quick zip to the Emerald Isle as soon as this godforsaken pandemic is over. Dearbhla Molloy brings a wry grace (and an inoffensive accent) to Aoife, Rosemary’s wizened mother, the character who most successfully evokes the nostalgia and parochial familiarity the film strains to create. In other words, it’s certainly watchable, even pleasant – if you can get past whatever nonsense the characters are saying.Wild Mountain Thyme is released in cinemas and digitally in the US on 11 December with a UK date to be announced"
County Lines review – a deep dive into Britain's drugs trade hell,Henry Blake’s powerful debut feature tells the disturbing tale of a teenager drawn into a nightmarish world of criminality,4,"“You know what the ‘acceptable loss’ of your business is?” a social worker asks a teenager caught in Britain’s brutal “county lines” drug-trafficking business: “You.” That’s a message that rings loud and clear through this impassioned debut feature from writer-director Henry Blake, an alarming yet compassionate portrait of a headline-grabbing scandal that combines the warm artistry of a coming-of-age picture with the cold, hard truths of a public information film.Conrad Khan is Tyler, a disconsolate and somewhat hesitant 14-year-old whose mum, Toni (Ashley Madekwe), seems caught in a cycle of emotional and financial instability. After being bullied by older boys at a local cafe, Tyler thinks he’s found a potential protector in the shape of the enigmatic Simon. Brilliantly played by the versatile Harris Dickinson (unrecognisable from his breakthrough role in Eliza Hittman’s Beach Rats), Simon initially has the air of a tougher older brother, taking Tyler for a spin in his car and teaching him that it’s his duty to “be the man of the house” – to take care of business at home. Soon, Tyler is “running errands” for Simon, profitable but perilous work involving packages and train journeys, sold with empty promises of safety.Gradually, it begins to dawn on Tyler that, rather than finding his place in the world, he’s actually entered into a devil’s pact that will obliterate his identity and his sense of self. In this brutally unforgiving war zone (Blake significantly cites Elem Klimov’s Come and See as a tonal touchstone), he is no longer a person but a human shield – useful yet expendable.Having spent more than a decade as a youth worker, Blake has witnessed the harsh realities of child exploitation in the drugs trade, an industry that the National Crime Agency now estimates involves more than 10,000 vulnerable children. Like Ken Loach’s 1966 BBC TV play Cathy Come Home, which prompted parliamentary discussion of homelessness and unemployment, Blake’s film feels like an alarm bell, calling urgent attention to a contemporary crisis. Yet the traumatising realities of its modern-slavery message wouldn’t strike such a chord were County Lines not blessed with a level of cinematic poetry that both leavens and amplifies its plaintive themes.Working closely with cinematographer Sverre Sørdal, Blake leads us into the increasingly crepuscular world of Tyler’s experience, torn between childhood and adulthood (shades of Shola Amoo’s The Last Tree), inadvertently endangering the very family he’s convinced himself he must save. For all the vérité grit of the story, there’s an expressionist edge to the visuals, a quality that is amplified as Tyler’s life becomes ever more fractured and fragile.A nuanced central performance by Khan in his first starring role personalises wider issues, although Blake is at pains to remind us that Tyler is just the next in a long line of nameless victims. During the course of his story we see secondary characters at different points in the same narrative, whether their paths are simply crossing at a train station or clashing during horribly violent initiation rituals. Whatever the end-point ofTyler’s own journey, our ultimate focus is not on him, but on the wider web from which he may or may not escape.The result may prove too downbeat for some audiences, particularly in its unflinching depiction of extreme violence. But a mournfully ambient and somewhat ethereal score by James Pickering helps elevate this above mere social realism, finding unexpected shards of beauty in even the most dismal circumstances.County Lines is in cinemas and on digital platforms"
"Raised By Wolves review – staid, stale sci-fi from Ridley Scott","This 10-part series could have been the triumphant return of the Alien creator, but inconsistent world-building and a basic plot leave it unable to compete with the likes of Westworld",3,"When Ridley Scott calls, you answer, right? Or at least sit yourself down with alacrity – and a “Do not disturb” sign on the door – before his latest offering, the 10-part series Raised By Wolves (Sky Atlantic). While Scott directed only the first two, as executive producer his imprimatur is stamped throughout the tale of two androids (Mother, played by Amanda Collin, and Father, Abubakar Salim).They escape a warring, brutalised Earth for the desolate-but-just-about-habitable planet Kepler-22b with 12 embryos, a dozen jars of nutrients in which to raise them to maturity and all the programming they need to keep them firmly set on the mission to save humanity. Six make it to jar-term, but they are gradually picked off over the next decade or so by accidents and sickness on the increasingly inhospitable planet until only Campion is left.The war on Earth was between atheists and zealots – the Mithraic people who worship a deity called Sol. Mother and Father raise Campion as an atheist and discourage his growing urge to pray (“Peaceful. Technocratic. It is the only path to progress. Belief in the unreal can comfort human life, but also weaken it” – alas, none of the dinosaurs whose bones litter Kepler-22b died reading a copy of Syd Field’s Screenplay that could have been preserved for later generations).The relationship between Mother and Father begins to fracture. When an arkful of Mithraic survivors approaches the planet, Father wants to signal their settlement’s location so that Campion will have them for support once his “parents” wear out. Mother is having none of it; as Mithraic scouting parties land over the opening episodes, she becomes increasingly violent, in an attempt to protect what they have created together.It looks like a Scott creation – blue-grey palette, beautifully unforgiving landscapes filling the frame – and sets up his favourite themes: the clashes and connections between artificial intelligence and humans, the strengths and limitations of each, the religious impulse and the fact these rarely combine to produce a sunny vision of a future utopia. Plus, it is not long before some skittery, long-limbed monsters emerge from the darkness to wreak havoc.Unfortunately, what seems a set up for a triumphant return by the master falls apart fairly quickly. The world-building becomes riddled with inconsistencies. The androids are meant to be purely rational beings, yet they bury their children’s bodies and seem to mourn the losses, keep mementoes and cry. Mother keeps discovering abilities more akin to superhero than AI powers, which seem to be either forged by or the expression of maternal instinct made monstrous by frustration.It quickly comes to seem hysterical rather than noble or operatic, and forms part of the programme’s strangely reductive attitude to the female body and its workings (especially from within the ambit of the man who gave us Ripley). The pregnant teenage rape survivor of a church elder, Tempest, is given little to do beyond being an emblem of religious hypocrisy, feeling conflicted about her foetus and being assured by Mother that “the child is innocent”.Not that any other characters fare much better. Children and adults alike are mere ciphers; there is no one to root for or invest in. The potential for commentary on and insight into the parallels and divergences between AI and human intelligence – raw computing power versus the higher brain functions that breed art and culture – or between religion and science goes unrealised (at least in the early episodes available for review).Father’s effortful dad jokes aside, the tone is unrelentingly bleak. Much of the time is taken up with the survivors finding ways to avoid Mother’s wrath and subsist on Kepler-22b – presumably until they are old enough to start shagging (this ultimate point of the child cohort that Mother adds to the settlement adding an extra layer of disquieting ickiness to proceedings). These longueurs are occasionally relieved by well-done action sequences (especially during the flashbacks to the war on Earth), but these do little to deepen the story.It is not the fact that there is nothing new on show. Delivered with enough panache, there will always be an appetite for traditional sci-fi tropes reassembled to bang home the usual messages. But Raised By Wolves does not have panache – and the thin, unsophisticated story it comprises stands naked, particularly cruelly so in a post-Westworld landscape. Humanity is not up to much, for sure, but we were ready for more than this."
Mank review: David Fincher's sumptuous ode to old Hollywood,"Gary Oldman plays Citizen Kane screenwriter Herman J Mankiewicz in Fincher’s stagey, method-style drama",4,"David Fincher’s messy, often brilliant Mank, which follows Hollywood screenwriter Herman J Mankiewicz (Gary Oldman) as he wrestles with the screenplay for Orson Welles’s Citizen Kane, is ostensibly about writing. But in fact, as a piece of film-making, it’s perhaps more helpful to think in terms of performance. This is film-making as role-playing, which has immersed itself, method-style, in a past era and aesthetic, which wears its luminous black-and-white cinematography like a costume.This results, at times, in a certain theatricality in the approach – the screenplay, by Fincher’s late father, Jack, is full of zingers but relies on rooms full of heavyweight egos stagily taking turns to deliver them. It won’t be for everyone. But in the canon of films about film-making, there are few as textured, as committed and as suffused with real appreciation for the craft as Mank.Of the performances, Oldman’s has been lauded as great. It’s certainly a turn that is emphatically sure of itself, which is almost the same thing but not quite. But Amanda Seyfried is legitimately superb as Marion Davies, bringing a patina of vulnerability to the big-hearted, brassy broad.Mank is on Netflix"
Crock of Gold: A Few Rounds with Shane MacGowan review – a sombre salute,Julien Temple rounds up the old gang for bleakly worshipful profile of the recalcitrant Pogues star,4,"This full-length profile of the former Pogues frontman Shane MacGowan emerges just as the annual debate over the lyrics of his biggest hit, Fairytale of New York, gets into full swing. While the controversy is not specifically addressed here, you have to wonder how the defund-the-BBC types will react to MacGowan’s enthusiastic endorsement of Irish uprisings against the British and adoration of the IRA – “I felt ashamed I didn’t have the guts to join [them],” he says at one point.There’s a lot of interest in here, even if many of the anecdotes are well worn: MacGowan’s early years in Tipperary, his schooldays in Tunbridge Wells and the Barbican, and his formative time in the late 70s punk circuit. It’s an hour in before we even get to the Pogues, none of whose members are interviewed here; instead, it’s his sister Siobhan and father Maurice who make the most telling contributions. The former is no-nonsense and direct, telling of her awe when she first heard audiences chanting her brother’s name and her decision to commit him to a psychiatric clinic in the late 80s. MacGowan Sr, on the other hand, sniffs with entertainingly Celtic disgust over his teenage son’s burgeoning interest in Anglo-American rock: “He discovered Creedence Clearwater Revival!”Julien Temple, with his long experience of filming recalcitrant punk-rock types, is probably the only director who could have made this film work: MacGowan clearly doesn’t want to be interviewed and is not really in optimal physical shape to be. Instead, Temple assembles an artful bricolage with snippets of recordings, archive raids, filmed reconstruction and his trademark hand-drawn animation. In what probably seemed like a smart tactic at the time, Temple also has a bunch of MacGowan’s friends – including Johnny Depp (who is one of the film’s producers), Bobby Gillespie and, improbably, Gerry Adams – to try and draw MacGowan out; but these sessions really don’t add a great deal. It’s like listening to barflies arguing about the change.In the end, the film operates best as an act of ancestor-worship to an extraordinary musician whose best days – we are forced to sadly conclude – appear to be behind him. Death stalks the film, and not just because MacGowan has defied the odds after years of drug and alcohol abuse. Early on, he reveals his preoccupation with the ghosts of his dead relatives (which prompted his return to Catholicism) as well the victims of the Irish famine whose bones he says he accidentally unearthed on a beach in Mayo (resulting in The Dunes, which he gave to Ronnie Drew to record). For all that, MacGowan is still a life force to be reckoned with."
The Glass Man review – lo-fi Brit horror still full of chills,Andy Nyman is a treat as a middle-class man in debt forced to accompany a mysterious criminal for a night in a film made in 2011 but still relevant,3,"This low-budget British psychological horror first premiered at FrightFest all the way back in 2011 but, due to a rights dispute, is only now receiving a wider release. This long delay hasn’t done The Glass Man much harm, thanks to the continuing relevance of its recessionary backdrop and the growing fame of lead actor Andy Nyman, now well known for the 2017 film adaptation of his stage hit Ghost Stories.A clean-shaven Nyman stars as Martin Pyrite, a man whose apparently comfortable, upper-middle class life is falling apart behind the scenes. He’s been fired from his job for reasons that are unclear, amassed a huge amount of debt, and is keeping all this secret from his genteel wife Julie (Neve Campbell). After a traumatic confrontation with his furious boss (Don Warrington) and an avoidant HR manager (Lorraine Burroughs), Martin spends a day deferring the inevitable, chit-chatting politely with shop assistants, while indulging in little luxuries he can ill-afford. It’s a tense and unsustainable situation, which comes to a head when a mysterious debt collector named Pecco (James Cosmo, by turns menacing and avuncular) arrives at the Pyrites’ front door. This Pecco is offering an impossible choice: pay up immediately or become his accomplice for a wild night of unspecified criminal acts.Cristian Solimeno’s script is witty, well-plotted and goes to darker-than-expected places, but his direction isn’t always up to the necessary task of disguising budgetary constraints. The Glass Man looks cheaply and hurriedly made, which is a particular problem when it comes to depicting the supposedly well-heeled surroundings of characters like Martin and his old school chum-turned-movie star Toby Huxley (played by Solimeno in one pivotal scene). The performances are assured though, leading to an appropriately shattering conclusion. The Glass Man is released on 7 December on digital formats."
Jungleland review – a neon-lit squint at the American dream,"A bare-knuckle boxing tournament offers two brothers the chance of a better life in this handsome, gloomy drama starring Charlie Hunnam and Jack O’Connell",3,"Fed up of ducking bailiffs and squatting in abandoned houses, brothers Stan (Charlie Hunnam) and Lion (Jack O’Connell) leave western Massachusetts and head for Jungleland, a competitive bare-knuckle boxing tournament in California with a cash prize of $400,000. In order to secure Lion’s name on the ticket, the opportunistic Stan strikes a dodgy deal with a gangster named Pepper (The Last Black Man in San Francisco’s Jonathan Majors, memorable in a flashy white suit), agreeing to “move a package”. The package turns out to be Sky (Jessica Barden), a flinty young woman with a grim secret.Neon-lit diners, lonely service stations and empty parking lots are straight out of an Edward Hopper painting in this handsome, gloomy drama. The title comes from the Bruce Springsteen song, along with its central theme of a promised land just out of reach. Brits Hunnam, O’Connell and Barden are strangely well cast as its all-American grifters. (Hunnam in particular gives a finely tuned performance as a washed-up smooth talker who still knows how to flirt.) On VOD platforms from 30 November"
In brief: The Nolan Variations; Paris By Starlight; Nat Tate – review,Tom Shone’s fascinating study of film director Christopher Nolan; a delightful adventure from Robert Dinsdale; and the story of William Boyd’s celebrated art world hoax,0,"Faber, £30, pp381Whether you believe that the film director Christopher Nolan is the second coming of cinema or an overrated poseur, Tom Shone’s fascinating quasi-biography offers compelling insights into his psyche and methods. Nolan emerges as punctilious, thoughtful, hyper-aware of his own intellect (“Like [my film] more unreservedly,” he upbraids Shone at one point) and a genuine visionary. At a time when mainstream cinema seems dominated by special effects and empty spectacle, this beautifully written book makes a convincing case for Nolan as the last of the great auteurs.Del Rey, £12.99, pp467Robert Dinsdale’s follow-up to his excellent The Toymakers treads a similarly rich furrow of magic and terror, making this the perfect Christmas gift for the imaginative and adventurous. His appealing novel follows the characters of Levon and Isabelle on a quest through a dreamlike Paris and is somewhat reminiscent of His Dark Materials in its depiction of the city as simultaneously realistic and otherworldly. Dinsdale beautifully captures the dreamlike dissonance of storytelling and invention, even as his brave characters are threatened by dark forces beyond their comprehension.Penguin, £8.99, pp80 (paperback)In his new afterword to this reissue of his famous “fake biography”, William Boyd wryly states: “Resigned to my fate as Dr Frankenstein, I look at Nat Tate, the monster I created, and I have to confess to an odd feeling of baffled satisfaction.” From its beginnings in 1998 as a David Bowie-assisted hoax that conned gullible figures in the art world, Boyd’s jeu d’esprit, a short monograph on the life of the fictitious artist Tate, can now be enjoyed as an entertaining companion piece to his masterly Any Human Heart.

Hillbilly Elegy review – Glenn Close and Amy Adams trade Appalachian cliches,Close and Adams are all platitudes and prosthetics in Ron Howard’s hackneyed adaptation of a rags-to-riches memoir ,2,"“Your people will have your back. That’s our code,” insists Yale law student JD Vance (Gabriel Basso), reflecting on the Appalachian values of his Kentucky family. Director Ron Howard’s misjudged attempt to translate that code into a feelgood movie only highlights the limits of Hollywood intervention. Based on Vance’s hugely popular conservative memoir about class mobility, the film ping-pongs between the lead-up to a key job interview and flashbacks to the poverty the venture capitalist would eventually transcend.It’s a prestige slog, full of flat, sneering caricatures. A prosthetics-disguised Glenn Close gurns through platitudes about family, good manners and hard work in an oversize T-shirt and distracting wig as Vance’s grandmother. The usually reliable Amy Adams is even worse, descending into shrieking histrionics as his opioid-addicted mother. The performances create anthropological distance, not human empathy.Hillbilly Elegy is on Netflix"
Locked In: Breaking the Silence review – life-affirming story of a devastating illness,Xavier Alford’s striking documentary explores the lives of people at different stages of coping with ‘locked-in’ syndrome – including himself,4,"A neurological horror story lies at the centre of Xavier Alford’s chilling, stoic and finally revitalising documentary, part of the BBC Storyville strand. Guillain-Barré syndrome is a rare condition that can strike without warning, where the immune system attacks the nerves, sometimes leaving the victim completely paralysed. “A passenger in your own body” or “a weird wormhole – you dream all the time” is how one person interviewed sums it up – though he subsequently recovers.But director Alford has to suffer a second horror: knowing his fate. Alford’s illness, known as multifocal motor neuropathy, is related to Guillain-Barré syndrome but is progressive over many years, palsying the outer extremities first – we first see him struggling to grasp his camera. Being, as one clinician points out, “the sort of person who wants to know”, Alford resolves to learn as much as possible about what awaits him. In what is obviously a therapeutic quest, he spends the film meeting other people in different phases of this chronic neuropathy.At one point he confronts the worst-case scenario: a patient called Rob, who loses even the ability to communicate with his left eyelid, and has his life support switched off. His wife, while being told it is just a “medical decision” for which she bears no responsibility, is effectively asked to agree that it is what he would have wanted.Though the case studies are interesting, Alford’s film becomes truly illuminating as he probes this ethical territory in his own life. What is the level of responsibility he has the right to expect of his wife, Anna, and children – and his own obligations to communicate his inner experience to them? The film makes this possible for him, but his other half – virtually refusing to appear on camera – questions if this is appropriate. Who can say? What’s certain is that this bleak, patient inquest is relevant far beyond one rare syndrome. Locked In: Breaking the Silence is on BFI Player and BBC iPlayer from 30 November."
We Are Who We Are review – Luca Guadagnino's teen drama burns slowly,"The Call Me By Your Name director’s debut TV outing is beautifully shot and languorously paced, but it might need an energy boost if we are to stick with its angsty protagonist",3,"Only one of the eight episodes of We Are Who We Are (BBC Three), award-winning film director Luca Guadagnino’s first television outing, was available for preview. This seems a mistake, given that the coming-of-age story of a group of teenagers on an American airbase in Italy is so clearly a slow burner. It has been described by those in the US as exquisite, lyrical, poetic and in many other terms that loosely translate as “admirable, a talent showcase and yet ever so slightly boring at first sight”. Allowing for that handicap, then, let us sally forth and, like protagonist Fraser – roaming round the new home his US colonel mother, Sarah (Chloë Sevigny), and her wife, Maggie (a mere major, played by Alice Braga), have brought him to – see what there is for us.At 14, Fraser (brilliantly played by Jack Dylan Grazer) is an unlovely piece of work. Face (complete with bumfluff moustache) set in a permanent sneer, headphones plugged as permanently into his ears, he is a self-indulgent mass of hormones and attitude. He is full of contempt for humanity and resentment of Sarah, who has brought the family to the Venuto military base so that she can take over from the outgoing commander. During one extended sequence of Frazer’s explorations of his new territory, my notes record that “he’s even annoying riding a bike”.Fortunately, before he becomes too repellent to the viewer, he is taken up by Britney, an emollient presence (played by Francesca Scorsese – yes, daughter of) who introduces him to her gang of friends. It includes a girl who has already caught his eye, Caitlin (newcomer Jordan Kristine Seamón), whom he later discovers posing as a boy at a cafe off the base and chatting up a girl. It is Fraser – who has an intense friendship with someone called Mark back home in New York, and an eye for a handsome soldier himself – who will introduce her to the concept of a non-binary identity and the ability to move between or abandon the expectations society has set up for you.Although We Are Who We Are is primarily a coming of age story, it is also one deeply interested in liminality – a very teenage concern too, of course, even if they rarely give their emotional insecurities, navigation of the treacherous crossing from the child to adult world, and their trying on and discarding of various social roles and positions such a name. The base itself is America within Italy, but its border is porous and the gang pick up some Italian language, as well as befriending soldiers of all nationalities within it. Sarah and Maggie are gay women in an aggressively heteromasculine world, always having to approach and respond circumspectly to inferiors’ and superiors’ reactions.There are strange transgressions in Fraser’s family dynamic. Sarah and Maggie make little effort not to let him see them slipping into the bath together, and while his mother may rule with a rod of iron outside the home, she allows Fraser to demand alcohol from her and to slap her face without comeback when she fails to make a sandwich to his liking. When she cuts her finger, Fraser sucks it like a baby. When Maggie rescues him from what is evidently just the latest in a long line of drunken escapades, they have a (too?) adult conversation about how much Sarah loves each of them. “Sometimes when she’s kissing me,” says Maggie, “she doesn’t acknowledge me. It feels like she’s kissing a mirror.” Fraser remains convinced he is second in his mother’s affections, and when she comes near to hug him and talk he is still young enough to cry “invisible shield, invisible shield!” to repel her.If beautifully shot, languorously paced character and mood pieces are your thing, you are going to be very happy with eight hours of this, especially if it maintains the opening episode’s ability to avoid ever tipping into smugness at just how much beauty and talent it has managed to assemble and play with. For others, unless that languorous pace picks up just a little and the characters become just a little more active, and the mood is driven by something more tangible than the sun-saturated landscape, We Are Who We Are may feel too inert to be worth keeping faith with. At the moment it feels slightly hollow – a confection of surfaces rather than a whole, pulsing story. At the same time, there is clearly rich potential here, and much that could and maybe will be done with it."
Apocalyptic goo and Detroit in beats: Jarman award 2020 is shared,"Whitechapel Gallery, LondonJenn Nkiru’s standout film of Detroit’s techno history evokes the rhythm of fractured black lives in a show with no winner but plenty to mull over",0,"A tsunami of black, computer-generated goo rushes along ancient streets, floods a courtyard and inundates a chapel. Fires break out, smoke and flame billowing around minarets and churches. The opening scenes of Larissa Sansour’s 2019 film In Vitro are gripping enough, before you realise that the city in question is an apocalyptic Bethlehem, where time runs in several directions at once, and there’s a big, black, sci-fi sphere haunting the basement of a brutalist sanctuary. All this must be a metaphor for something or other. “Bethlehem,” one of the protagonists says, “was always a ghost town, the present upstaged by the past.”Philosophical ruminations about time and memory, played out by a dying Palestinian revolutionary who spends her time in bed and either her daughter or her clone (I found all this confusing; maybe it is meant to be) take up much of In Vitro’s beautifully shot, split-screen, black and white half-hour.One of the six works in the current Film London Jarman award, In Vitro is an uneasy mix of futuristic plague and ruination, memories of bucolic days picking olives, of exile, family relationships, abandoned houses and CGI effects. An olive tree goes up in flames and a nun walks the street of this little West Bank town, a gas mask poking out beneath her wimple. I thought for a moment she’d wandered into the daylight from some subterranean BDSM club. Derek Jarman might have liked this last image, and might also approve that the judges have decided to split the prize equally this year. This is not a time for competitions. However, we are entitled to like some things more than others.Hannah Quinlan and Rosie Hastings’ In My Room takes its title from Nancy Sinatra’s 1966 song, which a bearded guy sings, unaccompanied, in what appears to be an abandoned nightclub. Two other guys dance, smoochily, in what was once one of Birmingham’s gay clubs, till it was closed down. In part an elegy to queer dance culture and the gentrification of queer spaces, In My Room also takes us, moodily, into wintry spinneys and commons at night. We don’t come across any actual cruising, more’s the pity, but men do slowly undress, to camera. There’s dancing in the electric twilight of the disco (David Byrne singing I’m Lazy seems an odd accompaniment), and a woman pole-dances athletically to Cindy Lauper’s Girls Just Wanna Have Fun. Boys want to have fun, too, but it is all oddly chaste, and not at all as sexy or as transgressive as Jarman’s work could be (let alone Isaac Julien’s, or any number of queer radical film-maker, going back to Kenneth Anger and beyond).The energy and focus kicks in with Jenn Nkiru’s Black to Techno, a visually stunning and playful montage dedicated to the birth of techno in Detroit; how it developed from rap and the Motown sound and the repetitive, insistent clamour and din of the city’s automobile industry. The work explains that the machinery “built into the daily movement of black bodies the mimesis of movement, morphing later into a technology of rhythm”. A group of women DJs bend over record decks in the car factory, as diligent and focused on the turntables as any machinist or lathe operator. Even Ford got into the beats with an ad that announces Detroit Techno, Ford Focus. Black musicians drum on an empty lot, and we cruise past the grim little house where legendary record producer and rapper J Dilla grew up with his family. His mother was a former opera singer.The metronomic four-to-the-floor beat leads us back to stock footage of the repetitive, mechanical labour of picking and baling cotton, and forward via the automobile industry to Berlin’s techno scene and the Tresor club, first housed in a former East Berlin department store. As important as the rhythm itself are the silences between the beats, which teeter on emptiness and evoke the fractured histories of black experience. The African drum was the first telephone, we’re told, and techno broke the Berlin Wall. Nkiru’s film is phenomenal. It bristles with ideas, and histories, with none of Sansour’s portentousness. Meanings proliferate naturally as we watch. It is like a bomb going off.What Peckham-based Nkiru does for Detroit, Andrea Luka Zimmerman attempts, in a very different way, to do for Newcastle upon Tyne. Zimmerman’s Civil Rites takes Martin Luther King’s visit to receive an honorary doctorate from Newcastle University in 1967 as a starting point to a journey through the city, visiting places where acts of social protest and resistance have taken place. A garbage truck draws up in front of the bookshop where in 1792 freed slave and anti-slavery campaigner Olaudah Equiano was based. We find ourselves at the road junction where Arthur Conan Doyle gave a speech denouncing atrocities in Congo in 1909, and stand outside a Job Centre on whose site the Workers and Soldiers Council for the Russian Revolution held a meeting in 1917. One anonymous doorway gives no indication that here was once a prison where suffragettes on hunger strike were force-fed, or that, beyond the entrance to a locked swimming pool, there was a swim-in against pool closures a few years ago. Subtitles mark the spot, on ring roads and in Grainger Town, outside shopping malls and chippies, on back streets and in suburbs. The entire city appears to be a psychogeography of protest. Voiceover interviews interject subjects of racial harassment and poverty, while in numerous shots we see evidence of homelessness.What we might see as an activist turn is also the focus of the Hastings-based Project Art Works, whose Illuminating the Wilderness is a film documentary of a visit to Scotland by film-makers (including Ben Rivers and Margaret Salmon), who accompanied a number of neuro-divergent adults, their carers and families on a two-week trip to the Highlands. It rains and it rains some more. There is much trampling through mud, and playing gleeful games of I-spy while cramped damply together in Land Rovers. There is much staring into the undergrowth. Do you want to walk to the bothy? It is only six miles. Someone finds a worm. Look, there’s a frog. Autistic artist Sharif Persaud insists on wearing a homemade Al Murray mask, and gets his wellies mired in the mud. Subtitles announce that someone is “happy blowing” or “rocking”. The upbeat voices of carers cut through indecipherable chatter. “It is very boring here,” Sharif says in the gloaming, truth speaking to power. I find all this problematic.Michelle Williams Gamaker’s 2017 House of Women, one of a trilogy of short films, takes Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger’s 1947 movie Black Narcissus as its starting point. In the film, white actor Jean Simmons, wearing pan-stick blackface, plays the non-speaking but central role of an Indian dancer. Through a series of screen-test auditions, Williams Gamaker interviews young south Asian actors for the role, although her real purpose is more complex, and she uses the opportunity to discover something more about the young actors’ ambitions, returning them the voices, and presence, denied by the original directors of Black Narcissus. Both invasive and intimate, the film is itself a house of women, and a series of in-camera encounters. Tender, unsettling and oddly compelling, House of Women is pretty good, but Nkiru knocks everything else out of the park. As it is, everyone’s a winner this year."
Fall of a Kingdom review – dull trudge through war and romance,Bear attacks and marauding hordes can’t rescue this dismal attempt to conjure up an epic medieval adventure,1,"Say what you like about the artistic integrity of Game of Thrones, but at least it never skimped on the saucy stuff. Fall of a Kingdom pitches itself as “Game of Thrones meets Braveheart”, but lacks the redeeming feature that united both those sources of inspiration: entertainment value. It’s a dull historical action drama that is in desperate need of some gratuitous sex or violence to liven up its near two-hour running time.Originally called The Rising Hawk and shot in Ukraine (home country of co-director Akhtem Seitablaev), Fall of a Kingdom attempts to conjure an epic sense of adventure with its Carpathian mountains backdrop and large cast of costumed extras. Maksim (Alex MacNicholl) and Myroslava (Poppy Drayton) are the children of rival neighbouring chieftains; they begin courting during a bear attack, but have a hard time overcoming Myroslava’s family’s opposition to their union. “No daughter of mine will be picking berries!” booms her stern father (Tommy Flanagan).Such romantic tribulations soon fade into insignificance, however, when word reaches Maksim of invading Mongol hordes massacring villagers. Their halcyon days are over and the local tribes must put aside generations-old grievances and unite against a common enemy. This is all based on history – the 13th-century Mongol invasion of eastern Europe – but the too-pristine costumes make it look more like a hobbyist historical reenactment than a privileged glimpse into the past. That’s a quibble, though. The real reason Fall of a Kingdom falls so flat is its lack of any characterisation or effective storytelling. Without these basics, it’s impossible to distinguish one grubby peasant from another, much less care whether he gets trampled under a Mongolian steed, shot through the throat with an arrow or burned to death when his hovel is razed to the ground. Fall of a Kingdom is available on digital formats from 30 November."
Skyfire review – fiery volcanic action thriller fails to generate much heat,"Chinese-produced disaster movie proceeds on strictly generic lines, as a volcano theme park is imperilled by an actual eruption",2,"‘This might be the safest place on Earth!” Uh oh. A flamboyant entrepreneur is reassuring a group of tourists in a glass elevator at his volcano theme park – built on an active volcano in the Pacific Rim. The tourists are about to descend 150 metres inside the volcano. A cute kid pushes her nose up against the glass in wide-eyed wonder. Double uh oh.Skyfire is China’s first big budget disaster movie, an earnest emotional blockbuster with disappointing special effects that barely register on the Richter scale of excitement. What it does have, however, is a credible female hero in the Tom-Cruise-dangling-out-of-a-helicopter-in-Ray-Bans mould. She is Meng Li (Hannah Quinlivan), a hot-headed young volcanologist who works at the theme park. When the volcano suddenly erupted 20 or so years ago, it killed her scientist mother. The next eruption isn’t due for 150 years, but Meng Li has detected unusual activity in the core. The park’s owner is entrepreneur Jack Harris, played by English actor Jason Isaacs with a Trumpy orange tan. His scenes are mostly in English and the movie is directed by a Brit, Simon West (Con Air and Lara Croft: Tomb Raider). Harris won’t listen to Meng Li’s concerns. “Give the guests free drink” he snaps as the volcano starts spewing; he’s a textbook corporate bad guy.Actually, all the characters in the film are thumbnail-sketches – even Meng Li, who is driven to finish the research project her mother began on the volcano. Her estranged dad, also a scientist, shows up for a bit of family healing and father-daughter heroics, rescuing holidaymakers and folk from a nearby village. The best action set-piece is a vertigo-sufferer’s worst nightmare, with passengers leaping from one cable car to another mid-air. But mostly this isn’t the thrill-ride you might be hoping for. There’s plenty of fire but, oddly, not much heat. Released on 23 November on digital formats."
Concrete Plans review – resentful brickies build up the tension,"In this claustrophobic if unconvincing thriller, an arrogant landowner incurs the wrath of the builders renovating his ancestral home",2,"There’s some really strong acting talent involved in this claustrophobic thriller set in south Wales, including the excellent Steve Speirs, who recently showed what a great comic turn he is as Burbage in Ben Elton’s Upstart Crow. But, however much I wanted to like it, this film never quite gelled: the dialogue and the confrontations seemed forced; some characters looked and sounded like caricatures; and the moment of escalation from tension into open violence was unconvincing.Kevin Guthrie plays Simon, an arrogant landowner who is refurbishing the ancestral home as part of a colossal tax dodge on the advice of his slippery accountant Richard (James Lance). To do this, he has hired five builders: Bob (Speirs), Jim (Chris Reilly), Dave (William Thomas), Steve (Charley Palmer Rothwell) and Viktor (Goran Bogdan), a Ukrainian immigrant whose smouldering good looks appear to catch the eye of Simon’s beautiful, troubled wife Amy (Amber Rose Revah).Simon makes these builders live on a horrible caravan on the estate, treats them like dirt, neglects to pay them on time, and makes a deeply misjudged attempt to be matey by joining them for a hand of poker in their squalid van and loses heavily – thus compounding his sin in not coming through with the wages.The problem is that too often the film sounds like a quaint fantasy of what rich people sound like, what not-rich people sound like, and what criminals sound like. But there are some nice performances: I liked the stoicism of Thomas’s veteran grafter Dave, which unravels into resentment at the youngsters’ annoying attitude. Concrete Plans is available on digital platforms from 23 November."
"Ext.Night review – After Hours-ish, Cairo-set yarn hampered by misogyny",An intriguing comedy drama about a film-maker who falls foul of a taxi driver and a sex worker is atmospheric but muddled,2,"Independent Egyptian director Ahmad Abdalla, whose previous dramatic features (including Rags & Tatters, Heliopolis and Microphone) found favour on the festival circuit, takes a swerve into comic territory with this compact, bumpy picaresque set over 12 hours or so in Cairo. Although the dialogue touches occasionally on politics and the repressive authoritarian regime currently in power, the narrative engine is driven largely by a more universally relatable subject: the exposure of a smug member of the elite to the cruelties and petty grifts of the underclass. Think After Hours, but in Arabic, and with more police brutality.Film director Moe (Karim Kassem) is first met having a tough day at work shooting a commercial for money; he is also being guilt tripped by a photographer friend (Donia Maher) who wants him to help champion the cause of another friend who has been imprisoned for writing a novel using forbidden swear words. Judging by the subtitles, this kind of coarse language is as common among Moe’s diverse circle of acquaintance as it is anywhere else, but the consequences are much more severe for those daring to use it in print (or, presumably, in a film like this).Although Moe is reluctant to get involved, he’s accidentally ends up getting into all kinds of trouble when a detour made by his working-class taxi driver Mustafa (Sherief El Desouky) introduces him to a feisty sex worker named Toto (Mona Hala, a proper force of nature), who is smart, sexy and as filthy mouthed as it gets.You hope that the occasional bursts of misogyny and violence Mustafa directs towards Toto are not meant to be endorsed by the director himself. But, like his obvious fictional avatar Moe, who just sits there and watches it all happen, the film itself appears not to castigate or censor such abhorrent treatment of women. Perhaps viewers inside the culture itself may catch what nuance there may be, but I suspect even they might find the film’s stance on class and gender a little muddled, perhaps intentionally.It also doesn’t help that occasionally there are cutaways to what seems an entirely different film – where a man ends up being nearly lost as sea – scenes that may be from a project Moe abandoned some time ago. Nevertheless, Abdalla’s own jittery handheld camerawork and use of Egyptian pop create a seductive, gritty sense of atmosphere. Ext.Night is available on Mubi from 23 November."
Cemetery review – elephant heads for the graveyard in hardcore art piece,"Carlos Casas’s film – half documentary, half experimental essay – is a near-wordless evocation of a ‘celebrity’ Sri Lankan elephant’s confrontation with death",3,"Carlos Casas’s Cemetery arrives on the arthouse streaming service Mubi, a slow sensory film with a magnetic pull of strangeness; it may test the endurance of even Mubi’s hardcore highbrow audience. Somewhere between an experimental art piece and a nature documentary, there’s no story here in the normal sense, and it’s almost entirely wordless. Which is not to say that Cemetery is silent; wildlife audio recordist Chris Watson has put together a wondrously rich sonic landscape of nature sounds.The setting is Sri Lanka, where an elderly elephant called Nga makes his way to the mythical elephant graveyard. In the first chapter Nga and his human keeper – a mahout – live alongside each other deep in a forest. Casas has said that Nga is a well-known elephant in Sri Lanka, as famous as George Clooney; though surely he’s more of a Bogart – lugubrious and leather-faced.The camera lingers for 30 or 40 seconds at a time in closeups of different parts of Nga. It gets right up to one of his orangey-brown eyes, almost comically tiny on such a huge head. You find yourself searching for meaning, and Casas is perhaps saying something here about our need to anthropomorphise the natural world. Elsewhere, he creates the point-of-view of the elephant, lumbering through the trees.In chapter two, poachers arrive, violating the scene with guns and charging the atmosphere with danger. Chapter three feels almost like a parody, as Nga approaches the graveyard in the dead of night: for over 15 minutes the screen is almost entirely black, though the soundtrack is alive with insect chirps. You could just as easily picture this film playing on the white walls of a gallery as a cinema – if either were open. Cemetery is available on Mubi from 18 November."
Nova Lituania review –  droll study of a Baltic state's identity crisis,"This rewarding period drama, set during the interwar years, suggests the creation of an alternative Lithuania to counter invasion ",3,"Although aggressively retro both in terms of its subject – the annexation of Lithuania during the second world war – and visually, given that it’s shot in a boxy aspect ratio and in silvery black and white, this droll period drama from the Baltic is imbued with a very 21st-century arthouse approach to storytelling. Wilfully stingy with its explication, and seemingly made on the assumption that viewers will know at least something about recent Lithuanian history, it’s a fairly rarefied work, but rewarding for those up for a challenge.Playfully padding out a rickety skeleton of historical fact with fleshy fiction, first-time writer-director Karolis Kaupinis creates a counterfactual drama set just before the start of the second world war in Kaunas, which was then the tiny nation’s capital as the Polish army had occupied Vilnius, Lithuania’s principal city, in 1920. Academic Feliksas Gruodis (Aleksas Kazanavičius), a geographer inspired by real-world figure Kazys Pakštas, has an ambitious idea to start a “backup Lithuania” somewhere far away – Argentina, say, or Angola – just in case the original Lithuania gets colonised by a larger neighbour (Germany or the Soviet Union).While most think this is an entirely daft notion, when Gruodis accidentally meets former prime minister Jonas (Vaidotas Martinaitis) at a ceremony he finds a receptive audience for his not-entirely-addled scheme, which might just be the best hope for saving a culture suddenly all the more at risk from eradication. Meanwhile, Feliksas’s awkward menage at home mirrors the geopolitical situation, with his wife and mother-in-law locked in a domestic power struggle that makes the company of a pretty visiting relative seem like a far more attractive prospect.Readers of Michael Chabon’s The Yiddish Policeman’s Union, his counterfactual novel from 2007, would be aware that the idea of relocating a nation or tribe of people to a remote wilderness – for instance, moving the Jews to Alaska instead of Palestine – was a current concept before the war. Given that, it seems a little odd that this film, while contemplating in a wry, sophisticated way anxieties around nationalism and colonialism, fails to engage with the fact that nearly 200,000 Jewish Lithuanians were wiped out during the war. But maybe that’s a story for a different film. Nova Lituania is on Mubi."
Eastern review – Polish 'western' of male humiliation and revenge,A blood feud takes on a tragic dimension in this thriller of ritualised killing and vendettas between two families in the suburbs,4,"Set aside the Ennio Morricone-homaging soundtrack and Eastern isn’t as much “western” as it is Greek. The detached wide shots framing bizarrely inexpressive characters call to mind the award-winning films of director Yorgos Lanthimos, while the story of doomed youth unable to escape their family’s bloody fate is pure Sophocles.First-time director Piotr Adamski was a conceptual artist before he took up film-making and it shows in Eastern’s precise mise en scène and the success with which it transposes a violent, medieval honour code to a modern Polish suburb. Maja Pankiewicz stars as Ewa Nowak, a young woman called on to defend the family honour when her brother is killed as part of a heavily ritualised vendetta with the neighbouring Kowalskis.This is a source of emasculating shame to her father (Son of Saul’s Marcin Czarnik) – since women are regarded as inferior in this patriarchal society – but a physical disability prevents him from doing the necessary. And it is necessary. Everyone, including Ewa’s intended target, fun-loving teenager Klara Kowalska (Paulina Krzyżanska) understands that. The only way out of their bind is an officially notarised blood-money payment, for which Klara’s mother can’t (or won’t) find the funds.Once you take the human emotion out of it – and there are no wailing widows or enraged mobs in Eastern – the morality of revenge becomes a simple mathematical formulation. Is a grown man’s leg equal in value to a young girl’s life? Can the execution of two daughters cancel out the loss of one beloved son? The film’s answer also seems to contain an indirect comment on the current state of conservative-nationalist politics in Poland. Ultimately, in this world – as in ours – an insult to male pride can be used to justify any manner of slaughter and suffering. Eastern is released on 13 November on digital formats."
Rogue review – it's Megan Fox v stalking lion in an energetic action thriller,Fox leads a mercenary crew against a group of Islamist wildlife poachers in a South African grassland setting that’s more than just an attractive backdrop,3,"If hit Netflix documentary Tiger King had you championing the big cat cause, here’s the animal rights-respecting action-thriller you should watch next. Transformers’ Megan Fox stars as Samantha O’Hara, the gun-toting girl-boss of a mercenary crew in South Africa who must retrieve a high-value hostage from a band of Islamic militants-cum-ivory-poachers. It’s a money-making mission though, not a humanitarian one, and any heroics are performed reluctantly: “If I die because I’m doing the right thing, I’m gonna be so pissed,” says Sam.The action rattles along at a decent pace, punctuated by regular mauling deaths as Sam’s utterly expendable crew hunker down in an abandoned “lion farm”. It’s not just the local al-Shabaab cell that threatens their lives; they’re also being stalked by a lioness gone rogue.Clearly, Fox v Lion was intended to be Rogue’s big, dramatic showdown, but the computer-generated imagery is so pathetic it barely registers; a free augmented reality app could magic up more fearsome predators. Instead, it’s the contrast between Samantha’s dead-eyed, implausibly groomed professionalism and the full-throated compassion of the al-Shabaab leader (Adam Deacon) that intrigues. This is thanks mainly to an energetic performance from Deacon, whom some will remember as a mainstay of British urban drama until his falling out with Kidulthood’s Noel Clarke.Rogue isn’t offering nature-documentary realism, but director MJ Bassett is a former wildlife presenter whose interest in the South African grassland goes beyond mere backdrop. This is explored through the conflicts of Pata (South African star Sisanda Henna), a Maasai tribesman, turned al-Shabaab fighter, turned mercenary. Fox is undoubtedly at the apex of this filmic food chain, but it’s those further down who are enabling it to function. Rogue is available on digital formats."
Hillbilly Elegy review – Glenn Close's grouchy gran saves the day,A troubled teenager ends up at Yale Law School thanks to his eccentric grandmother in this adaptation of JD Vance’s bestselling memoir,2,"Ron Howard’s new movie, based on the bestselling memoir by JD Vance, is a solemn true story of self-betterment from tough beginnings, like the “personal statement” that an American teenager would put on an application to an Ivy League college.It’s not quite an “elegy” because the “hillbilly” world – which is shown as painful, raucous but emotionally authentic – is supposed to be very much alive, as is the hero’s connection with it. And he’s not about to forget his roots. But then again, this hillbilly world (the world of the hill country of Jackson, Kentucky) is something the hero doesn’t have much personal connection with. It’s more the world of his grandparents and great-grandparents. He goes back to their home for family reunions but was born and raised in the less picturesque, equally disadvantaged world of Middletown, Ohio.Owen Asztalos plays JD, a smart, lonely, pudgy kid struggling in a dysfunctional family. His mom Bev (Amy Adams) is a former nurse who is now a drug addict and in a state of open war with her own mother, Mamaw, who is a mean and crotchety old woman, with a violent history of her own (which Howard soft-pedals in flashback to establish her as the film’s plain-speaking moral centre). But Mamaw is fiercely loyal to her kin, a great believer in not snitching to the cops no matter how awful the domestic violence, and willing to take JD into her own house, away from his useless druggie mother and his no-good teen friends, to make sure he gets on with his studies: those very studies that would one day take JD to college, to the US Marine Corps, to Yale Law School and to that privileged position from which he composed his autobiography. (The grownup JD is played by Gabriel Basso.)The book’s subtitle is A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis. Howard erases the critical sense of “crisis” that made the original book a success in political circles. The deadbeat world JD escaped is now regarded more sentimentally.Mamaw is played with very overripe overacting, big glasses, cigarettes and frizzy old-lady hair by Glenn Close, who prefaces every quaintly foul-mouthed outburst (“Kiss my ruby-red asshole!”) with an expression of stunned disbelief at the latest act of laziness or stupidity from her daughter or grandson. I’m not at all sure I really believed in Close in this role, or quite why she needed all those prosthetics, but I did laugh at her acidly unimpressed attitude to JD’s reverence for Native Americans: “They’re called Indians. And they’re not magic, just because they don’t have microwaves.”I’m not sure I entirely believed in Adams either, however earnest her performance undoubtedly is. Bev’s sudden and irresponsible druggie impulse to go rollerskating through the corridors of the hospital that employs her – though very possibly taken from a real anecdote – looks odd and unmotivated on screen. (The inevitable home-movie footage over the closing credits shows how eerily similar to the originals Close and Adams have been made to look.) This is a well-meant story of someone pulling himself up by his bootstraps, with some help from his grandma. But it feels contrived and self-conscious. Hillbilly Elegy is in cinemas from 11 November and on Netflix from 24 November."
Luxor review - beautifully sparse character study amid Egypt's ancient glory,Andrea Riseborough stars as a war-zone medic going through a low-key mid-life crisis as she tries to recover by visiting the famous archaeological site,4,"Slow, delicate and sparse, Luxor is coming out on digital this week just as all the cinemas close down again. If you have a chance to see it, try to view it in the dark, without distractions, on the biggest screen you can in order to approximate a cinema setting and to best appreciate its deep-breath pacing and dry-heat beauty.Writer-director Zeina Durra’s feature, her second after the evocatively titled The Imperialists Are Still Alive!, follows English surgeon Hana (an unusually subdued Andrea Riseborough, giving a great, slow-burn performance) as she recovers from the horrors of working in a Syrian war zone for an aid organisation. As she rests up at a plush hotel in Luxor, the open-air museum of a town in Egypt she used to live in years 20 before, she passes the time visiting the sights and having polite interactions with other guests and tourists, all the while considering what may be an even more traumatic assignment in Yemen.When she runs into an ex-lover, Sultan (a smouldering Karim Saleh), an archaeologist working a dig nearby, the two revive their old friendship and maybe a bit more. But the tentative romance isn’t really the point of this thoughtful study. Through a very studied use of posture, expression and even clumsy stoned dance moves, Riseborough outlines the contours of Hana’s low-key midlife crisis, the contemplation of roads not taken and lives not led, all somehow more present because of the history-steeped ancient setting of the town. Someone mentions at one point that, “the more unstable the world is, the more the supernatural comes to forefront,” which might set up certain expectations for some viewers, but the ghosts here are all strictly theoretical, or at least off-camera.Like director Joanna Hogg, Durra excels at suggesting subtexts and undercurrents threaded through everyday conversations. At all times the dialogue sounds improvised and flows entirely naturally, even when characters are paraphrasing Antonio Gramsci’s ever resonant gloss on historical chaos: “The old world is dying, and the new world struggles to be born: now is the time of monsters.” Classy stuff, and a good way to get in some cinematic tourism to a place no doubt soon to feature in the possibly much trashier Death on the Nile. Released on 6 November on digital formats."
Looted review - car-stealing thriller paints picture of post-industrial decay,"An impressive film about a pair of car thieves in the north of England combines social commentary, poignant drama and lyrical cinematography",4,"Petty criminal Rob (Charley Palmer Rothwell) has a busier schedule than most gainfully employed people in this affecting debut feature from director Rene van Pannevis. He and best mate Leo (Thomas Turgoose) steal cars for profit and pleasure, often with Leo’s giggling girlfriend, Kasia (Morgane Polanski, daughter of director Roman), along for the ride.Life is less of a lark at home, where Rob is the sole carer for his terminally ill father, Oswald (Tom Fisher), a former merchant seaman who has been abandoned to asbestos-related lung disease by his negligent employer. Oswald believes – or perhaps just vainly hopes – that Rob is out looking for work during the days. There’s not much of that about in their small, port-town home (Hartlepool, though it’s never named).All four of these central performances are excellent, but it’s particularly satisfying to see Turgoose, now 28, demonstrate range far beyond the cute quirks and natural charisma he displayed as a child star: there’s something appropriately Joe Pesci-esque about Leo, a character who is by turns mirthful and menacing.Turgoose isn’t the only Shane Meadows echo here. Pannevis has folded a nifty crime thriller into a portrait of the post-industrial, Thatcher-ravaged north of England, which derives much of its tension from just how much you come to care for the characters. Background details are scant, and much of the emotion that passes between father and son is too intense to be spoken aloud. Still, a lot can be conveyed by bickering over oven chips and cassette recorders.The cinematography’s wide expanses of horizon and open sea avoid the grim-up-north cliches and combine poignantly with bedridden Oswald’s wanderlust-filled memories. It’s this kind of political and lyrical film-making that lingers long after Rob’s story has run out of road. Looted is available on digital platforms from 6 November."
Recorder: The Marion Stokes Project review – the woman who kept the TV on for 30 years,"With visionary zeal, the historian/TV producer collected 70,000 hours of television news, creating a unique archive of US life",4,"Here is the strange, but undoubtedly compelling and even heroic story of Marion Stokes, a historian and television producer from Philadelphia who from the late 70s to her death in 2012 made a continuous, unbroken 24/7 video recording of nine TV news stations. She generated a colossal archive of American public life: tens of thousands of videocassettes that had to be stored in nine apartments.This documentary shows Stokes to have the fanatical energy of a hoarder, the zeal of an evangelist and the intensity of a visionary. As a young woman, she was a socialist, fiercely aware of her own status as an African American, which she made the point of debate in the local discussion TV show she produced in the 60s. It was there she met John Stokes, a wealthy white liberal: they married, and it was the second time around for both. Marion’s flash of insight came in the late 70s when she saw how TV news was being revolutionised. With rolling news and the arrival of late-night news programmes, there was simply much, much more being broadcast.Previously, news had been carefully edited and curated by the powers that be for relatively brief programmes: important things happening to important people. Stokes saw that this vast new output would, almost accidentally, show more of the lives of working people and people of colour. She wanted to capture it – like Britain’s Mass Observation Project – and the TV stations were not keeping their own recorded footage.But is this the whole story? Was the Marion Stokes project also a symptom of her own emotional dysfunction? She didn’t just hoard news: it was also books, Apple computers and piles of mouldering old newspapers, and it isn’t clear even from this film if Stokes herself ever rewatched any footage. After her death, the project was handed over to the Internet Archive in San Francisco, which digitised it and made it a searchable archive using the closed-caption subtitling: a resounding vindication of Stokes’s obsessive life’s work.Having watched this documentary, I now think the project could also be seen as a gigantic adventure in conceptual art, and this is not to denigrate it in any way. Recorder: The Marion Stokes Project is available on digital platforms from 6 November."
Love Child review – refugee documentary finds love and warmth amid the misery,"Filmed over six years in Turkey, this is a wonderful account of an Iranian family in exile desperately seeking asylum",4,"Here’s a documentary that gives off warmth like a radiator, generating huge amounts of empathy. I’m not sure I’ve seen another film that has so movingly put the audience in the shoes of a refugee: the emptiness of leaving everything behind, belonging to nowhere, having nothing.“You’re here, but you don’t exist,” says Leila, an English teacher who flees Iran at the start of the film with her partner, Sahand, and their four-year-old son, Mani. Leila and Sahand were both married to other people when they met, and Mani has grown up calling Sahand “uncle”. In Iran their relationship is punishable by death, so they leave to find a normal family life together.Directors Eva Mulvad and Lea Glob filmed the family for six years in Turkey as they waited for the UNHCR to process their application for refugee status. What’s never in doubt is how much they love each other.When the family arrives in Istanbul, they rent a hotel room. Sahand gets a low-paid construction job while Leila stays at home with Mani, whose world has been ripped out from underneath him. He is traumatised and lashes out at Sahand: “I won’t listen to you!” he rages. Leila and Sahand respond to his anger with love and kindness.One of the joys of the film is watching Mani grow up into a sunny, confident boy. From Leila and Sahand’s individual sessions with a psychologist, we learn more of their painful history. Leila’s first husband was a violent drug addict; Sahand was forced to spy on political activists by the Iranian secret service.All the while time drags. Sahand – now working as a teacher – is constantly checking the UNHCR’s website, hitting the refresh button on their asylum case status. They wonder where they might be resettled: Leila hopes for Canada, where she has a friend, while little Mani prays it’s not Australia: “They have crocodiles!”They are a family waiting for their life to begin. Sahand tells his son: “People who want to have a better life have to go through hard times. This is our hard time.” Few live it with such grace. Love Child is available on digital platforms from 6 November."
The Young Observant review – teenage kicks at prestigious Italian waiter school,This docu-fictional hybrid follows a blank-faced and talentless waiter in the ways of swanky silver service,3,"This film is avowedly a docu-fictional hybrid, for which director Davide Maldi has shot fly-on-the-wall nonfiction scenes at a prestigious Italian “silver service” catering college where teenage boys are schooled in the ways of becoming smoothly efficient waiters in white jackets and bow ties. The fictional aspect evidently comes later, with the careful selection and curation of scenes, although this is arguably no more “fictional” a procedure than in any other documentary.It follows Luca Tufano, whose blank, unreadable expression becomes more enigmatic as the film progresses. He is quite obviously terrible at this vocation, at one stage dropping an entire tray of glasses with a deafening crash. But at no point does Tufano talk back, or jeer at his teachers; neither does he look contrite, worried or determined to mend his ways. With a group of other boys, he is told how to lay tables and present food, how to stay alert and be discreetly polite and cheerful, and never to discuss his own views on politics and religion (although the boys are apparently required to attend some sort of creationist religious class as part of the course). They attend hotels and cruise ships where careworn waiters tell them to be on the lookout for different national characteristics at the breakfast buffet (the Spanish are late risers, apparently).All the time Tufano does appear “observant”, to quote the title, though not quite in the way that is required: not on the lookout for customers to please or messes to clean up, but observant in the sense of silently watchful, withholding his own identity as his only way of preserving some self-respect. So perhaps he is a natural waiter after all, and as you look at Tufano’s face, you can’t help pondering – what is his destiny? To be a waiter? Or will he storm out, start a business and become fawned upon by waiters? To anyone who has ever tried to catch a waiter’s eye, one thing these trainees are told is interesting: “Your gaze is your own – it’s up to you to decide when to meet theirs.”The Young Observant is available on Mubi."
"Archive, 1960: Saturday Night and Sunday Morning reviewed",29 November 1960 Karel Reisz’s adaptation of the Alan Sillitoe novel is a genuine human document and a work of film art,0,"Today’s new fashion is tomorrow’s formula and the difficulty which the much heralded Saturday Night and Sunday Morning (at the Warner) has to face is that these youths, the Midland or North-country heroes of John Osborne, John Braine, and, now, Alan Sillitoe, begin to wear a familiar look. The theme of the young and angry begins to be a formula – especially on the screen where fine differences of literary style get smoother away – and young anger is no longer enough in itself; already it needs some new angle, some special claim to novelty or at least to authenticity.That is the difficulty for Karel Reisz’s film of Alan Sillitoe’s novel. It is, by and large, a difficulty triumphantly overcome. There are two reasons for this, and both of them have to do with “authenticity.” Mr Reisz’s scene is set in a factory, in the home, and in the public houses of Nottingham; it is set squarely among the working classes. And this has been done with a most impressively authentic air. Mr Reisz, in fact, has essentially “got it right,” and, since he has done that, he can be forgiven easily enough for having failed here and there to avoid cliche. For instance, the bedroom love scenes of these underprivileged and rather ill-tempered young people are now a kind of convention; and so they appear to be under Mr Reisz’s direction. Again, the fairground scene is a very old gimmick – predating the Osbornes, Braines, and Sillitoes by many years – and in this film its familiar artificiality stands out like a sore thumb, just because so much of the rest is made to seem so natural.The second and even greater reason why the film succeeds is, undoubtedly, Albert Finney. His Arthur Seaton comes entirely alive in time and place; he is a tough young working man, not without brains, not without a special dash of sensibility beneath the toughness, philandering, self-assured (sexually and otherwise), uninhibited except by a certain basic and healthy pride, without any great ambition, but very positive in his intention to enjoy himself and not to be done down by the world – altogether a wholly credible and not completely dislikeable fellow.With Mr Finney to carry the main burden of the acting, excellently supported by everyone and especially by Shirley Anne Field, the film does much more than avoid going wrong. It becomes what, unfussily, it tries to be: a genuine human document and, accordingly, a work of film art. If Mr Reisz cannot take the lion’s share of the credit for this, he has nevertheless done extremely well; he was already known for his documentary We are the Lambeth Boys, but he had not previously made a feature film. It is also fair to note that a dramatic weakness or two in the later stages of the film-story should be debited to Mr Sillitoe himself; he adapted his own novel to the screen."
Rams review – Sam Neill and Michael Caton's unpretentious sheep farmers will move ewe,"Don’t judge this warm, funny, tender and down-to-earth rural drama about odd-couple brothers by its garish marketing materials",4,"The poster for Rams depicts a perturbed-looking Michael Caton next to a smug-looking Sam Neill, both standing behind a sheep, which, like them, is staring into the camera. Going by this advert alone you’d be forgiven for thinking this was a bone-headed comedy about cack-handed country types and their livestock – something with a tagline like “they’re baaaaaad to the bone” or “just ewe and me”.How wrong you would be. Rams is a lovely, even-tempered drama about men and rural life, gentle but firm of spirit, with a down-to-earth pith and a way of entertainingly and unpretentiously exploring potentially difficult subjects such as masculinity. Director Jeremy Sims and screenwriter Jules Duncan faithfully remake the excellent Icelandic film of the same name, which won best film in the Un Certain Regard category at Cannes in 2015 and tells the story of two brothers who live on neighbouring sheep farms but haven’t spoken in many years.In the Australian version, the protagonist Colin (Neill) is the more affable of the pair, a sensible chap with savoir-faire, who gazes upon his cattle with love and reverence, literally telling them how beautiful they are. Les (Caton) is quite the opposite: a stink-eyed “get orf my lawn!” type, with zero patience and a glowering disposition, prone to epic solo drinking sessions followed by marinating while comatose in the sun.Handsomely shot by Steve Arnold in and around Mount Barker in the Great Southern region of Western Australia, with occasional roving drone shots that make the film look a little touristy, much of the drama takes place on the brothers’ farms, the MacGuffin arriving in the form of a terrible disease that infects one of Les’ prize-winning rams. Authorities decree that every sheep in the valley must be killed for the sake of containment, which means, in addition to the brothers losing their livelihood, the potential end of their prized bloodline.A small group of local farmers meet and spitball ideas on how to react, with Les on the side (illustrating his outsider status) kvetching loudly, while preparing himself a scone. “They don’t know, do they?” he bellyaches, “they just come here and–” then he abruptly stops mid-sentence, upon discovering there’s no more cream left in the bowl in front of him.Les never concludes that line. Sims chops the sentence off and lets it linger; lets the silence take hold for a beat or two. Usually scripts deliver neat lines with neat finishes, film-makers turning the loose threads of real-life into smooth contrivances. The incompleteness of this moment gives it something paradoxically interesting: a special kind of mundanity, and an imperfection that suits the film’s earthy tones. It is indicative of an experience that is not going to rush for you. Like the television series Rosehaven, similarly full of country air and wide open spaces, the audience will adjust to its tone and rhythms – and most likely find that adjustment process rewarding.It isn’t clear where the plot of Rams is heading, particularly for those who haven’t seen the Icelandic film. That uninspiring poster, and a wishy-washy trailer stamped with a line of text reading “Where there’s a wool there’s a way” (groan) seems to indicate the brothers might do something to please the gods of genre algorithms, joining forces for instance in some kind of sheep-shearing competition and returning home triumphant, lugging a big golden trophy. But that is not the case at all.Sims has learned from Grímur Hákonarson (who directed the original) important lessons about containing a film tonally, with few of the stark switches between “happy” and “sad” that made his previous feature Last Cab to Darwin a limited, dictatorial experience emotionally. At the heart of the picture are two very appealing performances from Neill and Caton, who feel even from early moments like real, lived-in characters, well cast to reflect their differences as actors. Caton has always been a bit scruffier and Neill a bit slicker. The former is the kind of bloke who eats rissoles and goes to Bonnie Doon for the weekend; the latter looks good in a leather jacket.The “neighbouring brothers who don’t speak to each other” setup could have felt like high-concept gimmickry, but it rings true in a funny sort of way. By contrasting geographic closeness with emotional distance, Sims explores a truth we are all confronted with: that there are certain things – particularly those involving our bloodlines and backgrounds – none of us can ever really escape; things that follow us everywhere even if we never move. In this respect I was reminded of director Clayton Jacobson’s dark comedy Brothers’ Nest, another film about starkly different siblings existing in the shadow of their parents – or in the words of one of the characters, another film about “family shit”.The setup of Rams also develops into an interesting perspective on loneliness and masculinity, with messages blokes in particular may relate to: how men often shrink inside ourselves; how we so easily shy away from expressions of feelings; how we deploy various techniques to shield ourselves from the stabs of memory. See? I told ewe this wasn’t a dopey comedy about sheep. It’s funny at times – but also tender and touching: the cinematic equivalent of a gently moving turn of phrase. Rams is out on 5 February on digital platforms in the UK."
Target Number One review – gritty thriller about Canadian junkie caught in Thai sting,Antoine Olivier Pilon and Josh Hartnett are on good form as a heroin addict caught in police trap and the journalist who reports on the case,3,"Pulpy, structurally a touch otiose, but eminently watchable throughout, this based-on-real-events crime drama tells two entwined stories. One is about a French-Canadian drug addict called Daniel Legér (Antoine Olivier Pilon, from Xavier Dolan’s Mommy), a stand-in for actual historical figure Alain Olivier, who becomes the entrapped fall guy for a disastrous drug sting organised by Vancouver police officers in Thailand. The other half, snipped together via tricksy editing to disguise which events are taking place before the stories converge, is about the determined if showboaty journalist Victor Malarek (a role flatteringly filled by Josh Hartnett) who delved into Legér’s case.As Legér’s appetite for heroin draws him deep into a shady conspiracy involving his shifty boss Glen (comedian Jim Gaffigan) and assorted character actors in ill-fitting plainclothes led by an undercover cop named Cooper (Stephen McHattie, a study in crag and crotchetiness), it gets harder to back out. In a way, the same goes for Malarek, who ends up losing two journalist jobs and – almost – his wife (Amanda Crew) and infant daughter when he gets too close to the truth.Using blanched lighting setups and grainy effects, the film evokes those gritty 1970s true-crime films such as Midnight Express and The French Connection, and that’s always a good thing. Props are due to the production design team who have dug up every rotary phone, cruddy early-80s computer terminal and plasticky office chair needed to populate the newsroom sets and dens of iniquity. Pilon and Hartnett make for sturdy, complementary leads, strong enough to keep you from noticing that they are only ever in two scenes together. Target Number One is on digital formats from 2 November."

Summer of 85 review – gay photolove drama with a dark edge,François Ozon’s period piece about two teenage boys falling in love after a boating incident steers away from profundity,3,"François Ozon gives us a histrionic dose of photolove drama in this watchable if not especially profound young-love heartbreaker, which earnestly insists on the resounding emotional power of Rod Stewart’s classic track Sailing. It’s based on Dance on My Grave, the pioneering YA novel of gay experience by British author Aidan Chambers, published in 1982.This is a very 80s story, and the picture quality has that washed-out summer-faded quality that reminded me of the era’s denim and the films of Eric Rohmer. Félix Lefebvre plays Alex, a teenage boy who comes to a seaside town in Normandy with his parents. One day, while sailing his dinghy, Alex gets into difficulties, and is miraculously saved by David (Benjamin Voisin) a boy Alex’s age who happens to be sailing his own dinghy. There is an instant spark between them and they begin an affair in which David is clearly the dominant partner. Things are complicated when an English au pair, Kate (Philippine Velge) befriends them both, and the story is told in retrospect with Alex in police custody for reasons that are not clear.At first, Summer of 85 seems to occupy a generic Venn-overlap between a summer of sexual awakening, a coming-of-age drama and a dark psychological thriller. Alex at first icily breaks the fourth wall to say something chilling to us directly – a mannerism that is not repeated and misleads us about the nature of the film. As time goes on, it becomes a soapier, soppier tale in which the lovers make solemn oaths to each other to dance on the grave of the one who dies first, a gesture easily misunderstood.In some ways, the older generation upstage the leads. David’s widowed mother is played by Valeria Bruni Tedeschi, who makes something genially eccentric of the role. When Alex is brought dripping wet to the family home after his dinghy mishap, she insists on taking him for a bath, undressing him and then, after a smirk at his nakedness, remarking that his mother can, indeed, be proud of him. Like much of the film, it’s not clear how intentional the absurdity is.Similarly odd is M Lefèvre, played by Melvil Poupaud wearing glasses, horrible clothes and sporting a bald patch. This is Alex’s weirdly predatory literature teacher who encourages his creative writing, and does everything but rub his thighs with his sweaty hands – and is especially keen on Alex’s autobiographical piece about the relationship with David, to whom Lefèvre may have offered a close mentorship the year before. There is tragedy in this story, but the grownup questions of guilt and loss are de-emphasised.Summer of 85 is in cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema from 23 October."
The Secret Garden review – classic kids' tale gets lost in the undergrowth,Frances Hodgson Burnett’s story of an adventurous young girl is overwhelmed by the abundant shrubbery of a garden the size of the Amazon rainforest,2,"In these times of trial, no one could be blamed for a comfort-food yearning, a return to the Sunday teatime world of period drama reassurance featuring blue-chip character actors and national-treasure A-listers in costumes and wigs. This new version of Frances Hodgson Burnett’s 1911 children’s classic The Secret Garden is handsomely produced and earnestly acted, especially by its child star. But it is a Mr Creosote menu of bland nursery food: a giant exercise in family-friendly nostalgia on which no expense has been spared or CGI pixel unused.The Secret Garden – a kind of mawkish and decaffeinated version of Wilde’s The Selfish Giant – is about Mary, a lonely little girl who has to return to the mother country from India when her parents die, and she is forced to stay with her scary widower Uncle Archibald in his remote Yorkshire mansion.But Mary discovers that there is on his estate a marvellous secret walled garden, which Uncle Archibald has locked up ever since his wife died there. Mary scampishly finds her way in and chivvies her uncle’s neurotic disabled son Colin (Mary’s cousin, in fact) to come with her into this garden along with her new friend, the maidservant’s 12-year-old brother, Dickon. Mary uses the secret garden’s miraculous Edenic powers to restore the health of Colin, who had quite wrongly been encouraged to think of himself as bedridden – and the garden promises to be a restorative force, curing the family’s wounds and salving painful memories.And as for the details behind Mary’s aunt tragically dying in the secret garden … er, how exactly? Was it the same sort of gardening accident that carried off Spinal Tap’s first drummer John “Stumpy” Pepys? Well, the film is a tiny bit reticent about the exact moment-by-moment details, and, as with the Spinal Tap case, it is perhaps best left unsolved. We certainly aren’t treated to a ghastly flashback.This movie updates the novel’s action from before the first world war to the tumult of Indian partition in 1947. Mary is played by 14-year-old Dixie Egerickx, and she does bring the right kind of ingenuous, tomboyish confidence and innocent boldness – the way I imagine Lucy Pevensie from the Narnia stories.Mary comes to Yorkshire and on the train journey is confronted by the ferocious housekeeper Mrs Medlock, robustly played by Julie Walters, although without much dialogue for her to get her teeth into. Isis Davies plays the maid Martha, who is sympathetic but will stand for no nonsense; and Amir Wilson plays her brother Dickon. Finally there is the saturnine, miserable and hunchbacked Uncle Archibald, who has something of Heathcliff and Mr Rochester in his DNA – and he is played with a gulped growl by Colin Firth.The mansion itself has been supersized – rather like Manderley in the new Netflix Rebecca – and this movie incidentally adds some comparable melodrama to the house’s destiny as well. It is pretty much the size of Blenheim Palace, surreally marooned in the middle of nowhere. As for the garden, well, the word garden doesn’t really cover it. It appears to be the size of Yorkshire itself or even the Amazon rainforest. This garden is a hothouse fantasy of digital wonderment, to which Mary is introduced by a borderline-irritating laptop-generated robin redbreast. Not quite Narnia, it still seems to be a vast cross between Kew and the legendary Leonardslee Gardens in Sussex, where Michael Powell fabricated South Asia in his Black Narcissus. (It could even be filmed in Leonardslee Gardens.) There is something interesting, arguably, in the Tardis-like experience of getting inside this garden, but it’s still trying very hard to impress.The problem with the story is something that would probably be the same in any adaptation. The character of Colin is so selfish and unattractive that it is difficult to invest or believe in Mary’s attempts to rehabilitate him. He appears to function as a mini-me avatar for the far more interesting and dramatically flavoursome Uncle Archibald whose own woes Mary is having to redeem at one remove – but he is absent for much of the action. This garden is pretty but lifeless. The Secret Garden is in cinemas and on Sky."
Pixie review – Olivia Cooke radiates in Ireland-set drug-heist comedy,"Cooke shines as the title character, a wannabe art student who plans to rob drug-dealing priest Alec Baldwin of a valuable haul",3,"Pixie is her name and trouble is her game. “She won’t just break you, she’ll take a Kalashnikov to your heart,” is the warning at the start of this hectic gangster comedy from St Trinian’s director Barnaby Thompson. It features a strong lead performance from Olivia Cooke as Pixie, the step-daughter of a smalltime gangster in the west of Ireland. She’s written as a 21st-century femme fatale, a woman who uses her brains, beauty and cunning to sucker a succession of chumpish men into helping her rob drug dealers of MDMA with a street value of €1m. Her grand plan is to run away to art school in San Francisco.The tone of the film is Father Ted-meets-Tarantino, with a smattering of Ferris Bueller and In Bruges. There’s a legion of influences here, and what’s on screen is perhaps never quite enough its own thing. But still, there are some genuinely funny moments: the joke underpinning the whole thing is that gangster priests control drugs in the area, and are led by kingpin Father Hector (Alec Baldwin, disappointingly bringing nothing much to the part beyond a splash of Hollywood dazzle). Pixie’s heist involves robbing Father Hector, and when that goes awry, she hits the road with a holdall of MDMA, a body in the boot of the car and two gormless lads from the local pub.Cooke really is terrific, easily carrying the movie with her swallowed-a-lightbulb screen presence. I wondered if naming her character Pixie was a little dig at Hollywood’s Manic Pixie Girl cliche – the female characters who exist only to help men change and grow. By contrast, Pixie is her own woman, out for what she can get: an amoral, selfish free spirit. And yet, is she still a male fantasy? The script, written by the director’s son Preston Thompson, doesn’t do an awful lot to peel away the layers of seductiveness to find the real woman. But maybe it’s just not that kind of film.Pixie is released in cinemas on 23 October."
Antrum review – creepy 'cursed film' mockumentary emanates eerie power,Enterprising film expertly conjures up a supposedly bewitched Bulgarian horror that has killed all those who have watched it,4,"You probably haven’t heard of Antrum, such is the dread and secrecy that surrounds this “cursed film”. And that’s for your own good. Antrum was made in the late 70s and implicated in the mysterious deaths of several film festival programmers and foolhardy horror fans. Now, though, some documentarians have dug up a copy at an estate sale and are sharing it with anyone brave enough to watch.Or so goes the framing narrative of this part-found-footage-part-mockumentary horror. It would be wonderful to stumble across Antrum with little prior knowledge, in a FrightFest-style festival screening, perhaps, or as a midnight movie in your local cinema: remember back when The Blair Witch Project was still a “true story”? Sadly, the pandemic is denying many of us that pleasure, so we might as well openly appreciate the meticulous care that Antrum’s Canadian co-directors have put into fabricating the look of a 40-year-old, low-budget Bulgarian curio, utilising effects both technical and psychological.The premise of the film-within-the-film is fairly straightforward: a brother and sister trek into the woods to the spot where Satan fell to Earth and dig a hole to hell. Lucy Rayner’s plummy narration adds an authoritative air to the “documentary” sections, in which film experts and occultists speculate on the effect that “subsonic frequencies” and sigils scratched on to 35mm film might have on the viewer.Even knowing and appreciating the artifice doesn’t entirely deprive the film of its eerie power. At one point a “legal notice” appears on screen, giving audience members time to exit, if unwilling to accept the risk of “injury, mortal danger or death”. During that unnerving thirty seconds, you may have to reassure yourself it’s all just a very clever hoax… or is it? Antrum is in cinemas from 23 October and on digital formats from 26 October."
Carmilla review – blood lust and mystery mark a superior gothic drama,Jessica Raine stars in this atmospheric adaptation of a Victorian novella ,4,"An atmospheric gothic-tinged period drama, this adaptation of an 1872 novella by Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu flirts with vampiric blood lust but is most satisfying when it delves into the superstition and repression that squeeze the breath out of life for young women like Lara (Hannah Rae) and her uptight governess Miss Fontaine (Jessica Raine). When Carmilla (Devrim Lingnau), a mysterious young woman injured in a carriage crash, joins the household, she unleashes something that could be evil, or could just be female sexuality. But in the eyes of Miss Fontaine and the rural community, the two are pretty much interchangeable. Earthy candlelit interiors and closeups of squirming bugs play tricks on the audience – we are not quite sure whether we are watching something budding or decaying as Lara falls deeper into Carmilla’s thrall.In cinemas"
Rebecca review – perfectly watchable romp,Kristin Scott Thomas is a flawless Mrs Danvers in Ben Wheatley’s conventional take on the Du Maurier classic,3,"It’s not an obvious meeting of material and film-maker, but Ben Wheatley’s Netflix-produced adaptation of Daphne du Maurier’s Rebecca is a perfectly watchable romp that bounces along like a cheerful labrador. It is not, however, immediately obvious where the twisted, at times bracingly weird Wheatley sensibility fits into this rosy-cheeked version of Du Maurier’s tale of sanity under siege (scripted by Jane Goldman, Joe Shrapnel and Anna Waterhouse). We catch a glimpse of it when the new Mrs de Winter (Lily James) stumbles into a below-stairs bacchanal, while upstairs, her own party is an extravagant disaster.Personally, I would have preferred a little more Wheatley edge, a little less Country Living. That said, there’s much to enjoy here. Armie Hammer is perhaps too sunny as Maxim de Winter, but Kristin Scott Thomas is cut-glass perfection as Mrs Danvers, with her bloody gash of crimson lipstick and the silky cruelty in her voice. And the production design is glorious – particularly Rebecca’s sumptuous eau de nil boudoir, its aqueous colour palette hinting at the fate of the first Mrs de Winter even as sense memory of her presence lingers in every room.In cinemas/on Netflix from 21 Oct"
Uncle Vanya review – coronavirus gives Chekhov a shot in the arm,The pandemic supercharges the atmosphere in this film version of Ian Rickson’s recent stage production,5,"Here is an extraordinary, transfiguring leap from stage to screen. Ian Rickson’s production of Uncle Vanya was cut short by lockdown in the final weeks of its run. Now, in collaboration with director Ross MacGibbon, he has not merely captured his original staging but dazzlingly reinterpreted it. This is not, like the NTLive broadcasts, an attempt to transmit a theatrical event. It is a new thing. The film crackles with fresh intensity – and gains new shadows from the timing of its release.Chekhov’s 1899 play is prefaced by shots of the cast arriving – dungarees and masks – at the Harold Pinter theatre for the first time since March: shaking out umbrellas, walking into an empty auditorium. As the action begins, something extraordinary happens. We are transplanted in time and place – there is nothing 21st-century British about Rae Smith’s lofty, crumbling design, the sodden glimmer of Bruno Poet’s lighting or old Nana with her long dark dress and bun, patiently waiting on everyone. Yet the stage is charged with the climate of Covid-19. That combination of sluggishness and highly tuned irritability, the feeling of time mysteriously slipping by, maliciously cheating people of their lives, is everywhere: in Toby Jones’s crosspatch, crumpled Vanya and Rosalind Eleazar’s Yelena, so heavy with disappointment she is scarcely able to move. The lassitude of Chekhov’s characters is sometimes spoken of as if it were a mental elegance: here, it is plainly toxic; everyone might be hung over after a too-long afternoon nap.When I saw this on stage in February the use of direct address to the audience struck me as too blunt. Filmed close-ups banish this difficulty - it is as if we have a direct wire into the speakers’ brains. The strong original cast is enhanced by the addition of Roger Allam, effortlessly condescending as the pampered professor. In this sharp modern version by Conor McPherson, the environmental alarm of the play is more startling than ever. It is often said that an elderly play is nevertheless a play for today. This one truly is.Susannah Clapp is the Observer’s theatre critic. Visit unclevanyaplay.com for cinema screenings"
The Kid Detective review – cutesy crime caper takes a dark left turn,The OC’s Adam Brody gives a strong performance as a man coasting on former glories who gets a brutal awakening in an unusual genre-flipping tale,4,"Within the framework of any good mystery is a well-modulated supply of red herrings, designed to wrongfoot us and the detective we’re watching, ideally enough to intrigue rather than irritate. In writer-director Evan Morgan’s unusual neo-noir The Kid Detective, it’s not just a suspect or a motive that’s a red herring, it’s an entire genre, a strange rug-pull of a movie that starts in the middle of the road before ending up off a cliff, in a way that both works and doesn’t, a fascinating gambit nonetheless.We begin the film in a candy-coloured small town, a Sundance movie universe a whisker away from being too twee, where the improbably named Abe Applebaum (The OC’s Adam Brody) is living in the shadow of his former self. As the title suggests, he was a kid detective, gaining local fame at a young age for solving low-stakes mysteries, from a missing cat to stolen charity money, charming and impressing those around with his precocious pluck. When a local girl goes missing, Abe’s pre-teen skills understandably come up short and years later, he’s a local joke, the town drunk, an adult detective whose business has dried up. But when a high-school student asks him to find out who killed her boyfriend, he spots a chance for redemption.Appearing out of nowhere, a theatrical release stateside announced with just a week to spare and a rushed trailer shoved out just days before, there’s something oddly well-suited to The Kid Detective’s jolt of an arrival. Morgan’s buzz-free buzz-kill will probably take its small audience by surprise, sight unseen, and for optimal viewing purposes, purists might prefer a total avoidance of specifics concerning the film’s dark tonal shift. But while not knowing that a shift is coming might make it all the more effective for some, there’s an argument to be made that even the slightest of forewarning will make a great deal of what comes before it that much easier to consume. Because while there’s a certain throwaway charm to watching Brody pleasantly shamble his way through what feels like a late 90s indie (it plays like a shaggy, if less potent, riff on Zero Effect at times although a prolonged setpiece involving a closet is incredibly, uniquely funny), there’s also a “Sure, what else?” overfamiliarity to the material, a slightness that makes it hard to deeply invest in what’s sleepily unfolding in front of us.But in the last 20 minutes, Morgan wakes us up with a sharp left turn concerning both the nature of Abe’s investigation and the nature of Abe himself. It’s not exactly a twist per se but more of a step back to see the bigger, bleaker picture, the gentle quirkiness of the first act fading fast, the cutesy all-American facade of the town curdling into ugliness. What’s most surprising about the finale is how Morgan takes us to the brink and then leaves us there. After a reveal of startling nastiness, he softly skirts around a happy ending before, in a dour last scene, defiantly refusing to give us one. It’s almost too abrupt, with a beat or two missing, to truly land, but I admired its audacity and then how unsettled I felt after, like realising at a later age what really happened to your childhood pet who was “sent away to a farm”. Abe’s reheated slacker antics are reframed with a sudden depth and Brody’s performance works so well because of our limited expectations of him as an actor and the uncomfortable arc he shares with his character: of someone whose fame faded with age.It’s a surprisingly deft turn in an odd little film that might not hit every high note but its diligent avoidance of ending up where we expect it to makes it hard to shake, a disquieting crime drama where solving the mystery isn’t enough to make things better.The Kid Detective is out in selected cinemas in the US on 16 October with a UK date to be announced"
Soul review – Pixar's rapturous tale of a jazz nut on a surreal out-of-body journey,"There’s not much logic involved in this weird and wonderful story of a pianist who is accidentally transported to a strange, otherworldly domain",5,"Here is Pixar’s charming, bewildering and beautiful new animation about life after death and life before death – and that title incidentally reminds you how we got the word “animation”. It’s a free-jazz fantasia about a sad and lonely musician, with globules of Frank Capra, 60s psychedelia, 80s body-swap and an old-fashioned stairway to heaven that put me in mind of Pressburger and Powell.But the keynote is pure Pixar: that intense, childlike, ever-renewing rapture that inside all of us, there is this secret existence and identity that the outside world knows nothing about.The story is a deeply strange and complicated one: a where-are-we-going-with-this journey that occasionally messes with the rules of narrative and character consistency. But it makes its own kind of sense when the film arrives at a mysteriously moving epiphany: a montage of moments and glimpses that hint at an existence higher than the one in which we are following our all-important showbiz dream.Soul initially seems to indicate that the choice is between the glories of being a famous jazz musician and the selfless heroism of being a great teacher. But the story ultimately (and enigmatically) gestures at the idea that this is a false choice, or no choice at all, and that we are looking in the wrong direction. And it’s all in that swirling constellation of images. I didn’t think it was possible to be moved – really moved – by the simple image of night-time New York with its lights bordering Central Park’s vast rectangle of darkness. But that’s what happens in this weird, lovable story, directed by Pixar’s Pete Docter and written by Docter, Mike Jones and Kemp Powers. (Powers is also credited as co-director.)Our hero is Joe (voiced by Jamie Foxx), a tired, middle-aged, African-American guy in New York whose passion is jazz, a calling to which he has evidently sacrificed his personal life: he is now single and still taking his laundry to his elderly mother who runs a tailoring and alteration business.Nowadays, poor Joe earns a few bucks with a part-time job teaching band at a high school, but still yearns to play jazz piano in front of an adoring, connoisseur crowd. But just when he is faced with finally abandoning his jazz dream in favour of a bittersweet Mr Chips destiny of inspiring young people, a former student of Joe’s gets him the chance to play with one of the most famous jazz musicians in the world.And just when Joe’s life could hardly get more dramatic, he falls down a manhole, loses consciousness and enters a strange otherworld domain, a quasi-heaven existing both before and after and during death, in which this spectral “Joe” is expected to mentor an errant, brattish, not-yet-born soul called simply 22 (voiced by Tina Fey). So what can soul-Joe and 22 do but go back to Earth, alighting in comatose body-Joe’s hospital bed; 22 accidentally invades Joe’s body and soul-Joe invades the “therapy cat” which the hospital authorities have placed on his bed, in the hope that its furry ministrations would awaken him. So Joe and 22 take off across New York in the wrong bodies, on a mission to get Joe that jazz gig.And their adventures can sometimes get even more confusing. When 22 speaks to Joe’s buddies through Joe’s mouth but with her own voice nobody seems to notice. Perhaps the convention is that they hear Joe’s voice – but we, the audience, hear 22’s to remind us what’s going on. But later when they confront Joe’s stern mother, 22 speaks with Joe’s voice at last and appears to intuit what he would say.It’s all very headspinning, and there is real Yellow Submarine quality to the film’s innocent urgency and idealism which take it to the very brink of incoherence. That can sometimes be exasperating but also really captivating, especially in that final visual cadenza in which Docter and Powers are really are going above and beyond the traditional Hollywood ending. It’s a deeply sweet, happy, gentle film.Soul screened at the London film festival, and will be available on 25 December on Disney+. It is in UK cinemas from 8 March."
Welcome to the Blumhouse: Nocturne/Evil Eye review – dark desires,Twin sisters vie for musical supremacy and an arranged marriage gets the supernatural treatment in the horror company’s collaborations with Amazon,0,"Kicking off the second batch of Welcome to the Blumhouse, the horror outfit’s collaboration with Amazon, Nocturne (★★★★☆) is played firmly in the key of Black Swan, and it is a confident interpretation. The setting isn’t ballet, but an elite music academy where out-of-sorts pianist Juliet (Sydney Sweeney) looks sure to be eclipsed by her outgoing twin (Madison Iseman) in a competition to decide the school’s year-end concerto soloist. Then she stumbles on a notebook – covered in esoteric scrawls depicting a satanic pact – that belonged to the competition’s original winner, who recently jumped off her balcony. Juliet is suddenly fired up to take on Saint-Saëns’ Piano Concerto No 2, aiming to gazump her sister, who is playing the same piece. It’s the most sanity-threatening keyboard pick since Rachmaninov’s Third in Shine.British debut director Zu Quirke doesn’t skimp in her duel of the doppelgangers. She chucks in everything from untimely menstruation to boyfriend hijacking to a sadistic but suave maestro (Ivan Shaw), à la Red Shoes, who seems to exist to stoke Juliet’s dark desires. “Music is a bloodsport,” he says.Sweeney sometimes overplays her crescendo scenes, but is effective in quieter stretches, brimming with sour-faced ill intent. It gives space for the refined timbre built up by Quirke: from an opening, beautifully lit suicide scene reminiscent of Park Chan-wook’s florid moments, to the edgy sound design. Nocturne is simpatico with a protagonist who, in lieu of greatness, decides to steal – then play it like she owns it. An elegant, forking finale proves as much.Welcome to the Blumhouse has so far upheld the company’s impressive record on diversity-minded casting and story choices, from Get Out to the recent “Hasidic horror” The Vigil. But Evil Eye (★★☆☆☆) shows that representation alone isn’t enough. Twin-brother directors Elan and Rajeev Dassani bed a supernatural-tinged thriller in the practice of Indian arranged marriage: New Delhi matriarch Usha (Sarita Choudhury) frets across the time zones about her daughter Pallavi’s (Sunita Mani) matrimonial prospects in California. But Usha isn’t happy when Pallavi meets sensitive tech bro Sandeep (Omar Maskati); despite the fact he ticks every box going, the mother is convinced his family’s women are bound to inescapable tragedy.It initially feels as if Evil Eye is going to overplay its Hindu cultural angle. But it plays cat and mouse with cliches about Indian superstitions, suggesting there may be a secular explanation for Usha’s fears. The trickiness here is the source material: Madhuri Shekar’s audio play, which was told almost entirely in phone conversations and voicemails. It does not translate naturally to the screen, imposing a tension-sapping metronomic alternation between scenes set in India and the US, and dialogue-heavy slugging matches between mother and daughter drag the film deep into the melodrama zone. With scant visual bite, perhaps it should’ve been called Evil Ear. Nocturne and Evil Eye are on Amazon Prime Video from 13 October."
To the End of the World by Rupert Everett review – witty memoir of a Wilde life,"In a sharp, scabrous account of his lifelong love of Oscar, the actor again proves himself a masterly writer",0,"Rupert Everett was five years old when he first heard the name Oscar Wilde. Tucked up in bed beneath the gables of a pink farmhouse somewhere in deepest Essex, on the night in question his mother had broken off from her pre-dinner party beautifications to read to him. The story she chose was one of those Wilde wrote for children, The Happy Prince, and it quickly cast a spell on her son. When they reached its end a week later, the boy was in floods of tears for all that he didn’t quite understand, then, its inner morality (“Dear little swallow,” said the Prince, “you tell me of marvellous things, but more marvellous than anything is the suffering of men and women”). This was, as Everett writes, an “audacious move” on the part of his mother, perhaps her single greatest contribution to his emotional development: “It is here that I learn for the first time that there is a thing called love and that it usually has a price.”Everett’s new memoir, his third, is the story of his enduring obsession with Wilde and how it compelled him to make a film about the doomed writer, a decade-long quest that, though ultimately successful, brought him, at points, to the edge of reason. It begins with a fat suit that comes with “baboon moobs and a marvellous knee-length arse” (even in middle age, Everett is somewhat less fleshy than poor old Wilde) and ends somewhere a lot less slapstick, its author finally finding peace, of a kind, in a room at the Sunset Tower hotel in West Hollywood. In between, it is just about everything you could want, at least in a memoir by an actor. We know, by now, that Everett is a deliciously gifted writer. Nothing and no one escapes his attention and in this book he’s as good on Laurellee and Mary Jay, a couple of forward American tourists he meets on a night train to Rome, as he is on Luise Rainer and Gregory Peck (see also Joan Collins and Christopher Biggins). But there’s something else here, too: a plangency and depth of feeling that may do strange things to all the images you have of him in your head (to be honest, I have had images of Rupert Everett in my head ever since the sixth form, when I first saw him in Another Country).Whether he is describing a pair of Naples staircases, sagging in a courtyard like “the laces of old stays”, or trying to imagine what it might have been like to be Wilde’s long-suffering wife (“One look into Oscar’s eyes must have told a sensitive woman like Constance that he had gone. But where? She must have felt herself waning”), the feeling grows in the reader that he can do anything. I would, for instance, rather read Everett on the faded pleasures of a grand old Venice hotel than any so-called travel writer, up to and including Bruce Chatwin. His great trick is that, unlike the Leichner makeup he favoured as a young man, he does not lay it on with a trowel. When he undercuts his sincerity – tenderness is always hotly pursued by a barb – it only serves to make his narrative the more heartfelt. (“Syphilis probably, but at the thrilling stage,” he notes, finally, of a moment when, about to go on stage as Wilde in a production of David Hare’s play The Judas Kiss, he suddenly has the sense that “the whole universe has stopped in its tracks”.)The day-to-day business of film-making can be tedious on the page, all budgets and cranes and infuriating directors of photography. But Everett makes it vivid, his (sometimes) craven inadequacies as a first-time director – his film about Wilde’s tragic last years, The Happy Prince, was released, to moderate acclaim, in 2018 – a vibrating lid on the boiling pot of his “minor-league Heaven’s Gate”. Acting is next to impossible to write about without sounding like a pretentious fool, but somehow, he does it. “At other times he appears quite vacant, which I think is an essential quality for film acting,” he writes of Edwin Thomas, who plays Wilde’s friend Robbie Ross in the movie.It goes without saying that To the End of the World is funny and scabrous. But since very few showbusiness denizens are prepared to be as honest as he is about all the ways in which it will never love you back, the book’s most powerful undertow is inevitably valedictory. Everett is old, he insists, and “the wrong kind of queen”; Hollywood has zipped itself up and turned its back on him. Does this mean that we worry for him? Do we picture him, just occasionally, as the leather Norma Desmond? No, never. However wasteful and capricious his first profession, we know that he is perfectly safe. The blank page will henceforth always be his. He is a writer to his (aching) bones. To the End of the World by Rupert Everett is published by Little, Brown (£2o).

To the End of the World by Rupert Everett review – a delightful writer on modern fame,"Chatting up Thierry Henry, being sick on Colin Firth ... and the saga of an obsession with Oscar Wilde, told in this third memoir with Everett’s usual seductive style",0,"There are, for reasons both simple and obvious, certain literary figures who inspire a kind of hero worship that invariably says a lot more about the worshippers than it does the heroes. Charles Dickens obsessives often fancy that they share their idol’s famed energy and brilliance, or at least faintly reflect it. The wan young women who adore Sylvia Plath ignore her happy poems about domestic bliss and focus instead on the angrier, sadder parts of her work. Oscar Wilde obsessives go that one step further: they don’t just understand Wilde – they are Wilde, with all the wit and woe such a package entails. Stephen Fry went through a Wilde phase, and Rupert Everett has been going through one for some time.This has been more to the audience’s benefit than Everett’s: he was wonderful on stage as Wilde in The Judas Kiss in 2012, and The Happy Prince, the 2018 film he wrote, directed and starred in about Wilde’s last days, is excellent. Easily the most thoughtful and least gilded depiction of Wilde yet, the film is far from the self-indulgent exercise in narcissism for Everett it could have been.That, however, is something of a miracle, judging from this memoir about the time leading up to and including the making of the movie. “I am Oscar Wilde,” Everett writes after yet another epiphanic moment, which generally involves him going somewhere Wilde visited, once. Chance encounters – meeting Wilde’s grandson, learning that his own aunt had a connection to Wilde’s son – are taken by Everett as deeply significant, as such things are when one is in the grip of an obsessive love.Yet it is hard to write sensibly, let alone enjoyably, when deep in a myopic mania; Wilde himself barely pulled it off with De Profundis. Given how much Everett hobbles himself in this book, wasting what his friend Philip Prowse correctly describes as “all that energy” on channeling Wilde and Lord Alfred Douglas (“They are both such fucking bores, dear. I know you love them but honestly …”), he manages pretty well. The joy of Everett as a writer has always been his pitilessly clear-eyed perspective, especially of himself; the one requisite of a fan is the loss of all objectivity. As bedfellows, these two qualities are as complicated as Wilde and Douglas.Everett is probably as well known now for his writing as he is for his acting, a comment that he will probably take as a slur on the latter, judging from the rueful pleasure he indulges in these days in seeing his well-filled glass as bone dry. “My career has definitely hit the ‘where are they now’ category,” he writes, when just a glance at his packed IMDB page suggests otherwise. But the more recent projects often feel to him like a step down: when he’s being bussed out to the set of the BBC’s The Musketeers, he muses: “It’s not very chic being in a people carrier.”In any case, Everett has become one of the most delightful writers about modern fame. His previous memoirs, the raucous Red Carpets and Other Banana Skins, followed by the more autumnal Vanished Years, were beady, indiscreet and witty, as one might have expected. More surprising was how beautifully they were written, poignant but with an emphasis on faded beauty rather than simple sentimentality. Here he is in the new book on the joys of train travel: “Once I am on the tracks and the past falls behind, I experience a kind of weightless ecstasy, a sloshed affection for the world, which looks best from a passing train. Even one’s problems achieve a kind of fin de siècle glamour.”Whether Everett is remembering the time he drunkenly tried to chat up Thierry Henry (“What team do you play for? Arsehole? Great answer …”), or recalling Lychee, the transgender sex worker he hung around with decades ago in Paris (“At a certain point she only has to look at a motorbike and she falls off. After six years on the game she is a chipped china doll”), he is someone that you want to spend time with. He has a writing style as seductive as his youthful beauty.In 2007 he decided to write a screenplay about Wilde: “If the only role I was permitted to play was the gay best friend, then I would take it all the way back to the prototype.” Initially, all looks promising and Hollywood producer Scott Rudin wants to produce his script, with the great and now late Philip Seymour Hoffman playing Wilde. In an act of self-sabotage that is frankly Wildean in proportions, Everett insists only he can play Wilde. And so the project duly collapses.But Everett keeps it alive, barely, for the next decade, powered by his increasingly tortured obsession with it, and helped by loyal actor friends who agree to appear in film for, it eventually transpires, little to no pay. At one point, he goes to Colin Firth’s house and tearfully begs him to be in the movie and a somewhat bemused Firth agrees. During one of their scenes together, Everett muses on how things have changed since they starred in Another Country, 35 years earlier: “Then I was the up-and-coming star perched on a windowsill wielding a pair of binoculars. Now he is in the ascendency and I am the beached whale on the deathbed.”He is a hoot on the absurdities of film-making (“I have just puked all over Colin, but my heart’s not really in it. No matter. It’s amazing what one can do with a bottle of Guinness”), as well as the indignity of his deflating ego. He never quite gains similar perspective over his devotion to Wilde or this film. “Is this a desperate last-ditch ego trip or divine intervention?” he wonders, and he doesn’t ever resolve this himself (others may have their own theory).Quite how seriously the reader takes Everett’s somewhat agonised relationship with Wilde probably depends on their tolerance for literary hero worship. Mine is fairly low, but every sentence Everett writes rings with his personality, and it’s a personality that has always been irresistible. And hell, the film is great, so maybe it was worth it in the end. At some point, it would be quite amusing to have someone else’s take on Everett’s Wilde phase – Firth’s, say, who expresses concern for his friend during the extremely fraught film shoot: “Are you OK?” he asks. “You look a bit done in.” “I’m acting!” Everett snaps back at Firth, and then adds as an aside to the reader: ‘You have to act … like everything is running smoothly.’ Wilde would have approved.

Akira review – apocalyptic anime's startling message of global annihilation,The landmark Japanese cyberpunk animation from 1988 re-emerges as a deeply strange nightmare about destruction and rebirth,4,"A deeply strange message from the future is what this movie is here to (re)deliver: both post- and pre-apocalyptic, a nuclear-age parable of anxiety to compare with Godzilla. Akira, released in 1988, is the cult Japanese cyberpunk animation from director Katsuhiro Ôtomo, who also created the original manga serial. (It is set in the impossibly futuristic year of 2019, so maybe last year would actually have been the time to rerelease it.)Thirty years on from a devastating explosion that razed the city, a new capital – Neo-Tokyo – has been born: sprawling, chaotic, like the LA of Blade Runner. The city is beset with violence from warring motorbike gangs, and by protesters rioting against unfair taxes. A hatchet-faced army officer says that Neo-Tokyo is “a garbage heap made of hedonistic fools”.Biker teen Kaneda (voiced by Mitsuo Iwata) is in the middle of a confrontation with a rival mob, when his friend Tetsuo (Nozomu Sasaki) accidentally crashes into a bizarrely wizened child-goblin figure who has apparently escaped from a top-secret government research facility investigating this race of troll-infants with bizarre powers.Tetsuo finds that he himself now has staggering telekinetic abilities, and becomes public enemy number one for these sinister G-men. He assumes superhuman qualities, evolving into a new entity, a virtual messianic figure for this occult race of uniquely gifted or cursed lab rats. It is Tetsuo’s destiny to discover the truth about Akira, a much-rumoured godhead or wellspring of essential cosmic power that is to be found somewhere underneath the city: it may have been responsible for the explosion 30 years ago.And so the final 30 minutes of the film build to a nightmare of utter destruction – longed-for destruction, in fact, an annihilation that will wipe out this culpable, wretched world. Akira’s strangeness is very startling and sometimes bewildering. But there is a thanatonic rapture to its vision of a whole world ending and being reborn as something else. Akira is released in cinemas 7-9 October."
Growing Up with I Spit on Your Grave review – gruesome 'video nasty' gets family treatment,The son of the director of the notorious rape-revenge thriller attempts to open a discussion over a film that has both its detractors and admirers,2,"The infamous 1978 exploitation-revenge flick I Spit on Your Grave – one-time “video nasty” and chosen by critic Roger Ebert as his all-time worst film – now gets a lengthy retrospective and reappraisal here courtesy of its director Meir Zarchi’s son, Terry. Perhaps the current febrile atmosphere – split between rampant online misogyny and strident #MeToo calls – is the right moment.Zarchi Sr is nonplussed in being asked to justify the 30 minutes of gang rape; he describes his film, with its second-half procession of wince-making retribution slayings, as simply “biblical – an eye for an eye”. Whether Terry Zarchi is persistent, or sophisticated enough, in questioning that belief is another thing.The director and cast were upset when, after struggling to sell the film, distributor Jerry Gross changed its title from Day of the Woman and sexed up the new poster (with Demi Moore, rather than actor Camille Keaton, supposedly providing the image). Which makes you wonder what kind of film they thought they were making. This is not high art, even if the sheer crudeness of staging and performance is what gives the film its brutish glow, and inflamed its critics. Zarchi Jr, though, has an unfortunate tendency to treat it like Tarkovsky. Detailing every nook and cranny of the production, the documentary is longer than the original film.Terry Zarchi may be right in drawing attention to the fact that such female-revenge narratives were unusual at the time, running counter to the reality that rape was often not taken seriously by the authorities – including the incident that Zarchi Sr says inspired him to to make the film, when, in the early 70s, he rescued a girl who staggered out of a New York park after being sexually assaulted. Now they are a familiar trope, from Kill Bill to Coralie Fargeat’s Revenge.Whether or not these films constitute feminism is a debate still raging. Zarchi Jr doesn’t fully prise open the discussion, leaving it to a panel of viewers – fans and detractors – to cast their ballots. (His attempt at impartiality is undermined by the family love-in tone he increasingly adopts, including towards Keaton for whom his father left his mother.) The rape survivor who is vociferously pro-Spit probably gets the deciding vote. Growing Up With I Spit on Your Grave is available on digital formats."
Welcome to the Blumhouse: The Lie/Black Box review – subtle scares,The horror hit factory creeps on to streaming platform Amazon with two studies in psychological unsettlement,0,"Blumhouse, the production outfit founded by Jason Blum, struck it big with unquiet souls terrorising American domesticity in Paranormal Activity – and not much has changed 11 years later, as the company launches Welcome to the Blumhouse, a diffusion line of eight thrillers in collaboration with Amazon Studios. (Four are released this year, four in 2021.) Here, the unquiet souls are the domestic inhabitants themselves – at least that’s the case in these first two films, which slot more into the psychological thriller category than the pure horror the studio is known for.Veena Sud (showrunner of the US remake of The Killing) offers an accomplished helicopter-parenting noir in The Lie (★★★★☆) – though what beleaguered divorcees Mireille Enos and Peter Sarsgaard engage in when trying to shield their daughter (Joey King) after she murders a schoolmate is probably better described as Black Hawk Down parenting. Sud – with plenty of inexorable tracking shots through the family’s chilly condo – efficiently tightens the screw as the twitchy mother and indulgent father first bicker, then are doomed together by their blood allegiances.In fact, the couple are so blinkered in protecting their offspring that it prevents The Lie from entering more psychologically torn territory that might have made it profound. Instead it’s merely car-crash compelling. Sarsgaard – an actor who often feels like a John Malkovich/Philip Seymour Hoffman crossbreed – can do this kind of equivocating mess in his sleep. But the standout here is Enos: a rictus of scarlet lipstick topped with a battery of compulsive twitches.Less classical but somehow more derivative is Black Box (★★★☆☆), which makes you wonder if Blumhouse is using its TV arm as a dumping ground for concepts that don’t quite make the cinematic cut. There are echoes of Get Out’s Sunken Place in the cutting-edge hypnosis treatment that road accident victim Nolan (Mamoudou Athie) is prescribed to recover his memories. The good doctor (Phylicia Rashad) is sweet-tongued but wearing enough maroon eyeshadow to flag that she shouldn’t be trusted.Faintly redolent of Inception, the therapy triggers unsettling flashbacks filled with blank-faced bystanders and a spider-walking revenant straight out of a J-horror flick. This pageantry registers less than the simple psychological tension that builds – and is ably maintained by debut director Emmanuel Osei-Kuffour and his largely African American cast – as Nolan questions his identity.But Osei-Kuffour – not helped by Athie’s rather stiff presence – can’t fully sell a crucial midway twist that pulls the focus away from the intriguing dynamic between a dependent father and a young daughter forced to grow up prematurely (a promising performance by Amanda Christine). Without any real stylisation to shake up Nolan’s inner realities beyond bog-standard techno-realism, this sunken place has no strong signature of its own – and little to add to the African American experience.The Lie and Black Box are available on Amazon Prime Video from 6 October"
Miss Virginia review – shallow biopic fails to do its subject justice,Uzo Aduba has all the talent to play activist Virginia Walden gets but is let down a script uninterested in the issues it depicts,2,"Uzo Aduba has just picked up a well-deserved Emmy for playing the pioneering African American congresswoman Shirley Chisholm in Mrs America. Now she is on the other side of Washington DC, as the struggling single parent turned education reform activist Virginia Walden.In early scenes, Virginia drags her weary frame through school metal detectors to urgent parent-teacher conferences about her 15-year-old son. Then it’s on to meetings with the bank to plead for loans to pay for private school and her second job cleaning toilets at a congresswoman’s office. On the horizon, the Capitol dome gleams, contrasting with crumbling, graffitied buildings of Walden’s neighbourhood, a simplistic shorthand for DC’s notorious inequalities. The cliched choreography of a school-bully fight scene – they round on the class nerd and trample his glasses – is also typical of this film’s surface-skimming depiction of social problems.Eventually Virginia meets Congressman Clifford Williams (a wild-haired Matthew Modine), who sells her on a system of private school tuition vouchers, which he says has worked elsewhere. This, they insist, is nothing to do with “politics” and “all about the kids”. But they are ignoring the role that poverty and de facto segregation play in a failing education system, while proposing private schools for a lucky few as a solution. Surely that is political?Those who object swell the ranks of film’s villains. They are careerists such as Lorraine Townsend (played by Aunjanue Ellis and supposedly based on the real-life Democrat politician Eleanor Holmes Norton), or burned-out schoolteachers, or drug dealers motivated only by pantomime malevolence (The Wire this is not). Sure, biopics of living subjects require a careful balance, but if Miss Virginia couldn’t find a way to include some analysis alongside all its admiration, why bother?Available on digital platforms from 5 October."
Rialto review – raw emotional power fuels a punishing character study,Tom Vaughan-Lawlor excels in this bleak Dublin-set drama about a closeted gay man whose life is unravelling,3,"Peter Mackie Burns’s painful, unhappy drama packs a hard punch; you must steel yourself for the emotional blows. Tom Vaughan-Lawlor is excellent as 46-year-old Colm, a Dublin man who looks like a working-class success: nice house, office job at a dockyard, lovely wife and teenage kids. But Colm is secretly gay, and living with the shame for so long has scraped his insides out. There’s nothing left of him: he is drinking heavily, barely functioning, pushing away his concerned wife Claire (Monica Dolan, bringing real emotional depth to the smallish role).One day Colm ends up in the men’s toilets of a shopping centre with a teenage sex worker, Jay (Tom Glynn-Carney, whose spiky bleached hair and reckless swagger recall Sick Boy from Trainspotting). Afterwards Jay shows up at Colm’s work demanding more money: €200 or he’ll tell his wife and boss. “Do you want me to shame you? I can shame you.” Actually, Jay turns out to be not a master blackmailer but a messed-up kid living a chaotic life. Nevertheless, Colm has pushed the button marked “self-destruct” and is in freefall.The script is a reworking by Mark O’Halloran of his play Trade, a two-hander featuring Colm and Jay set in a B&B. But some the most affecting scenes in the film are set at home with Colm and his family. He furiously necks cans of cheap lager watching his wife and kids from a distance – he feels like he doesn’t deserve any of the happiness. The emotional detail is impressive, though at times I found Colm’s self-hate difficult to watch. Time may heal, but not in the lifetime of this film.In UK cinemas from 2 October."
Terminal Sud review – powerful dispatch from a civil war,Ramzy Bedia is captivating as a charismatic doctor in this French-Algerian drama about a country descending into chaos,3,"French-Algerian film-maker Rabah Ameur-Zaïmeche sends us a dispatch from a civil war with Terminal Sud, an intriguing, somewhat abstract drama about a country descending into chaos. The facts on the ground here seem to tally with the Algerian civil war of the 90s, the so called “black decade” that claimed more than 100,000 lives. But the film was mostly shot in southern France, and Ameur-Zaïmeche doesn’t hide contemporary details such as mobiles and new-model SUVs. He has said in interviews that the point is to make it universal: this could happen any time, anywhere. The approach isn’t entirely convincing, and the unfocused sense of time and place is a bit distracting and frustrating at times. But there is real power to many of the scenes.The film is told in fragments as an oppressive government strengthens its grip. It opens with a minibus stopped at a military checkpoint, the passengers held up and robbed. By soldiers or a rebel group disguised in army uniforms? Who knows. The city is a wild west. Men in balaclavas drive around in unmarked vans gunning down journalists and dragging suspects off the streets. The camera’s attention is often drawn unexpectedly away from the main event. When a man is tortured in a military prison, Ameur-Zaïmeche spends as much time watching the torturer limber up – psyching himself up like an athlete – as he does on the interrogation.Holding all these moments together is a deeply charismatic, towering performance by French comedian Ramzy Bedia. There are other doctors in the rundown hospital where he works, but he is the Doctor, a great slab of man built like a farmer, gentle and tender with his patients. He tells everyone that he is neutral but then death threats arrive. The film gathers in force the more time he is in front of the camera.Available on Mubi from 5 October."
The Glorias review – Gloria Steinem biopic is a laughably shoddy mess,Julie Taymor’s film on the multiple life stages of the defining feminist turns what should be a fascinating character study into an embarrassing disaster,1,"It takes less than a minute into The Glorias, the director Julie Taymor’s shallow biopic of the feminist icon Gloria Steinem, to realize something is off. Four iterations of Steinem at different ages – child (Ryan Kiera Armstrong), teen (Lulu Wilson), young woman (Alicia Vikander), and middle-aged (Julianne Moore) – sit on an old Greyhound bus going … somewhere, each shaded a strange and uncomfortably wan gray against the colorful scenery out the window. Why edit half the scene in color, half in black and white, like the early iPhoto effects of the mid-2000s? There doesn’t seem to be a reason other than to gesture at depth – one of many baffling artistic choices that turn a nearly two-and-a-half-hour film on what should be a fascinating, mettlesome, complicated character study into an uneven, trite and at times laughably shoddy mess.Steinem’s long life and career (she is now 86 years old) as a journalist, second-wave feminist leader and the co-founder of Ms Magazine in 1972 has been trailblazing and often heroic, if not immune to critique. There is vast material for an exploration of shifting American womanhood and the contradictions of activism within and outside of institutions. But instead of meaningful conflict, The Glorias, based on Steinem’s 2015 memoir My Life on the Road, presents Steinem as an unerring and widely appealing hero, one who can drop into a bar in South Dakota, as Moore’s iteration does in the film’s opening minutes, and receive praise from a female biker for inspiring her to “take to the road on my own” before speeding away in the reflection of Steinem’s signature aviator shades.The rest of The Glorias is similarly obvious and cloying while also shifting wildly in tone. The screenplay by Taymor and Sarah Ruhl splices scenes from Steinem’s life into a narrative whose general trajectory is chronological but seesaws awkwardly between the years. The young Steinem, book-hungry and observant, is close with her father, Leo (Timothy Hutton) an itinerant and unreliable antiques dealer who keeps the family on the move. As a teenager, Steinem cares for her mother (Enid Graham), an invalid struggling with mental illness, in Toledo, Ohio, after Leo abandons the family for the open road. The pain from this period occasionally leaks into an overlong stretch of time in which a miscast Vikander plays Steinem as a recent college graduate in India and later intrepid young writer in New York with a jarringly bad attempt at Steinem’s midwestern accent, flat but with none of the heartiness. Moore plays some of the feminist movement’s greatest iconographic hits – the 1977 National Women’s Conference, the first issue of Ms Magazine – as the fully grown Steinem.All four versions of Steinem commingle, in that uncomfortable black and white, on the bus to nowhere, for grimace-inducing scenes which serve to make broad thematic statements. The conceit of a character communing with her past ghosts is not an inherently cringey one – HBO’s The Tale successfully provoked unsettling admissions of complicity and the revisions of memory by pitting different-aged versions of its main character against herself. The Glorias’ main conceit of multiple Steinems feels, by contrast, like a shallow gimmick whose potential is squandered by bizarre directing choices – one scene that commutes anger into a red-hued, poorly executed Wizard of Oz tornado dream sequence made me cackle out loud.It’s a shame, because the bantering of The Glorias has at its core a worthwhile message: that a woman can grow into owning her choices, and can synthesize her personal experiences into a coherent, expansive political philosophy. That’s a good faith reading of a project that I would like to believe was intended to do more than just lionize its star by sanding down her real, human complications. The lost opportunity is highlighted by Mrs America, a show released earlier this year, which reanimates the feminism culture wars of the 1970s with nuance. Mrs America’s Steinem, played guilelessly by Rose Byrne, falters in judgment, grapples with her notoriety and instinctive press magnetism, and learns from the thorny gaps between the utopian vision of Ms Magazine and its actual environment for black and queer editors.The Glorias, by contrast, glosses over the intense and generative intersectional conflicts within the feminist movement in favor of an inhumanly rosy fantasy: a collection of diverse women standing around a table, laughing and agreeing with one another. Most insidiously, it recasts Steinem’s hard-won political evolution into a hero’s journey of magical discoveries, in which she absorbs an intersectional approach through boldly stated themes said by people of color, then exhibits her exceptionalism by merely listening. Black feminist leaders such as Dorothy Pitman Hughes (Janelle Monáe) and Flo Kennedy (Lorraine Toussaint), labor rights leader Dolores Huerta (Monica Sanchez), and Native American activist and real-life best friend Wilma Mankiller (Kimberly Guerrero) serve merely as imparters of wisdom quickly huddled under Steinem’s star power rather than complicating, sparring minds of their own.Another film might have mined Steinem’s remarkable life for its complications and contradictions, but The Glorias settles for slapdash iconography – Steinem picks out her signature aviators because as a saleswoman laments they “hide your beautiful face”, and declares “Martin Luther King is leading his civil rights march on Washington. I want to cover it!”The nowhere bus, ultimately, colors in with a sea of pink “pussy’ hats and the real Steinem, en route to the 2017 Women’s March in Washington – a genuinely inspiring show of feminist activism whose many rough edges and various hues are, like Steinem’s biography in The Glorias, leached of their power in favor of an easy story.The Glorias is available on Amazon Prime in the US from 30 September with a UK date to be announced"
Say Your Prayers review – goofy Christian hitman comedy,"Smart pacing, sharp editing and classy cameos elevate this Yorkshire-set tale above many recent crime capers",3,"The team behind 2016’s eye-catching indie Chubby Funny – producer Helen Simmons and director Harry Michell – return with another agreeably off-beam comedy, this time with a starrier cast and a goofy, Four Lions-ish premise. It’s the tale of sibling Christian hitmen who, envious of the column inches logged by rival fundamentalists, set out to kill a Dawkins-like author at a literary festival in Ilkley.Tim (Harry Melling) is the childlike younger brother, ill-suited to grisly murder; the uptight Vic (Tom Brooke) an unrepentant sociopath. Their target (Roger Allam, master of glib dismissiveness) need not worry unduly: an astutely timed prologue shows our would-be ruthless killers stalking a rambler who looks just enough like Allam for the first of several terrible mistakes to be made.The pacing of that opening instantly elevates Michell’s film over a half-dozen recent British crime-comedies. We’re heading towards a set-piece that’s the Yorkshire Britpic equivalent of Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation’s opera-house assassination, while the gags allow supporting players to dig in and make an impression. Anna Maxwell Martin is formidably sarky as a detective aghast at having to enter the artsy-fartsy literary scene; Derek Jacobi has a classy cameo as a priest who justifies the hit with chilly mouthfuls of scripture; Matthew Steer’s brisk, funny sketch of the spineless festival chief will likely cue cringes of recognition in some quarters.Having the action observed by a roving male voice choir – representing the C of E’s safe centre ground – looks like a cheeky crib from the Icelandic hit Woman at War, but it’s a solid evening’s entertainment, assembled with an assurance rare at this budgetary level. Norwegian-born cinematographer Sverre Sørdal provides attractive glimpses of the moors (still under-utilised as a Britfilm resource), while sharp editing serves both the comedy and thriller aspects. Simmons and Michell, blessed with good ideas and the craft to do them justice, are building a notable filmography on the margins: let’s hope the industry’s moneymen are watching. Say Your Prayers is on digital platforms from 28 September."
Southern Journey (Revisited) review – on the road to America's soul,This talkative documentary retraces the steps of pioneering musicologists Alan Lomax and Shirley Collins 60 years on,3,"‘Relevant today more than ever,” says one interviewee in Southern Journey (Revisited), pointing out his Easy Rider pin badge. “Man went looking for America and couldn’t find it nowhere.” But this roving, loquacious documentary does its damn best to pin down the American soul, going on a road trip through Virginia, Kentucky and Mississippi in the tracks of ethnomusicologists Alan Lomax and Shirley Collins on their 1959 “Southern Journey” in search of the south’s musical traditions.Directors Rob Curry and Tim Plester are ostensibly about the music. Their first porch stop is with a Salem, Virginia woman whose dark, purposeful eyes are a spitter for her grandmother: Appalachian balladeer Texas Gladden, who was doorstepped by Lomax 60 years ago. There are heart-stopping performances, and we are apprised of the odd informational gem, such as the fact that the beat for MC Hammer’s Can’t Touch This is drawn from Mississippi’s fife and drum music. But the film quickly spirals into a broader survey of southern culture, as the tension and culture wars of the 2018 midterm elections smoulder in the background.For music that draws so richly on the textures of everyday lives, it makes sense for the film to let itself be drawn in this direction. The continuities in people’s concerns aren’t all welcome. One Mississippi gospel singer reflects on Lomax being an exception to the rule of exploiting black musicians. Another, in her beautiful house, on the effect on her life of her great-grandfather becoming her town’s first black landowner.The new Southern Journey – with a quilted-together oral form – makes a staunch defence of this history of immigration and the dispossessed. But this allegiance means it doesn’t fully grapple with the Maga mainstream who feel they own this culture and are entitled to police it. A melancholy sense of a broken and post-lapsarian America – that in the words of Easy Rider, “We blew it, Billy” – is easier. It’s a thought-provoking journey all the same. Southern Journey (Revisited) is in cinemas from 25 September."
"Schemers review – the rise and rise of Dave Mclean, rock promoter",One boy’s climb from disco organiser to Scottish entertainment kingpin – directed by the man himself – contains battered sausages but needed more bite,2,"This account of the rise of Dundee music promoter Dave Mclean, later to become the UK’s tireless ambassador for grunge, is directed by Dave Mclean, produced by Dave Mclean and co-written by Dave Mclean; at least the film doesn’t shy away from the chutzpah of the vanity project. As his younger self progresses from on-the-fly student discos to a dicey triumph via sweet-talking Iron Maiden to play Dundee’s Caird Hall in June 1980, Mclean ramps up this account of Tayside wheeler-dealing with abundant freeze-frames and a street-sprint intro that leave no doubt which modern Scottish classic it is emulating.“Davie” (played with smiling self-assurance by Conor Berry) is helped on his way by small-time dealer Scot (Sean Connor) and homebody DJ John (Grant Robert Keelan). Their badinage flows naturally from a script with a wry enjoyment of local idiosyncrasies (like the chip-shop scene in which Davie measures out the mileage from London to Dundee using a battered sausage as a ruler) that doesn’t skimp on entertainment in the early stages.The lack of objectivity is finally fatal though. As Davie makes underworld alliances with local kingpin Fergie to further his ambitions, it never feels like Mclean fully fleshes out the consequences, or is prepared to examine the roots of his gambler’s compulsion. Trying to keep in the running with Trainspotting just shows up Schemers’ inferior emotional range. Not possessing Danny Boyle’s expert snap and rhythm is not a crime for a debut film-maker, but Mclean just isn’t invested in characters beyond how they service his own story. The hagiographic fumes finally induce an annoying mania in most of the performances, as the film, like his schemes, threatens to collapse in the Iron Maiden stretch. The character postscripts – including Scot’s mysterious death in 2014 following shady Russian property deals – hint at more testing material that might get more out of Mclean. Schemers is in cinemas from 25 September."
Little Girl review – a brave child's journey to her true self,"In this illuminating and moving documentary, seven-year-old Sasha questions her gender – and challenges prejudice",4,"Seven-year-old Sasha lives in provincial France, loves ballet classes, dolls, dresses and her family. She may have been born male, but she’s known at least since she was four that she’s really a girl. Luckily, her mother, Karine, completely supports her child and, together with Dad and the Sasha’s four loving siblings, the family embarks on a process of transition. This involves, among many other daunting steps, visiting a psychiatrist specialising in gender dysphoria in Paris to discuss the situation, including whether (when the time comes) to use hormone treatment as puberty starts, managing friendships and, most importantly, persuading Sasha’s school to recognise her as a girl. That last step appears not to go so well due to a more conventional school principal, but Sasha and her parents persist.This extraordinary documentary by director Sebastien Lifshitz, who has made many films about the LGBTQ+ experience (Wild Side, Bambi, Open Bodies), achieves a remarkable degree of intimacy with its young subject and her family. Getting up close and personal through tightly focused, limpid cinematography by Paul Guilhaume, the film allows us to study every flicker of expression on the faces of Sasha and the adults around her.Their anguish when the situation gets rocky is painfully visible, although the vérité style, eschewing any editorialising or narrational guidance, leaves room for viewers to interpret things differently. Are the parents and professionals pushing Sasha a little too hard to settle on a gender identity? Does it have to be such a binary choice? And the whole issue of puberty blockers, still very contentious, is only glancingly discussed. But what’s not in question is the vast empathy and affection Sasha’s parents feel for her, and that’s reflected in the empathy Lifshitz and his crew extend in turn to them, ultimately making this a very illuminating, trans-positive work. In cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema."
Magical Adventures in the Forbidden City review – steampunk fantasy hints at allegory,"Entrancing effects, but dubbed-sounding voices and wooden acting tip this movie into the bizarre",3,"Something of a curate’s Fabergé egg, this peculiar Russian-made steampunk-lite fantasy feature has some interesting story ideas, entrancing visual effects and lovely sets (a lot of it was filmed in Tallinn’s gorgeous city centre in Estonia, as well as in St Petersburg). But many of the lead performances are painfully inert, exuding less verisimilitude than the story’s computer-generated fairies. Just to guide it deeper into the valley of the uncanny, nearly everyone in the film speaks English but with obviously dubbed voices, so while the phonemes roughly match the mouth movements, it’s a fair bet that different actors (often with American accents) recorded the dialogue in soundproof booths during post-production. That said, this last weirdness creates a kind of verfremdungseffekt, or sense of alienation, which dilutes any remaining realism and thus may be intentional.We can be pretty sure that director Aleksandr Boguslavskiy and his collaborators fully intended to create a magical world that looks all at once medieval, belle époque and 1930s-ish. There, the residents of a town called Fensington live inside a high wall designed to keep them safe from supposedly sinister strangers, a bit like a Maga-hat fantasy version of Yuma, Arizona, but smaller and with more snow. Nearly a hundred years after the wall was built, a father (Eddie Marsan) gives his young daughter a necklace that turns out to have strange powers before he is taken away by officers wearing creepy bronze masks who claim that he is “infected” with some enigmatic disease. The girl, Abigail, grows up to be willowy, wooden-as-a-countertop ex-model Tinatin Dalakishvili, who then falls in with a group of resistance fighters.With masked soldiers snatching civilians in Belarus and the continuing conflict in Ukraine, it’s temping to spy some kind of anti-fascism allegory in this story, but that may be taking things too far. Sometimes a zeppelin is just a zeppelin.Magical Adventures in the Forbidden City is released on DVD and digital platforms from 21 September."
The Man in the Hat review – whimsical French car chase,France looks beautiful from a Fiat 500 in this picturesque fantasy about a man on the (very slow) run,3,"The English composer Stephen Warbeck won an Oscar for his work on Shakespeare in Love, but has never directed a film before. He makes his writer-director debut, in collaboration with John-Paul Davidson (director of various Michael Palin and Stephen Fry-fronted travelogues) on this whimsical road movie that has little dialogue but plenty of music. Ciarán Hinds stars as the titular hat-wearer, who we meet dining on razor clams and rosé at an empty harbourside restaurant, with only a framed photograph of an unnamed woman for company. He inadvertently witnesses some apparent criminal activity and makes a quick escape in a Fiat 500 (the photo carefully placed on the passenger seat), followed by five angry men in their Citroën Dyane.So begins a picturesque odyssey across the French countryside, the best Provençal driving holiday you’ve never had. It’s a car chase, technically, but a slow one. Certainly, the sense of peril is insufficient to prevent both the pursued and his pursuers from stopping off for a good lunch whenever the mood strikes. And should they happen upon a live jazz band in a charming little town square, or a stranger singing an impromptu opera aria, what’s to stop them just sitting there in the late afternoon sun for a while?All this enjoyment of la belle vie leaves little time for slapstick, but The Man in the Hat is, in any case, more socially adept than his silent comedy forebears. He’s a sensitive listener (Hinds, utilising those melancholy eyes) and the people he meets along the road – the Damp Man (Stephen Dillane), the Biker (Maïwenn) – seem comfortable sharing their own tales of love and loss. It’s a Francophile fantasy that may be too twee for some, but the French tourist board will surely be satisfied.The Man in the Hat is released in cinemas on 18 September."
Barking Dogs Never Bite review – Bong Joon-ho’s canine satire has teeth,"Lazy, corrupt humans are doing the biting in the Parasite director’s re-released 2000 film",4,"Bong Joon-ho’s black-comic satire Barking Dogs Never Bite has been re-released after 20 years, and in many ways it could be seen as a thematic forerunner to his Oscar-winning hit Parasite, with its vision of strange people and strange secrets in a basement. But it’s entirely distinctive on its own (bizarre) terms: a film about animal cruelty (loosely inspired by the 19th-century children’s novel A Dog of Flanders by Marie Louise de la Ramée, perennially popular in Korea) and it begins with a huge “no animals were harmed” disclaimer. As well it might. The various moments of dog-jeopardy and dog-distress will have you hiding under your seat – and a certain dog rescue scene is like something out of The Shining.Lee Sung-jae plays Yun-ju, a hapless postgrad student with a pregnant partner. The pair live in a crumbling apartment building whose front doors open outwards – which is to be important in one chase scene. Yun-ju’s worries are compounded when he realises that he is expected to pay a hefty bribe to the elderly faculty professor to get a tenure-track job.The combination of financial anxiety and disillusionment triggers a mental breakdown and he becomes obsessed with a dog in a neighbouring flat whose incessant barking is driving him mad. He decides he has no choice but to kill the unfortunate animal. In fact, his misdeeds are to involve three dogs and bring him into fateful contact with an administrator called Hyun-nam (Bae Doona) who has to press an official stamp on all “Lost Dog” notices. The movie is by turns wacky, farcical and grimly realist. The dogs might bark, but the ones doing the biting are the humans: the lazy, venal, corrupt, depressed, greedy people who have no one but themselves to blame for living a dog’s life.Barking Dogs Never Bite is available online through Curzon Home Cinema from Friday, and screens on Saturday at Camden Market in London."
Residue review – haunting drama on the dangers of gentrification,A visually striking and timely film from first-time writer-director Merawi Gerima sees a film-maker returning to an unrecognisable DC neighbourhood,5,"Residue is a fleeting and haunting lament for what is lost to gentrification, and other tolls on black life in America. But at the same, it’s exhilarating and monumental, laced with the sensation that we’re discovering a bold and sensitive new voice.Writer and director Merawi Gerima’s debut, released by Ava DuVernay’s independent film collective Array, tells a prodigal son story, about a man returning to his old stomping grounds. And in that story, Gerima experiments with performance and vérité, intimate narrative and poetic abstractions. His artistry is thoughtful. But more than anything, it’s emotional.Gerima comes from black film-making royalty. His father is Haile Gerima, the Bush Mama and Sankofa director who collaborated in the late 60s with fellow black UCLA graduates like Charles Burnett and Julie Dash. There are traces of Burnett’s Killer of Sheep in Residue, as well as Spike Lee’s Do the Right Thing. That’s just one way the past echoes throughout the young Gerima’s debut.We can assume the film’s lead character is fashioned after the young director himself, at least on a practical level. Obi Nwachukwu plays Jay, a film-maker who travels from Los Angeles to Washington DC. He wants to make a movie about DC’s Q Street, his childhood home and the friends he used to roam with.Residue’s grave terms are spoken early on. A disembodied voiceover asks whether Jay’s camera is a weapon trying to save the community or whether the film-maker is actually an archaeologist coming to unearth bones from the concrete. As if resigned to the inevitable, the film documents black culture in the city as if it needs to be fossilized on camera. The opening is a rush of images and sounds from a DC block party. The black community dances on the street while local rap group CCB’s Roll Call bumps on the soundtrack. Then come the police and white residents walking their dogs. That prologue sums things up.Upon arriving in his old neighbourhood, Jay is “greeted” by a white resident who tells him to turn down the volume on his truck stereo. That command is followed by a loaded warning should he not comply: “Don’t make me have to call the cops.”For sale signs litter the street. Realtors leave repeat voicemails at Jay’s parents’ house, eagerly offering cash for their home. Jay lurches through the neighborhood, his brow permanently furrowed, as if he’s blinded by all the whiteness he’s seeing. But Gerima purposefully obscures white faces or keeps them out of frame. Unlike these neighborhoods, his film centres black people.Jay searches for friends at the homes or on the corners or stoops they once occupied. Some moved. Others are locked up. The spaces in Residue feel full with absence. They carry memories, and the film has a hypnotic way of slipping in and out of them. At times, scenes have an impressionistic autumn sheen that borders on antique, like the present is rushing to become the past. At others, they have that 16mm grain or digital video motion smoothing. Residue’s aesthetic is as nimble as its state of mind. Moments fade into muffled memories and one memory bleeds into another. People too are violently turned into memories. And like Jay, we desperately search for something or someone to hold on to.Gerima does a lot with a little. And he’s supported by an exceptional cast made up of mostly non-professional actors who, put simply, own these roles. In the most powerful scenes, the performers are quiet, using their eyes and breathing to communicate feelings, anxieties and empathy. They show an understanding among black men that some words just don’t need to be spoken.Dennis Lindsey is a standout among them. His Delonte is a survivor hardened by experience. He’s suspicious of Jay, whose probing questions come off as opportunistic. When Jay tries to explain that he wants to make a film to give a voice to the voiceless, Delonte snaps back, guardedly: “Who’s voiceless?” Delonte sounds hostile and looks distant, but there’s an unforgettable sense of guarded warmth in Lindsey’s performance. And there’s overwhelming guilt rattling around in Nwachukwu’s Jay, which perhaps belongs to Gerima. At the very least, it suggests the film-maker’s cognizance of his own privilege and his relationship to a space that he left behind.Despite spending his childhood on Q Street, Jay is as much an intruding presence as the new residents who dubbed the area “Noma”. His subsequent emotions are messy and complicated. Gerima wades through them confidently. His film doesn’t say much that hasn’t already been said in work by Burnett and Lee. But as the racial reckoning of the past few months made clear, these issues persist. And Gerima explores new ways to dwell on them. If nothing else, the feelings he drums up in Residue linger.Residue is released in select cinemas and on Netflix in the US from 17 September with a UK date to be announced"
Penguin Bloom review – Naomi Watts saved by a magpie in charming drama,An Australian family moves on from tragedy with the help of a bird in a modest and warm-hearted true story,3,"Naomi Watts, an adept and at times electrifying actor, has found herself adrift in recent years. The star who shone bright in Mulholland Drive and King Kong has dimmed with each rotten project, from the disastrous schmaltz of The Book of Henry (a film so bad it was rumoured to have cost director Colin Trevorrow a Star Wars gig), to Gus Van Sant’s maudlin suicide mystery The Sea of Trees (a film that was met with a chorus of boos at Cannes) to clumsy, barely released trans drama 3 Generations. Even her small-screen projects have underwhelmed, whether it be the swiftly cancelled Netflix thriller Gypsy or her role as Gretchen Carlson in the buzz-free Fox News drama The Loudest Voice that was quickly overshadowed by Bombshell (her Game of Thrones prequel was cancelled after a poorly received pilot). It’s frustrating to watch, given what we know she’s capable of, and so with each new performance, fingers remain cautiously crossed.Penguin Bloom, a modest Australian drama premiering at this year’s semi-virtual Toronto film festival, is by no means a slam-dunk – it’s slight and has notable flaws – but it’s a minor, much-needed victory for Watts, a charming crowd-pleaser that at a normal at-capacity premiere would have led to hearty applause. Based on a true story and the book it inspired, it’s the tale of a family recovering from tragedy. While on vacation in Thailand, Sam (Watts) suffers a devastating fall, one that leaves her mostly paralysed from a spinal cord injury and after arriving back home, she struggles to acclimate to an intimidatingly unknowable new normal. How can she be a functioning and reactive mother to her three young children when she has to rely on her husband (Andrew Lincoln) to help her out of bed? How can she remain hopeful for a future when her options seem so limited? As Sam falls deeper into despair, there’s an unlikely new addition to the family.When one of her sons brings home an injured magpie on the beach, naming her Penguin, Sam bristles at the disruption but she slowly develops a strange attachment to the bird and realises that if Penguin can recover then in some way, maybe she can too.Like the symbolism at its centre, it’s not a particularly subtle film but on its own simple terms, it’s one that mostly works. Sam’s tentative connection to Penguin is believably choreographed, echoing her desire to care for her children, to look after a creature even more vulnerable than she is and through some slick wrangling, we can sense a growing chemistry between them. The bird itself is hard to resist, tottering around as if slightly inebriated, winning us over at the same time as the Bloom family, sneakily stealing innumerable scenes from the human cast. That’s also partly because they’re a little too thinly etched to read as real, messy, fully fleshed-out people and at times the characters could just as easily be named Mum, Dad and Sons 1-3. The film leaps almost straight into tragedy so the director, Glendyn Ivin, relies heavily on voiceover to tell us about pre-accident times and instead of showing us a lot of the relationships, we’re told about them instead.The marriage in particular lacks genuine specificity and Irvin, along with Snowtown screenwriter Shaun Grant, shies away from some of the more interesting nuances that are briefly hinted at with regards to an impossible balance of power. Lincoln has little to do other than tighten his jaw and quietly weep but Watts serves an impressive and, given recent history, important reminder of just how effortlessly she’s able to eschew the trappings of movie stardom to embody a believable everywoman. As mentioned, the characterisation might be thin but she works hard to fill in the gaps and we’re refreshingly spared any predictable histrionics, a far subtler performance than the film often deserves.The broad strokes are also made more forgivable by Sam Chiplin’s gorgeous cinematography, which carries us all the way to the coast in New South Wales, a swift, sun-drenched vacation coming at an opportune time. It’s a handsomely made and sturdy little movie, mercifully devoid of cloying sentimentality, an old-fashioned throwback for families in search of something safe and superhero-free that might not sing quite as loud as it could have but flies just about high enough nonetheless.Penguin Bloom is showing at the Toronto film festival with a release date yet to be announced"
The Broken Hearts Gallery review – one to fall in love with,Geraldine Viswanathan’s goofball heroine delights in Natalie Krinsky’s cheesy yet irresistible New York romcom,4,"After being dumped and fired, gallery assistant Lucy (Geraldine Viswanathan) drunkenly climbs into the wrong silver Prius, thinking it’s her Uber. Its owner, a handsome hotel developer named Nick (Dacre Montgomery), is so charmed he drives her home anyway. This meet-cute begets a blossoming friendship and the pair start hanging out in Nick’s half-finished boutique hotel (“I’m building a place that feels like the spots I fell in love with when I first moved to New York,” he says without irony of its faux-hipster aesthetic). Seeing potential, self-proclaimed “emotional hoarder” Lucy convinces him to let her curate an exhibition of donated heartbreak memorabilia on its mezzanine floor, inspired by the mementos she’s kept from her own exes.The premise of writer Natalie Krinsky’s directorial debut sounds cheesy, and it is, but watching the brooding Nick softening to putty in our goofball heroine’s presence while she remains sparkily oblivious is an earnest pleasure. Viswanathan’s swagger was the highlight of 2018’s teen comedy Blockers. She channels that same extroverted energy here, as do protective best friends Nadine (Hamilton’s Phillipa Soo), a lesbian lothario with a weakness for Russian models, and the bossy, grumpy Amanda (Molly Gordon) with a silent, live-in boyfriend who knows he’s best seen and not heard."
David Byrne's American Utopia review – Spike Lee's thrilling treat for fans,A filmed version of the musician’s hit Broadway show plays like a vibrant greatest hits extravaganza that could win converts,4,"Spike Lee has made a filmed record of David Byrne’s Broadway stage-show version of his solo album American Utopia, a live reimagining of the record in which a lavish selection of his classic tracks with Talking Heads is also performed. So many, in fact, that it almost feels like a greatest hits extravaganza. Psycho Killer is excluded, but there are plenty of absolute bangers from yesteryear, and from an early stage in the proceedings, you can see members of the Broadway audience in the front row standing up and rocking out: people who have perhaps grown old with the great man himself and allowed their own hair to become as snowy as his. (Byrne looks more like Jim Jarmusch with each passing year.)Byrne affects a conventional grey suit on stage, and his backing band of singers and dancers wear the same thing, perhaps to create a cloning effect. Inevitably, it will remind Byrne fans of the “big suit” he wore for the Stop Making Sense concert movie directed by Jonathan Demme in 1984 and there are similarities, although this show, like the suit, is consciously a more scaled-down, intimate affair.There is one overt eccentricity or informality: no shoes. (I found myself thinking of the lyric from Houses in Motion: “Wearing shoes without socks / In cold weather …” although it’s an inexact comparison.) Byrne and his band look as if the stage has somehow been accidentally flooded and they are making the best of it. But it’s amazing how quickly you accustom yourself to his quirks.The choreography by Annie-B Parson is absolutely right for Byrne’s angular, noodling, wacky dance style, and his supporting cast rather cleverly project the air of people who are basically musicians called upon to perform a well-drilled dance routine, without any special pizzazz, but everything is brought off with perfect synchronicity and charm.And the hits keep coming: Don’t Worry About the Government (a song about an old person that now has an added piquancy), This Must Be the Place, Once in a Lifetime, Glass, Concrete and Stone, I Zimbra, Born Under Punches and many more. In addition, Byrne is concerned that his music and this show is not just a matter of white people’s art-rock. There is a tribute to the NFL star and civil rights activist Colin Kaepernick, and Byrne also does a tremendous cover verson of Janelle Monáe’s Hell You Talmabout, in which the singer demands the audience say the names of the black people who have been killed after a confrontation with the authorities.Byrne maintains his even-tempered enigma: with his little headset-mic, he does short Ted-talk-type monologues between the tracks, and these are diverting enough but of course the music itself is what we’ve come for. Afterwards, Lee’s camera follows Byrne off the stage out into the wings and to the dressing room where he hugs and high-fives his colleagues – no star liggers backstage, though, sadly. And then we see him get on his bike and cycle home, exactly as Alan Bennett used to do after a hard night’s performing at the National Theatre in London. There is no moment where Byrne dramatically opens up, either on stage or off, but perhaps that’s not the point. It’s a treat for Byrne fans, and could well make converts.David Byrne’s American Utopia screened at the Toronto film festival and is available in the UK on digital formats on 14 December and DVD on 11 January."
Monday review – hedonistic romance drama is a party worth avoiding,Sebastian Stan and Denise Gough have zero chemistry as a couple dealing with a series of uninteresting relationship crises in a disappointing drama,2,"Four years ago, the Greek film-maker Argyris Papadimitropoulos made a vivid impression with Suntan: a bleakly hilarious Death-In-Venice-type affair set in a seaside resort, featuring a sad middle-aged man who tortures himself with his tragic infatuation with a beautiful young woman on holiday.Here is his follow-up, in the English language, featuring Sebastian Stan (Bucky Barnes from Marvel’s Captain America movies) and the Irish stage star Denise Gough, with a script co-written by the director with the award-winning British dramatist Rob Hayes (who worked with Michaela Coel on the TV comedy Chewing Gum). Sadly, despite all the talent involved, this is a disappointment: an unconvincing, undeveloped and emotionally directionless non-drama that just goes pointlessly around and around in circles. All of this film’s various moods – erotic, euphoric, tragic – are unearned and despite what is clearly strenuous effort from the performers themselves, the acting is hammy and undirected.It is the story of a love-at-first-sight passion which has to face up to the tough reality of maintaining a relationship once the initial sexy rush is over: in other words, dealing with the “Monday” comedown following the “Friday” of carefree weekend partying. The movie is in fact pointedly divided into a series of sections each repeatedly labelled “Friday” leading to what is evidently to be the deferred “Monday” reckoning. But bafflingly, the relationship in question seems to be always facing terrible crises and brutal Mondays long before this, yet after some shouting and then some carefree laughing, the reset button gets miraculously hit. It is a story which seems to be weirdly without penalty, without emotional consequence.Stan plays Mickey, an American guy in a Greek resort who is earning a living DJing in clubs and composing ad jingles, living a bleary hedonist lifestyle but secretly concerned about the serious musical career he self-sabotaged back in the US and the fact that he never gets to see his six-year-old son from a previous relationship with a Greek woman. Then at a party, he meets Chloe (Gough), a smart, sexy American lawyer who is just coming out of a painful situation with an abusive man. The spark is dazzling. They have nonstop wild sex, leading to waking up naked together on a beach and getting arrested – but it’s all just swept up in the uproarious swirl of their passion. But then they have to deal with their demons: namely, the sinister man that Chloe left behind and the fact that Mickey still has to have a difficult conversation with his ex-partner to get access to his son – a conversation which he leaves to Chloe, like the emotionally avoidant guy that he is.For me, this tense conversation between Chloe and Mickey’s ex-partner Aspa (played by Elli Tringou, who was the bewitchingly unattainable woman in Suntan) is the one moment in the film that truly comes to life. It is the one speck of grit in the oyster, the one scene where something seems to be really at stake, where things can happen with irreversible results. And so it proves – in a way. Aspa icily confronts Chloe with the truth about how lazy and selfish Mickey actually is, but seems to have taken stock of how serious Chloe is.Everything but the kitchen sink is thrown into this film: parties, clubs, arguments, embarrassments, sex – and there’s even a full-on romcom rush to the airport. But I never got the impression of a genuine connection between the two stars. There was no chemistry. Gough works hard to make her role count, but she has not much to work with, and Stan is stuck with this exuberant, anarchic hipster role which reminded me weirdly of the cool Rat Pack guy with whom Alicia Silverstone has her terrible date in Clueless. The party feels like it’s over before it’s begun.Monday is showing at the Toronto film festival with a release date yet to be announced"
The Tomb: Devil’s Revenge review – Shatner cursed in Indiana Jones-like horror,No opportunity for deadweight exposition or cornball reversals goes unexplored as William Shatner attempts to destroy an ancient jinxed relic in this bizarre horror-thriller,1,"William Shatner has banked a lot of goodwill down the years, but he may find himself in sudden arrears. His involvement presumably made this lamentable horror-thriller viable. The Tomb: Devil’s Revenge displays similar levels of coherency to his legendarily expansive acting style. Shatner plays Hayes, a hard-ass military patriarch ball-busting his archaeologist son, John (Jason Brooks), to track down and destroy an ancient relic that has landed the family with a curse “more powerful than anything anyone has ever encountered”. Don’t ask too many questions.After an initial unsuccessful descent into the cave where the gizmo is hidden, John – played by Brooks like an Indiana Jones having a nervous breakdown – is plagued by visions of skull-headed demons leering over his nearest and dearest. “I think I’m losing it,” he complains to his wife, Susan (Jeri Ryan). “It’s probably just the meds,” she says. Viewers will need prescription-grade stuff themselves to stomach the stiff creature designs and lame CGI, with the revenants hanging around hospitals and high-school corridors like Skeletor cosplay casualties. The script, by Maurice Hurley (who is taking part, with Shatner and Ryan, in something of a Star Trek alumni reunion), also fails to convince. No opportunity for crass emotional manipulation, deadweight exposition or cornball reversals is left undisturbed.There’s the nugget of a good idea in having the whole family, who tag along for the return to the cave, save the hero-archaeologist. But it is soon discarded in favour of baseline macho bluster. “That’s a sound telling you to man the fuck up,” Hayes tells John, hearing distant carnage. Lines like that from Shatner, with a face tinted Trump orange, might play as some sort of American satire were the rest of the film’s construction not so shoddy. There’s not much veteran B-movie director Jared Cohn can do to save this pudding – though he can take the rap for bizarre pacing that even throws off the possibility of any basic post-pub pleasures.The Tomb: Devil’s Revenge is on digital platforms from 14 September."
Coastal Elites review – is this the worst film of the year?,"A range of stars, including Bette Midler and Issa Rae, act out clunky monologues in a tone-deaf attempt to speak to a divided America",1,"The questions of who a work of art is for and what it’s meant to accomplish usually prove germane in the process of criticism, and particularly so in the case of HBO’s new small-screen movie Coastal Elites. At least director Jay Roach and writer Paul Rudnick make that first part answered easily enough; this collection of monologues filmed in quarantine was originally supposed to go up as a play at New York’s Public Theater, and from the winking eponymous epithet on down, the writing plays to the sort of person one thinks of when picturing the typical patron of Broadway’s latest sensation du jour.With one significant exception, the five characters delivering these soliloquies of privilege are well-off and left-leaning. They live in the big, important cities, the ones with booming industries and beach access. They’re mostly involved in entertainment, whether as a diehard theatre-lover, an actor or a YouTube self-help guru. They listen to NPR and read the New York Times and own multiple tote bags acquired as donation incentives. Their problems, such as the awkwardness of being so rich you can’t avoid running in Republican circles or the frustration of auditioning for a blockbuster, look less than pressing from a middle-class point of view. They mean well, up to a point.But the second question, not of who but of why, clarifies the first one and damns the entire project along the way. There’s an ostensible argument to be mounted that Rudnick considers this an edifying satire pitched to the unconvinced. He makes hollow gestures of aisle-crossing conciliation, as if to show the opposition that their favored political straw people contain multitudes by giving insight into the intimately personal circumstances of their behavior. Rising thespian Mark (Dan Levy) can be whining about the big break he wants, and navigating his queer identity in a business intent on exploiting it. Middle-aged Upper West Sider Miriam (Bette Midler) rips a Maga hat off a stranger in a Starbucks, triggered by memories of her deceased husband. If they – the Republicans, the undecided, whoever – only knew these rich inner stories, perhaps they’d all be able to find a little sympathy and the world would be a less Trumpy place.And yet to believe in that mission, either in the earnestness of its rationales or the likelihood of its success, requires a staggering measure of naivety. Not since Kate McKinnon dressed up as Hillary Clinton to deliver a doleful rendition of Hallelujah on Saturday Night Live has tone-deaf liberal pandering been so blatant or difficult to stomach. Rudnick shamelessly flatters the sensibilities of his true presumed audience of sycophants, ruling them in the unquestionable right despite their painfully blinkered thinking. The film sometimes teases the faults of its subjects, with the occasional concession of mild snobbiness or light self-absorption. But it would never dare to lodge any actual critiques. We cannot afford to realize that the New York Times that Miriam worships has effectively abdicated their journalistic responsibilities for much of the past four years, or that meaningful progress can’t come from the big-budget studio film in which Mark hopes to portray a gay superhero. The state-of-the-nation ambitions clash harshly with a staunch refusal to consider the big picture.Issa Rae’s appearance punctuates the parade of whiteness, though her character does little more than provide lip service to diversity of perspective. She plays billionaire’s daughter Callie, put in an undesirable position as Ivanka Trump’s main prospect for an image-improving Black friend. Her anecdote makes a passing observation about complicity (she invokes the name of Kanye) without addressing the present upheavals beyond a mention that she’s just come from a protest. Her predicament is out of touch with the moment, falling prey to a disconnect that unites all the segments.The fourth scene goes to Sarah Paulson as a YouTuber whose guided meditation spins out into a recounting of a visit to her Trump-loving family. Or so she thought – her howl of despair ends with the discovery that her father numbers among the never-Trump Republicans, offended at the sitting president’s insults to John McCain. He embodies the Democrats’ wildest fantasy of the GOP as an enemy too principled to cast their lot with the clearly morally abhorrent, a hope in willful denial of what the party has repeatedly announced itself to be. Kaitlyn Dever’s conclusion, as a Wyoming nurse come to New York to volunteer at the center of the Covid-19 pandemic, may be the most calculated of all. She’s a transparent ploy to show that the noble commoners of the heartland have struggles dwarfing the miniature dramas of the others by comparison. Even so, amid the ravages of a pandemic, she’s so moved by a Biden-voting patient that she’s inspired to change her vote from Independent. This is a writer announcing how important and impactful his own work can be, a naked display of mutual self-congratulation between artist and audience the likes of which aren’t usually seen on the screen.Which brings us back to Broadway. Miriam turns up her nose at The Lion King and Phantom of the Opera as tourist attractions, though she belongs to the firmly middlebrow set that made the upbeat Hamilton a gargantuan hit and closed the edgy, challenging Slave Play after four months. Rudnick’s writing encapsulates and celebrates the worst instincts in this class of viewer, affirming where it should be confronting. The Danish film-maker Lars Von Trier says that a good film should be “like a rock in your shoe”, and the poet Cesar A Cruz declared the purpose of art “to disturb the comfortable and comfort the disturbed”. In this capacity, by the basic functioning of art, Rudnick and Roach have failed. As activists, doubly so.Coastal Elites premieres on HBO on 12 September with a UK date later this year"
Sun Children review – Iranian street kids strike gold,Majid Majidi’s cast of young toughs digging for treasure under a school deliver a heart-rending story with unexpected depth of emotion,4,"Sun Children, by the Iranian director Majid Majidi, gives us a prison-break drama that is escaping to nowhere, and a knockabout school comedy gone horribly wrong. The acting is broad, the plot gears often creak, but it has guts and heart and a grubby, street-smart charisma. It’s one of the finest films playing in this year’s Venice competition.Dedicated to “the 152m children forced into child labour”, this casts 12-year-old Roohollah Zamani as Ali, the pint-sized boss of a gang of thieves, a miniature wheel inside a much bigger machine, working for an unnamed local crime boss who skulks on the rooftop amid his pigeon coops. The boss wants Ali to retrieve a hoard of unspecified treasure, which is either buried in the local graveyard or in the drainage pipe that runs beside it. And the only way he can do it is to go back to school.The School of the Sun is a crowded, cacophonous hall of learning and hard knocks, propped up by donations and run by a pair of exhausted officials. Ali and his co-workers – Reza, Mamad and the tragic Abolfazl – line up outside the principal’s office, furiously repelling all attempts to eject them. They look like Just William and his outlaws pleading for a detention.Largely recruited from the streets of Tehran, Majidi’s non-professional players make for a sympathetic, heart-piercing crew, with Ali’s clenched features perfectly conveying the emotions of a child who is permanently on the brink of either fight or flight. The quartet, at least at first, are only posing as students. Their real aim is to dig a hole in the basement and get their mitts on the treasure. Ali’s mother is tethered to her bed inside a psychiatric institution. He plans to use his share of the gold to provide them with a home.Life, though, is complicated. There are wheels within wheels. Eventually we learn that the boys’ race-against-time mission is not the only high-stakes game in town. The School of the Sun is behind on its rent and faces imminent closure. Kindly Mr Rafie (Javad Ezati) shoots a fundraising video but accepts the prognosis is bleak. Midway through Sun Children, I felt I had a pretty good idea of its direction of travel, but that wasn’t quite it; Majidi tunnels deeper. In so doing, he exposes a subterranean world where there are no easy answers and few happy endings. Energetic and heartfelt, tipping towards tragedy, Sun Children crawls through the mud and emerges all the stronger. The quest is a red herring; the real treasure is the film."
"Hopper/Welles review – fascinating, exasperating home movie of a drunken evening","Intriguing but long-winded, this restored relic from 1970 reveals the two directors holding forth on everything from sex to Elvis",2,"In November 1970, Dennis Hopper flew from Taos in New Mexico to dine with Orson Welles in LA. Hopper was in the midst of producing The Last Movie; Welles was busily prepping The Other Side of the Wind. Both these productions would later famously combust, but on that evening in late fall, their creators were feeling optimistic, all-powerful. Welles flattered Hopper and said that he should one day play Jesus. They broke bread together in what now looks very much like a film-makers’ last supper.Hopper/Welles is the periodically fascinating, generally exasperating record of that meeting, an unearthed black-and-white home movie in which the two men get drunk and speak their minds on everything from Buñuel to Visconti, John Wayne to the Fondas. The order of the title’s star billing is intentional and unavoidable, since Welles keeps a hand-held camera trained on Hopper throughout and is content to play the role of off-screen interrogator. Flushed from the success of Easy Rider, Hopper had briefly found himself hailed as the saviour of American cinema. This film catches the one moment in his life, perhaps, where he could dare to regard Welles as the junior partner.Playing out of competition at this year’s Venice film festival, the restored footage is an intriguing relic – an offcut, raw copy. There’s something pleasingly voyeuristic about the experience of being allowed behind the velvet rope to watch these blusterers hold forth, although I expect their charms may be limited to die-hard devotees. Others will find it too much of a good thing. Give these two enough velvet rope and they’ll hang themselves with it.Eyes darting, giggling nervously, Hopper angles to turn the conversation to sex. He explains that he only became a director because he “wanted to get some more pretty ladies” but admits that basically all he’s ever wanted is to sleep with his mum. Forced off this topic, he tells a jaw-dropping story about Elvis Presley, making his first film at the age of 21 and believing that everything in the movies was true, that all the punches were real; that all the guns fired bullets. Elvis said that he could handle the fight scenes just fine, but he was concerned because the script also called for him to hit a woman and he’d never actually done that before in his life.As for Welles, he’s opaque. The great man dislikes Antonioni, scorns leftwing activists and claims to have never heard of Bob Dylan. But is this Welles’s own ignorance, or is it an affectation, a pose? Hopper would eventually take a cameo in The Other Side of the Wind and the dinner is at least in part a dress rehearsal, with Welles dipping in and out of character as the film’s main protagonist, a director named Jake Hannaford. “You’re a hard man to talk to, Jake,” Hopper giggles at one point.One gets the distinct sense that the feeling is mutual. This loquacious, long-winded affair works best as a snapshot of two men in time: the callow young gun who’s just struck gold and the legendary old campaigner who remembers all too well how that felt. Welles (or perhaps Hannaford) is interested in Hopper and suspicious of him, too. He grills the man for hours and appears to find him wanting. And the longer it lasts, the more Hopper starts to squirm. He’s unprepared, inconsistent. He’s like a smart-aleck student sitting a university exam.“I’d love the chance to change the world, any way that I could,” he splutters. “Whether it’s movies or whatever.”“How can you say that?” Welles snaps back. “Now that’s a nice smarmy statement meaning nothing. It’s charming and it’s lovable but it makes no sense at all.”And so on they go, as the clock ticks towards midnight. Welles frustrated by Hopper; Hopper tormented by Welles. Wherever these two men are today, one hopes for their sakes that they are not there together."
Truth Makes Free review – Poland's rebel priest meets his interrogator,A cat-and-mouse police grilling is blunted by explosive flashbacks in this real-life story of radical cleric Jan Zieja,3,"Robert Gliński’s foursquare historical drama extends the national self-examination through priests that Polish cinema initiated with Kler (2018) and last year’s Oscar-nominated Corpus Christi. Under surveillance here is real-life greybeard Father Jan Zieja (Andrzej Seweryn), who in the mid-70s found himself in the drab offices of security services major Adam Grosicki (Three Colours White’s Zbigniew Zamachowski), accused of preaching subversion while aiding anti-government factions. (The title derives from Zieja’s most quoted sermon, delivered to a colloquy of bishops amid rising Polish nationalism.) Reviewing the facts, Grosicki ventures: “It is enough for several biographies”, although Gliński and screenwriter Wojciech Lepianka shoehorn roughly two volumes’ worth into a 110-minute film.The strongest scenes follow from the duel of wits between the slobby, complacent functionary, ladling sugar into his tea, and the upright cleric, constitutionally unable to rise to his interrogator’s bait. For a long while, however, the leads are employed almost as clip-show hosts, their needling conversation cueing up flashbacks that find young Zieja (Mateusz Więcławek) negotiating the world wars and a divided postwar Poland. Narratively, these flashbacks intend to illustrate the ultimate test of faith, but they never quite attain a dramatic or spiritual weight: Gliński leans a little too enthusiastically into guns and explosions, knowing full well they’ll convert a small, intimate talkfest into a project ready for multiplex consumption.Circling one another and finding unexpected patches of common ground, Zamachowski and Seweryn are on such wily form that I wished Gliński had made that interrogation the whole picture, although the second half digs into Zieja’s theology in ways that may chime with Poland in 2020. As one sermon puts it: “The truth is being severely insulted today.” UK viewers will have the pleasure of discovering a story barely told on these shores – and in learning that the theme to The Archers played a part in Zieja becoming such a figure of liturgical liberalism.Handsomely austere, this is the kind of production national film institutes typically finance so as to enter awards races. It clings doggedly to its truths, where (the admittedly fictional) Kler and Corpus Christi took the odd risk. Truth Makes Free is on digital platforms from 5 September."
Final Account review – German war testimonies chill the blood,"Soldiers, accountants, children … Luke Holland persuaded elderly Germans to account for what they did under Nazi rule, and the air of shrugging unrepentance is damning",4,"Heinrich Schulze is a kindly-looking old man who lived as a child near the concentration camp at Bergen-Belsen in Lower Saxony, Germany. In the course of Luke Holland’s quietly searing Final Account, Schulze returns to the old family farm to point out the hayloft where a group of escaped prisoners had once taken shelter. The escapees were starving and had begged him for some food. But then the guards came and retrieved them, which was of course very sad. Under further questioning, with a sheepish shrug, Schulze admits that yes, the prisoners were recaptured because he himself called the guards. As to what became of them after that? “Oh,” Herr Schulze scoffs. “Nobody knows that!”Round them up and bring them out: the bystanders and functionaries, the children who pitched in and the adults who turned a blind eye. Holland, a British documentary-maker, spent the last decade of his life with these straggling survivors of history, those with first-hand experience of the Nazi regime, and the results are damning; the testimonies chill the blood. Monsters, Primo Levi once wrote, are always aberrations. But the small men who watch from the sidelines and occasionally lean in to lend a hand: these are the real danger. They’re even worse than the monsters.Holland names these functionaries – and therefore it’s important that we do the same. Margarette Schwarz recalls having her teeth filled and straightened by the inmates of Dachau. (“They were nice prisoners,” she says.) Herman Knoth explains that the Waffen-SS were seen as the peak of the nation (“Not just physically. Spiritually, too”). Even today, half-deaf and doddery, Karl Hollander admits that he still honours Hitler and can’t bring himself to blame him. He feels that on balance the Jews should not have been killed. They should have been driven out of the homeland instead.While few of Holland’s other subjects are as unrepentant as Hollander, their airy defences sound depressingly similar, to the point where one half-suspects witness tampering on an industrial scale. Either they knew nothing about what was really going on or – if they did – they bear no responsibility whatsoever, given the fact that they were frontline soldiers, or humble accountants, or excitable members of the Hitler Youth. A precious few (Hans Wierk, Kurt Sametreiter) call out these lies for what they are, insisting that, yes, everybody knew what the camps were for; you could smell the bodies burning from 2km away. The others, meantime, are keen to explain the ways in which their very presence boosted the local economy. The camps, it was said, helped the butchers, the bakers and the grocers as well. Everyone benefited, except for the people inside.Holland was diagnosed with cancer while working on this project and he died in June, shortly after its completion. He leaves behind a simple, unadorned study of everyday evil, one which balances eye-witness accounts with archive footage and wintry location shots of mountains, forests and leaf-blown railway tracks. Explicitly, his film shows how a hundred shades of grey combine to make a darkness. Implicitly, it warns that it could well happen again.Kurt Hollander, it turns out, is not the most purely worrying inhabitant of Final Account. That dubious honour falls to the unnamed, pixelated young student who berates elderly Hans Wierk for being ashamed of his history and says that the old man should be more worried about an Albanian immigrant mugging him than anything his country may or may not have done long ago. Sat at a table, listening to this diatribe, Wierk is distraught and close to tears. He shouts: “I ask only this of you. Do not let yourself be blinded”; the past speaking to the present in a hoarse, failing voice. Final Account screened at the Venice film festival and is released on 3 December in UK cinemas."
Lucid review – eerie drama tumbles into incoherence,A man’s inability to tell dreams from reality makes for a smart premise but alarms sound when the plot begins to unravel,2,"At one point in this British drama, Theo (Cristian Solimeno), the sharp-tongued bullying employer of protagonist Zel (Laurie Calvert), describes the latter as having all the charm of a “pubic hair in a cheese sandwich”. That’s maybe a bit harsh, but not entirely wrong. Introverted, shuffling young twentysomething Zel is far less engaging than practically every other character in the film, from his nagging mum (Sadie Frost) who swings by briefly to complain about his flat’s hygiene and is barely seen again, to the more compelling figure of Elliot (Billy Zane), Zel’s enigmatic, only-a-bit-creepy neighbour who gets him into lucid dreaming as way to deal with his social anxiety.Writing down his dreams in a journal every morning seems to help Zel become more assertive, capable of asking out his beautiful neighbour (Felicity Gilbert), who may or may not be a dancer at the private members’ club where Zel works as a car park attendant.Slowly the boundary between dreams and waking reality becomes blurry and porous, and by the end who knows what the hell is going on. Another pretty girl, Kat (Sophie Kennedy Clark), distinguishable from the other one thanks to her blue hair, wafts through and seems to both work at the club and live in the same block of flats as everyone else. Writer-director Adam Morse, making his feature debut after several shorts, seems to be turning the limited location budget into a plot device in itself.Although the cinematography by Michel Dierickx, with its jewel-bright hues and hazy backgrounds, is properly oneiric and eerie, Morse isn’t quite resourceful enough to devise a satisfying final act. The film ends with an inert thud.Lucid is on digital platforms from 7 September."
Bulletproof review – violent cops flout the rules. Is this meant to be fun?,This witlessly macho crime drama is tedious enough but asking us to sympathise with trigger-happy lawmen is beyond the pale,1,"This crass, macho movie is an LA police drama with an unreconstructed 1970s mentality. Its heroes are tough-guy white cops with chevron moustaches who’ll smoke on duty if they damn well please, and to hell with the regulations. The only significant female character is a drug addict who allows a pimp to sell her daughter to a drug gang. African American men mostly appear cuffed and face down on the bonnet of a patrol car. And its sympathy for white lawmen who play fast and loose with the rules – especially at a time when so many unarmed black men are dying at the hands of white officers – feels shamefully irresponsible.The drama takes place over one night in the squad car of fresh-faced beat cop Nick Holland (Luke Kleintank) and his grizzled partner Ray (Thomas Jane). Ray’s primary lesson to the rookie appears to be versing him in cliched cop talk (“There’s the world inside your cop car, and everything else”). The pair make a handful of run-of-the-mill arrests while Ray attends to a personal matter: investigating the disappearance of his dead partner’s eight-year-old daughter. Inevitably, justice and the protection of women and children will require him to skirt the rules.To hammer home the point that Ray is a good guy, writer-director Joel Souza gives us a dirty cop, Jack VanZandt (Josh Hopkins), a speed-freak knucklehead who rampages around the city beating the living hell out of anyone who looks at him funny. This is mediocre, mostly forgettable drama, but it leaves a nasty taste. You can imagine it screened at the Republican party convention as the warm-up to a law and order debate. Bulletproof is on digital platforms from 7 September."
I'm Thinking of Ending Things review – another superb nightmare courtesy of Charlie Kaufman,"Jessie Buckley is a troubled young woman on the brink of breaking up with her boyfriend in this surreal, disquieting and sometimes extraordinary drama",4,"With his new film, Charlie Kaufman again proves that if you want something to make you feel trapped in a terrifying claustrophobic nightmare for ever and ever ... well, he’s your guy. His latest movie is about a student, played by Jessie Buckley, who for six weeks has been dating a dullish man called Jake (Jesse Plemons) for reasons that that she can’t put her finger on. She is now going to meet his parents, an important next step that she has sleepwalked into, like everything else in their relationship.It means a long, uncomfortable, cold drive out to these old folks’ creepy farm in the countryside – just at the moment when she realises that she maybe wants to end things with Jake, which gives her an anti-epiphany about her life and his. (“I’ve never mentioned Jake to my parents and I guess I never will,” she murmurs silently.)She has a clear, dispassionate glimpse of someone whose existence she really isn’t committed to and also of their supposed future lives together: a pointless, arbitrary entanglement, like all coupledom. A warning and despairing voice whispers in her head that all this is pointless but also breaking up could be pointless, too. Should she be ending things in a more radical way? Soon she is to be vouchsafed a haunting vision of the things that are important to poor, boring Jake – his mum and dad (wonderfully played by Toni Collette and David Thewlis), a local ice-cream store and his high school, whose sad old janitor (Guy Boyd) haunts this movie’s dreams.I’m Thinking of Ending Things is adapted by Kaufman from the novel by Canadian author Iain Reid and it’s really scary in a way that conventional scary movies really aren’t scary: insidiously disquieting and yet also somehow poignant and sad, a secondary mood that finally, inexplicably emerges from an unending rhapsody of directionless weirdness. Who is this woman? Who is Jake? Who is the janitor? It’s an arresting drama, although I was sorry that straight-up comedy (which Kaufman can really do) played little part.This film happens to be coming out right on top of Kaufman’s other new work – an epically bizarre autofictional novel called Antkind – and there are points in common, namely, Kaufman’s extraordinary, compulsive way of creating an alternative world of loneliness and sadness, accumulating tension and anxiety and suppressed panic minute by minute. You can spend up to an hour wondering uneasily when this film is going to start, while also realising that you have been on the edge of your seat.As ever, Kaufman shores up his world with pop-culture fragments. Real people get roped in. He has a digression-daydream featuring a made-up romcom directed by Robert Zemeckis. Are we supposed to look down on Zemeckis, therefore? Not necessarily. The couple’s road trip also features a long and rather bad-tempered discussion of the film A Woman Under the Influence by John Cassavetes, although the directors that have surely influenced I’m Thinking of Ending Things, such as Buñuel and Lynch, go unmentioned.The centre of the horror is that farm, stark and cold, where Colette and Thewlis’s strange pair host a decidedly unrelaxed supper party for the unhappy couple. As their appearance starts changing, with the furnishings and photos changing, too, Buckley starts politely asking Jake if they can go home now, and Kaufman demonstrates his unearthly skill in creating scenarios like lucid dreams. Molly Hughes’s production design and Łukasz Żal’s cinematography are also vital in fabricating this world.And what does it all mean? Kaufman is content to swirl away from actual revelations, but his evocation of high-school life occupies the position where in any other kind of fiction an explanation might go. It is a place where Jake seems to have picked up an uncool fondness for musicals and Broadway show tunes, and Kaufman imagines a kind of fantasy dance sequence for Jake and his new girlfriend in the corridors of the school. But perhaps it is more that for many (or maybe even everyone) high school felt shatteringly real in a way that nothing else would, and success there really does feel as good as winning the Nobel prize. Not that Jake has ever achieved anything of the sort, then or now.Plemons stolidly occupies the role of Jake – it is the kind of role that the late Philip Seymour Hoffman (star of Kaufman’s masterpiece, Synecdoche, New York) might also have played. And Buckley is impeccably cast as the young woman adrift in a bad dream someone else is having. I’m Thinking of Ending Things is on Netflix from 4 September"
"Away review – silent, surreal and entrancing animation",This silent adventure film about a man who parachutes out of a plane and lands on an island is both wondrous and weird – see it before Tenet,4,"If you have ever sat through the end credits of a mainstream cartoon feature, whether it’s because your kid kicked their shoes under the row in front or because you’re a trade-magazine critic measuring the running time to the minute, you’ll know that there are normally hundreds of people who work on these productions. Animating lends itself to finely divisible units of labour, even as it becomes ever more reliant on computers. But technology now also makes it possible for one extremely determined Latvian film-maker to make something wondrous and original in a home studio. It took Gints Zilbalodis some three-and-a-half years to make this crisp, entrancing 75-minute animated feature about a young man who falls out of a plane with a parachute and lands on an island inhabited by friendly birds, turtles and cats – but also a giant shadow monster whose touch instantly kills all life. Luckily, the nameless hero finds a motorcycle and takes off on a journey across the oddly volcanic landscape, (Lanzarote was one visual touchstone), managing to always stay mere metres ahead of the monster.Not a word is spoken throughout, which harkens back to an older era of cinematic storytelling. At the same time, the extreme frame-to-frame fluidity of the computer-assisted animation style, composed entirely of fields of subtly modulated colour, no outlines and minimal modelling, looks completely 21st century. The story is fairytale simple and quite strange, and it’s no surprise to hear that Zilbalodis made it up as he went along. Only towards the end did he realise he was making an allegory about his struggle to complete the film itself. He even wrote the synth-generated music heard here, nothing fancy or complicated with its repetitious chords and phrases, but still oddly potent, recalling the work of the modern minimalists (Philip Glass, Max Richter, Jóhann Jóhannsson and so on) that were his inspirations. If you’re going to take a risk at going out to a cinema to see one movie, don’t bother with Christopher Nolan’s Tenet; see this instead in a darkened theatre on a big screen."
Hope Gap review – marriage hits the rocks at the seaside,Annette Bening and Bill Nighy are terrific as a middle-aged couple who have everything – except a happy relationship,3,"The last film playwright-screenwriter William Nicholson wrote was Breathe, a based-on-a-true-story drama about a deeply happy marriage challenged by the inability of the husband – a polio survivor – to breathe without a respirator. With Hope Gap, Nicholson’s adaptation of his own late-80s stage play The Retreat from Moscow, the dynamics are flipped, presenting the story of a couple who have just about everything a middle-class retired couple could want – security, a lovely house on the English south coast, their health – apart from a happy marriage.Light-stepping, terminally recessive schoolteacher Edward (Bill Nighy, dialling it down to give one of best performances in years) has fallen out of love with his perpetually critical, intellectually rigorous wife Grace (Annette Bening), who has been compiling an anthology of poetry for years. When their adult son Jamie (Josh O’Connor, exceedingly good at projecting shy vulnerability beneath a superficial cheeriness) comes for a visit, Edward reveals his plans to end the marriage and move out, forcing Jamie to act as a mediator between his muddled father and raging, wounded mother.At one point, Jamie talks about how happy he had been years ago, walking to Hope Gap on the coast as he swung between each parent. That symbolism, echoing how he’s trying to manage his parents now, is painfully on the nose. In fact, there are a few too many whopping bits of literary clever-clogging in the dialogue, such as a reference to how the revert function on Wikipedia entries operates as a metaphor for soured relationships.Nevertheless, the performances are terrific, especially from Bening who adds yet another deeply nuanced study to her gallery of complicated, smart women of a certain age. It’s up there with her turns in The Kids Are All Right and 20th Century Women. Anna Valdez-Hanks’ limpid cinematography, capturing the cool, flat light of the British seaside, is also a plus.Hope Gap is in cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema from 28 August"
Anbessa review – heart-rending tale of a boy living on the edge,"An irresistibly charismatic farm boy, displaced by a housing development on the outskirts of Ethiopia’s capital, is the star of this affecting documentary",3,"The American director Mo Scarpelli makes a miraculous discovery in her new documentary – a 10-year-old Ethiopian farm boy who has been displaced from his home by urbanisation. Scarpelli has said that when she spotted Asalif Tewold on the street in Addis Ababa, she knew instantly that she wanted to make a film about him. You can see why. A charismatic kid with energy and imagination, he’s at that perfect stage of boyhood with an appetite for adventure and make-believe. That said, Scarpelli’s observational film-making style, slow and lingering, is a challenge and likely to be off-putting to all but hardcore lovers of arthouse.Asalif and his mum live in a toolshed on the edge of a sprawling new apartment complex in the Ethiopian capital – squatting with other members of their traditional farming community, who have been kicked off their land to make way for the development. A resourceful, inventive boy, Asalif scavenges rubbish piles for wire and electronic parts, which he uses to construct DIY torches and mechanical toys. His partner in crime is Kuba, another country boy. When they quarrel, Asalif befriends Fikadu, a kid from one of the apartment blocks.In a heart-rending scene, Asalif presents Fikadu with a homemade toy helicopter, a strip of metal whirring around as a propeller. His new friend is unimpressed. “My parents will buy me a better one,” he says, looking at it as if it’s a piece of junk. The scene says everything about how Asalif doesn’t belong in Fikadu’s world.In front of the camera Asalif is a natural; it’s as if he is unaware that he’s being filmed at all. Of course, that can’t be true. Scarpelli followed him for two years, and, watching her film, I wondered how much she contrived scenes such as the one with the helicopter to illustrate her concerns about gentrification and those left behind like Asalif."
Random Acts of Violence review – exasperating serial killer-slasher,Jay Baruchel writes and stars in a finger-waggingly pious and pointless story about violence in entertainment,2,"The Canadian actor Jay Baruchel – a Judd Apatow regular and the voice of Hiccup in the family animation How to Train Your Dragon – has directed an exasperating serial killer-slasher. He brings to the genre a script with brain cells spilling out of its victims’ smashed skulls and the acting is a cut above – performed in an easy improvy naturalistic style that feels very Apatow. But inexplicably Baruchel and his co-writer Jesse Chabot staple on a finger-waggingly pious and pointless message about violence in entertainment.Jesse Williams stars as Toronto comic book artist Todd, who’s struggling with the final issue of his mega successful R-rated franchise Slasherman. The series is based on actual events, half a dozen grisly unsolved murders that took place along a stretch of Interstate 90 in the late 80s. To get his creative juices flowing, Todd takes a road trip along the highway, slumming it in scummy motels with his girlfriend, personal assistant and goofy business partner (nicely played by Baruchel). Todd, a left-leaning liberal who would no doubt describe himself as a feminist, is unnerved by fanboys at a comic bookstore signing. While he has intellectualised the gut-wrenchingly horrible images of tortured and disembowelled women in his comics, to the creepy guys dressed up like his protagonist in welders masks, Slasherman is a hero.Worse, the real-life serial killer (Simon Northwood) is at it again, and clearly he’s been reading Todd’s comic books – giving the film a couple of genuinely scary early kills. The local cops think Todd is to blame for the new spate of murders: “Even if you didn’t kill this girl you may as well have. Your mind is all over this mess.” And with this, the movie falls apart with some moral handwringing that will likely infuriate genre fans, and for everyone else, feel like a tired airing of the debate around violence in movies – all the more objectionable in a film with its fair share of mutilated female victims."
Ava review – smart teenage thriller amps up the micro-tyrannies,Sadaf Foroughi turns the family drama trope on its head in this superb story of a girl in Iran at war with her mother,4,"There is a moment in this almost forensically severe film when a furious mother jams her fingernails into her rebellious daughter’s cheek. Her hand is transformed for a second into a claw, and the girl’s face clenches into a grimace, not resisting the imminent assault. But after a moment, her mum thinks better of it, removes her hand and storms away, perhaps humiliated by having descended to her daughter’s level of childish spite without even being able to go through with the threat. Not a drop of blood has been spilled, yet it is the most authentic moment of violence imaginable.This debut feature by the Iranian-Canadian director Sadaf Foroughi takes what might otherwise be a banal family-drama trope – moody teenage girl with warring parents starts acting out – and turns it into something resembling a political thriller. In present-day Iran, and many other strict societies, a teenage girl who presumes to challenge her parents and teachers is made to feel like a dissident in a police state, forever nursing secrets, forever being questioned and harassed by the authorities, forever getting her friends into trouble as possible accomplices and losing those friends as they decide where their own loyalties lie. Foroughi’s camera sometimes seems like a surveillance device, recording the scenes from fixed positions which sometimes cut off heads and doesn’t show one of the characters in one dialogue scene. The result is not unlike a movie by Iranian film-maker Asghar Farhadi – who has himself imbibed the icier techniques of the European arthouse – and sometimes like a play by Terence Rattigan.Ava, played with pressure-cooker resentment by Mahour Jabbari, is a teenage girl in Iran who is beginning to lose her temper with her parents, with school and with life itself. Her mother, Bahar (Bahar Noohian), is a hospital doctor, stressed and overworked, with a need to control and discipline her increasingly intractable daughter. Her easygoing husband, Vahid (Vahid Aghapoor), is often away on business, so the heavy lifting of parenthood is up to Bahar. She is beginning to dislike Ava’s music lessons, which she now thinks are not just valueless academically but involve Ava mixing with unsuitable female friends and also possible secret boyfriends. Meanwhile, Ava has bet her obnoxious, sneery classmate Shirin (Sarah Alimardani) that she can’t go on a date – something heartbreakingly platonic and innocent – with a boy called Nima (Houman Hoursan) so she needs her friend Melody (Shayesteh Sajadi) to cover up for her.Bahar becomes so hysterically suspicious and angry that she makes a garden-variety teen escapade into something much worse and takes Ava to a gynaecologist to make sure that she is still a virgin, an act of cruelty that leads to a shocking incident. Ava is being similarly bullied and intimidated by a fastidious headteacher who wears a pair of white gloves with which she daintily picks sugar cubes out of a hygienically wrapped jar for her tea.This film immerses you into its world so pitilessly that it isn’t until it is over that you realise that its pettinesses, misogynies and micro-tyrannies are outrageously pointless. You are so swept up in Ava’s terrible situation that it almost doesn’t occur to you to note that every problem here is the creation of the heavy-handed political class of the parent/teacher world. Ava herself is used to moving around the family apartment as noiselessly as a cat, eavesdropping on her parents, who are astonished to learn that Ava knows something shaming about their early life together. How does she know? Probably through hearing them discuss it, because they are often so dysfunctionally indifferent to her existence as a young adult.What is even more disquieting is that music itself – that precious educational and cultural commodity – is ambiguous here. Is music an escape or just another refinement of torture? Ava has a sharp-tongued and rude music teacher, a classic proponent of “high standards” who makes music into an ordeal, and perhaps that is the point: Ava’s violin lessons were acceptable to her parents because they were a time-consuming ordeal of tension and subjection. Ava is made with superb technique and real style."
The One And Only Ivan review – Disney's painting gorilla movie lacks colour,The true story of a silverback gorilla who lived in a mall is brought to half-life in a rushed and magic-free late summer adventure,2,"There’s a late summer laze to Disney’s third-tier kids film The One and Only Ivan, one of their rare live-action offerings that isn’t yet another unnecessary remake of an animated hit. It’s a true story that inspired a much-loved novel which in turn became, briefly, a hot property in Hollywood with Mike Newell attached to direct a script from the excellent Mike White and Angelina Jolie signing on as producer and star. But a long road lay ahead and six years after the rights were swooped up, the end product now lumbers into view on Disney+, a theatrical release cancelled due to the ongoing pandemic.Although on reflection, it’s a merciful transition, a passable enough adventure on the small screen that would have felt stranded on anything bigger. It’s not that it looks cheap per se, far from it, there’s just something rushed and unremarkable about it, a secondhand quickie that has the ingredients to soar but can’t quite engineer them in a way that lifts it off the ground. The story focuses on a silverback gorilla named Ivan (voiced by Sam Rockwell) who is raised by Mack (Bryan Cranston) as if he were a son but as Ivan ages, he becomes too big to keep at home and so he’s moved to Mack’s mall circus as a main attraction. Years later, where we initially meet him, he’s content enough with his routine although the business is flailing. When a baby elephant is brought on board, Ivan is reminded of the wilderness he has quietly come to miss and so a plan is hatched.One of the biggest issues with many of Disney’s live-action, or at least part live-action, remakes of their animated features is that the studio has been taking slight stories and expanding them beyond what’s necessary. Take Cinderella (74 minutes to 106) or Dumbo (64 minutes to 112), both bloated misfires that struggled to pad their way to an adult length. Strangely, the opposite is true here as in a swift 94 minutes, White races through events at such speed that we scarcely have time to take a breath and rather than feeling as though we’re being whisked away with the magic of it all, we’re left wondering what was left on the cutting room floor. Because so many connecting scenes are missing and so many characters underdeveloped that one starts to wonder how torturous the post-production process might have been, a rather characterless film seeming more like it was assembled by committee rather than impassioned individuals. It’s disappointing given White’s great ability as a comic writer (from The Good Girl to Enlightened to School of Rock) and a strange choice for acclaimed theatre director Thea Sharrock, who never really finds a way to make the film look like anything more than production line Disney content.A reliable ace is Sharrock’s deftly picked cast, a reminder yet again of Disney’s ability to look beyond star power to find distinctive, well-matched voices. The lineup might be starrier than usual here but each actor brings character to their respective animal from Jolie’s elderly elephant to Danny DeVito’s stray dog to Helen Mirren’s pampered poodle and after big names being thrown voice work for their status rather than suitability (Warner’s Scoob being the most recently egregious example), it’s refreshing to see a finer balance. There’s also some solid effects work with the animals but the aforementioned rush means that emotional beats aren’t given the space to truly land and so while Ivan’s face might emote in a way that’s impactful, he’s not given enough of a character (his ability to paint, pushed to the forefront in ads, is a subplot at best) to ever successfully tug at our heartstrings. His murky, unsure father-son relationship with Cranston is also rather empty, the knotty morality of how the two really see each other never fleshed out enough.There are some interesting, briefly teased, ideas about captivity and the psychology of animals who have grown reliant on the humans they also silently resent but as with so much of the film, they fade fast, silenced with a dog fart. Rather than a heartwarming family favourite-in-the-making, The One and Only Ivan is just a vaguely watchable cookie-cutter caper thrown together by people who should know how to make something far sweeter and substantial, a fleeting attraction for undiscerning young kids and a whelming waste for anyone older.The One and Only Ivan is available on Disney+ from 21 August"
Lowdown Dirty Criminals review – endearingly scrappy Kiwi crime comedy,James Rolleston leads a hang-loose caper of a pizza deliveryman who finds himself embroiled in a crime gang full of cartoon menace ,3,"Director Paul Murphy’s Wellington-set crime comedy, Lowdown Dirty Criminals, seems to have fallen out of a time warp, feeling dated almost immediately. In the first scene the filmmaker deploys Guy Ritchie-esque freeze frames and kicks off a nonlinear Tarantino-like structure – which were particularly popular techniques for stories about gangsters and nogoodniks during the 90s and in the early years of the new century.It opens with a young pea-brained protagonist, Freddy (James Rolleston), interrupting a Reservoir Dogs style face-off between gun-wielding criminals to commence his voiceover: “Have you ever had one of those days where everything just turns to shit?” Although this is only the opening scene, by this point Murphy has already established a laidback and perhaps even quintessentially New Zealand vibe, speaking directly and personably to the audience.Before the film begins we see the words “for dad” and then “a film by Paul Murphy and heaps of others”, which doesn’t exactly suggest what follows will constitute gut-busting grit. The subsequent experience maintains a hang-loose and endearingly scrappy tone, with a cartoon menace befitting of a Cheech and Chong or Harold and Kumar movie.The core challenge for Murphy and screenwriter David Brechin-Smith is to give the film just enough sense of danger that we accept the stakes for the protagonist are high, while never seriously inferring that he is capable of wicked deeds – even when brandishing a gun and assigned a mission to whack someone.The experience hangs on the likability of Freddy, a pizza delivery man thrust into an assortment of comical situations he is neither prepared nor suited for. First of the inconsequential variety – dealing with cheapskates trying to scam a free feed – then the kind with more serious repercussions, after Freddy and his pal Marvin (Samuel Austin) draw the ire of criminal kingpin Mr Spiggs (Scott Wills). The pair approach the smooth-scalped gangster in the hope of earning more money and elevating their social status. He gives them an errand to pick up his birthday cake – and they botch the job badly.To make it up to Spiggs, they are told they must kill a man who is sleeping with his wife – a borderline implausible assignment given these two likable chaps are obviously not cold-blooded killers, or even killers of any kind. The question becomes: what sort of hi-jinx will Freddy and Marvin get embroiled in and make a mess of? Their exploits, padded out with inane and humorous conversations, lead them to interactions with members of a rival criminal gang led by another kingpin: “The Upholsterer”.This cat-stroking villain is played with snarling, hammy chutzpah by Rebecca Gibney, ramping up her badassery to cartoon levels and suggesting once again that, in a fight to the death with the likes of Liam Neeson, the Australian would come out on top. A scene with Gibney’s character slicing open the guts of a dead man, fishing through his obese belly with yellow gloves and pulling out various, erm, entanglements, epitomises the film at its most grotesquely trivial. Brechin-Smith occasionally resorts to juvenile gross-out humour, as if in the belief that he has exhausted all other options.Rolleston, whose breakout performance was as the lead in Taika Waititi’s crowd-pleasing coming-of-age comedy Boy, is the film’s crucial performer and human highlight. Rolleston is not just a likeable presence; he seems to bend the tone of the entire film in his lowkey direction, giving it a hard-to-hate sincerity even when it is vulgar. Helped along by those well-worn Ritchie and Tarantino-isms, which allow a degree of playfulness, Lowdown Dirty Criminals has a synchronicity between the lead character and the very form and content of the film.There are moments, such as a sizeable chunk of running time with Freddy situated underneath a bed, when you don’t even realise the film is being audacious, due to its unprepossessing vibes. Lowdown Dirty Criminals is a slight and derivative “in over their heads” story with a goofy charm; the sort of film in which an unexpected death leads to lines of dialogue like “we’re in deep shit now!”Despite the inevitable return to that freeze frame moment at the beginning, which reiterates what we would have ascertained anyway (that the life of the protagonist is never seriously under threat), the film maintains an air of unpredictability gleamed from its scatty approach. And Freddy (thanks to Rolleston) is a solid lead: the kind of guy you want to sit on the couch and chew the fat with. Lowdown Dirty Criminals opens nationally in Australia (except Victoria) and New Zealand on 20 August"
Babyteeth review – teen illness drama earns its emotional impact,Eliza Scanlen and Ben Mendelsohn lead a terrific ensemble cast in Shannon Murphy’s classy debut about an unlikely high-school romance,3,"This debut feature by the Australian film-maker Shannon Murphy, adapted by Rita Kalnejais from her stage play, is well acted, heartfelt, beautifully filmed. It’s a coming-of-age story of first love and family dysfunction with something of abstinence-adjacent YA tragedies such as The Fault in Our Stars and Midnight Sun. And however unfashionable Sam Mendes’s ’burb-dramedy American Beauty has become, Babyteeth shows the influence of that movie, with all its alienation and sexual anxiety experienced within the fraught family unit by teens and boomers. Babyteeth is watchable and emotionally forthright, though it has a fairly picturesque idea of what dying from cancer in your teens looks like. You might call it Insta-oncology.Eliza Scanlen is excellent as Milla, a 16-year-old in remission from cancer, wearing a wig to school to conceal her baldness. She also has a problem with her baby teeth, which may connote an ironised infantilism, and she’s lonely and frustrated with her well-meaning but controlling parents: Henry (Ben Mendelsohn), a psychiatrist, and Anna (Essie Davis), a former musician who gave it up to be a stay-at-home, hands-on mom. They never open up to Milla about how they’re feeling but they clearly have their issues – having taken to despairing lunchtime sex in Henry’s treatment room, yearning (in vain) for the quasi-adulterous role-play effect to reignite their intimacy. Henry has his own problems with prescription medication. They are frantically overprotective of Milla and duly horrified when she falls for Moses (Toby Wallace), a low-grade drug dealer and user – who has a spark of passionate life. It could be that only Moses can give Milla what she needs in whatever time she has left, and only Milla can redeem Moses.I wasn’t sure about the quirky chapter headings in the deadpan sans-serif font, but the story has its own emotional force and this is down to the really high standard of ensemble performance – shaped by Murphy’s direction – and the light, crisp, attractive look of the film created by cinematographer Andrew Commis and production designer Sherree Phillips. Scanlen gives an intelligent reading of her character’s pressures and Mendelsohn delivers a lovely, warm portrayal of her father.Scanlen and Wallace have a great rapport, although I’m not sure they would avoid talking about sex in the way they do here. Inevitably the ending is the big test, and Babyteeth ducks the issue somewhat in an admittedly ingenious way.The best scene comes at Milla’s school, when she is in the girls’ toilets looking at herself in the mirror and one of the high-status girls, all friendliness and smiles, asks if she can try on Milla’s wig – just to see what she would look like. It is an edge-of-the-seat moment, coolly handled by Murphy. A film with real sensitivity.Babyteeth is released in UK cinemas on 14 August."
"The Host: Bong Joon-Ho's breakout monster movie is eerily prescient, not-quite-escapist fare",Parasite director focuses on humanising the dysfunctional family at the heart of a story that avoids obvious villains,0,"If you thought a black comedy about a toxic, mutated monster on the loose in Seoul would be a complete escape from your reality, think again.Before Parasite, Korean auteur and Oscar-winner Bong Joon-ho released his first crossover hit with 2006’s The Host. An uncommon genre in his home country, Bong has said people initially laughed when he first decided to make monster films. But in spite of the scepticism, The Host became the highest-grossing Korean film that year and a surprising American hit, garnering fans such as director Quentin Tarantino.Monsters have always been prevalent in Bong’s films – figuratively and literally. In his crime thriller Memories of Murder, police are on the hunt for a serial killer that can’t be found and in Okja, the monster is not the giant, pig-like creature at the centre of the narrative but a multi-national corporation headed by Tilda Swinton. In The Host we may have a typical monster but just like all of Bong’s films, the villain is never definitive. I knew when I pressed play on The Host it wasn’t going to be just a typical series of superficial CGI moments and one-liners. And thank god for that.Inspired by a real-life case in 2000 in which a US morgue official was convicted of dumping hazardous chemicals into the Han River in South Korea, the film’s opening scene is of an American scientist ordering his Korean subordinate to pour a large amount of formaldehyde down the lab drain.Fast forward a few years and we are introduced to our protagonists, the dysfunctional Park family, who own a little convenience stall alongside the river: patriarchal grandfather Hee-bong; his lazy, buffoon son Gang-du (played by Bong’s frequent collaborator Song Kang-ho); Gang-du’s charming daughter Hyun-seo; and her aunt and uncle, archery champion Nam-joo and failed activist turned unemployed alcoholic, Nam-il. Within minutes, the chemically mutated creature enters the screen, wreaking havoc on the river’s busy thoroughfare. The beloved Hyun-seo is swallowed by the monster and taken down into the depths of the sewerage system.The US military immediately overtakes the city – a critique on the lingering American presence in Korea – forcing a lockdown and everyone into quarantine (sound familiar?) due to the suspicion that the monster has unleashed a deadly virus. In quarantine, Gang-du receives a muffled call from Hyun-seo’s phone and the family becomes convinced she’s still alive. The authorities won’t listen, so the family breaks out, becoming fugitives as they attempt to rescue her, and that’s where the story really kicks off.Taking inspiration from Spielberg’s Jaws and M. Night Shyamalan’s Signs, Bong focuses on humanising the “loser” family rather than the otherworldly monster to elicit powerful drama and to create unlikely heroes of the flawed, complex and ultimately relatable Parks who hold the moral compass.The family is also the through line that allows Bong to tie in his not-so-subtle political views around issues such as the convenient “weapons of mass destruction” claims justifying the war in Iraq to the use of Agent Orange by US forces in the Vietnam War.Perhaps the most startling social commentary in the film is the eerily prophetic event of quarantine. From a city in lockdown being advised of flu-like symptoms, to the government grappling with an unknown “monster”, the film directly taps into our current strange existence in Covid-19 times. For me, it all culminates in one comedic scene of masked citizens waiting for a green light and an unmasked man coughing and spitting loudly, causing everyone to tense up and edge away.An ambitious film that covers a lot of ground, The Host is funny, entertaining and poignant, and the CGI holds up pretty well for a mid-2000s film. Bong may have left a few questions unanswered, but it was definitely his plan to make us reflect on our present situation through the film’s messages long after the credits roll. The Host is available to stream on SBS On Demand"
Perfect 10 review – teenage backflips,"There are shades of Lynne Ramsay in writer-director Eva Riley’s lyrical feature debut, about a teenage gymnast’s battle with grief",4,"Fifteen-year-old Leigh (Frankie Box) has channelled her grief over her mother’s death into long, hard hours of gymnastics training. But her honed skills are undermined by a collapse in confidence, punctured by the mean girls on the squad who mock her as a “charity project”.The unexpected arrival of Joe, her tearaway half-brother, stirs in Leigh a reckless need for closeness, for approval. A terrific scene hugs Lycra-tight to Leigh as she backflips and spins for Joe’s cheering gang of friends in a parking lot. Writer/director Eva Riley’s debut feature has something of the jagged lyricism of early Lynne Ramsay – Riley floods with a magic-hour, honeyed glow a scene that takes place in what looks like the scrag end of an industrial estate. But the film’s main asset is impressive newcomer Box: veering between bratty backchat and bruised reticence, she’s tossed on unpredictable tides of teenage emotions.In selected cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema and BFI Player"
An American Pickle review – sweet generational comedy lacks a little bite,Seth Rogen stars as both a modern Jewish New Yorker and his miraculously revived great-grandfather in this affable fish-out-of-water tale ,3,"The British food writer and fermentation expert Thom Eagle writes that “crunch, heat – but not too much heat – sweetness and sharpness and salt” are what make a good pickle. This warm and whimsical caper about an immigrant worker who is brined for a century in a vat of pickles is sweet enough, but lacks an essential wince-inducing bite.Based on Simon Rich’s 2013 short story Sell Out, serialised in the New Yorker, it stars Seth Rogen as Herschel Greenbaum, a “ditch-digger” in rural Poland circa 1919 who emigrates to America with his wife and lands a job in pest control at a pickle factory in Brooklyn. A freak accident sees him falling into a vat of brine; a hundred years later the barrel and a perfectly preserved Herschel are discovered. He connects, then clashes with his great-grandson Ben (also played by Rogen), an app developer and all-round hipster cliche.Following the codes of the fish-out-of-water comedy subgenre, Herschel marvels at Ben’s SodaStream machine and the fact that he owns 25 pairs of socks (“You have two feet”). The orphaned Ben, on the other hand, is taken aback by his great-grandad’s fierce family loyalty and entrepreneurial streak. Discovering that his late wife’s grave sits beneath a giant billboard for vanilla vodka, a heavily accented Herschel proclaims he will “start pickle empire and make $200,000” to buy back the plot. Outraged that an organic grocery store is selling cucumbers for 90 cents a piece, he ends up foraging his ingredients from the supermarket’s bins and selling artisanal gherkins ($4 a reclaimed glass jar). His unruly beard only adds to the authenticity of his brand.The pickles are a hit until Herschel’s cart is shut down by the city’s health and safety department. His trajectory goes viral, along with some of his unsavoury tweets, and he experiences the whiplash of fickle public opinion. Jokes about gentrification work, but attempts to parody today’s social media outrage cycle feel laboured. Elsewhere, quips about non-dairy milk alternatives and unpaid internships are already dated.Boop Bop, the app Ben is developing, rates and ranks corporations based on how problematic they are, a kind of TripAdvisor for ethical businesses. So when Herschel’s shenanigans compromise a contract with a startup, Ben’s instinct is revenge, highlighting an apparent willingness to leave all ethics at the door. Millennial self-interest and performative liberal politics are contrasted with “authentic”, let-it-all-hang-out conservatism. It’s a simplistic critique. Still, the frequently charming Rogen brings enough of his affable, nice guy credibility to each character to ground both loose cannon Herschel and his straight man foil.While its gags about politics are slippery, the film is surprisingly adept at handling the more substantial theme of generational guilt. “You were raised Jew! Are you not still Jew?” Herschel asks the secular Ben, curious about how he views his heritage. Indeed, the film’s prologue is a 10-minute short film about the immigrant experience in and of itself. In the fictional town of Slupsk, Herschel narrates the story of his marriage to Sarah (Sarah Snook, Shiv from HBO’s Succession) and their journey to Ellis Island. Their romance blossoms at the side of a bog, where they bond over the fact that both lost their parents to the Cossacks, and their mutual favourite colour (black). At border control they are met with antisemitic remarks.Debut director Brandon Trost (previously a cinematographer and one of Rogen’s regular collaborators) shoots this sequence as a sepia-tinted fairytale, but struggle is baked into their American dream. Even the film’s title shrewdly suggests that America is built on the labour of immigrants."
Boys State review – amazing study of teenagers running for pretend office,"The gloves and training wheels come off as a group of smart, poignantly naive and utterly insufferable Texas boys get together to simulate government",5,"It’s not clear to me if this is a heartwarming study in young people’s idealism or a Lord of the Flies bloodbath with smug feral demons in white T-shirts. It’s not clear if it’s funny or tragic, if it’s reality TV or reality itself. But Boys State is as exciting and moving as Steve James’s high school basketball epic Hoop Dreams was a generation ago, with its emotional rawness, its guileless patriotism and capacity for hurt and wonder. We watch, in what feels like real time, as a group of ambitious teenage boys – smart, poignantly naive, utterly insufferable – get brutally acquainted with Kipling’s two “impostors”: triumph and disaster.It is the story of Boys State, a kind of annual debate club in the US for 16 and 17-year-olds organised by the American Legion, state by state, a project invented in 1937 – and there is, to put it delicately, a bit of a 1930s vibe about it. But it’s avowedly there to inculcate citizenship and leadership among America’s youth and reintroduce the values of reasoned argument to a generation addled by the social-media screaming match. Some of America’s biggest political legends took part in their youth, and the film shows the famous photo of a teenaged Bill Clinton shaking hands with JFK at his event. There are separate groups for girls and boys. Boys State is a little like the model UN, without the wussy liberal nonsense of pretending to be foreigners. The young people spend a week at the state capitol, run for pretend office, conduct boisterous debates and finally submit to a nerve-shredding election.In 2017, the Texas Boys State voted to secede from the union, causing national soul-searching, much like the Oxford Union’s King and Country debate in Britain in 1933. It was febrile and immature of the Texas boys, maybe, but then so is grownup American politics these days. The following year, documentary film-makers Amanda McBaine and Jesse Moss spent time with the Texan debaters, as they once again built America from the ground up in their own beardless image. Had the previous year’s mercurial, quasi-Trumpian mood receded into embarrassment or hardened further still? Is it more than a child’s educational game? By the end of this movie, with its shattering climax, it feels like the most important thing in the world.For Texas Boys State, the participants are asked to join and then decide on candidates and chairmen of the arbitrarily formed parties “Nationalists” and “Federalists”, followed by the overall vote – a convention that reinforces the sense among some of the teen cynics present that US politics is just a game. We see on someone’s phone the inevitable Matrix red pill meme about the corporations running things anyway. But it soon becomes horribly clear that the two parties are divided on left/right lines, and God help anyone who doesn’t love guns.For the Nationalists, the candidate is a Mexican American boy, Steven Garza, with a talent for sincere rhetoric, but whose gun-control views are held against him. His chair, René Otero, is an elegant African American boy originally from Chicago who says he has never seen so many white people before, and who wears half-moon glasses that make him look 40 years older than he is. For the Federalists, the chair, Ben Feinstein, is a gung-ho conservative who is a double amputee and wants to join the CIA; his candidate, Eddy Proietti Conti, is a young man who is described as a Ben Shapiro figure.Soon, the dirty tricks kick off. There is an attempt among some Nationalists to impeach their own chair (for conscious or unconscious reasons that we can only guess at) and the Federalists’ Instagram page mocks this internal row and fanatically attacks their opponent’s membership of the anti-school-shooting Never Again MSD movement. The Nationalists’ chair attempts to limit the Federalists’ debate time on technical grounds; the cry of “rigged” goes up and the acrimony boils over. The gloves and the training wheels come off.The tension is unbearable. And so is the great imponderable question: is the soul-crushing disappointment of defeat the rocket-fuel for future victory – like Nietzsche’s maxim about strength through not being destroyed, or One Direction conquering the world after coming third in The X Factor? Some of these boys are already as hard-faced and cynical as velociraptors. Some are gentle and sweet natured. Some are even shown changing their minds. It’s an amazing spectacle. Boys State is released in UK cinemas on 29 October, and is available on Apple TV+."
Antkind by Charlie Kaufman review – absurdism ad infinitum,The idiosyncratic screenwriter’s bloated debut novel – about an idiosyncratic screenwriter – is a slog,0,"Antkind is the debut novel of Charlie Kaufman, the Being John Malkovich and Synecdoche, New York film-maker, and its premise is incredibly, well, Kaufmanesque. A film critic named B Rosenberg discovers an unseen stop-motion movie – a three month-long work of astonishing brilliance – and is sure it will change his life, the art of cinema, possibly the entire world. But it burns in a truck fire before he can save it. After waking from three months in a medically induced coma, B turns to hypnotism to reconstruct the film from memory.From the start, the storytelling is unstable: details change, B’s exhaustive film nerdery is riddled with malapropian errors, fiction and reality blur. Antkind eventually embraces all-out chaos: by the end, the world is on fire, flying Trump robots are at war with a fast-food corporation, hospitals are staffed by clowns, ants time travel…I could go on. On and on and on. Kaufman certainly does: Antkind is 706 pages long. It offers a maximalist satire of a contemporary America defined by fake news, corporate bullshit, vacuous pop culture and performative wokeness, but one so excessive, surreal and repetitive that it is itself tiresomely bloated and absolutely exhausting. If anything can happen without consequence, stakes are lowered. It’s absurdism ad infinitum.Where Kaufman’s films are playfully mind-bending, they usually have real heart. But although Antkind is skippingly clever – saturated with comic allusions, puns, linguistic inventiveness and wildly unfettered imagination – it is sorely lacking characters you actually care about or any emotional narrative to cling to.B is a bitter, humourless, arrogant, middle-aged, white man, who believes himself to be extremely culturally sensitive; he makes a point of stating that his girlfriend is African American and using the gender-neutral pronoun “thon”. In fact, B is relentlessly revealed to be a self-pitying, sleazy racist. Of course, Kaufman invites us to see through B’s self-delusion and hypocrisy - he doesn’t defend B. But when you demand readers spend that much time with someone, you are still, to use a phrase Antkind would sneer at, privileging that white-male-cis-het perspective above all others. There is something deeply wearying about Kaufman mocking woke culture while delivering 700 pages of tedious, white-dude inner life.Besides, Kaufman’s own tone is one of tittering provocation: sending up tokenistic trans characters, queasily naming B’s daughter – a feminist who publicly renounces her father – Grace Farrow. These are Kaufman’s choices, not his character’s.He does use B’s insecure voice to snipe at real-life film-makers and critics, however, from Christopher Nolan to Mark Kermode, which lends Antkind a certain gossipy frisson (who is really doing the trash-talking: B or Kaufman?). Plus it allows him to get extra-meta: whenever B is rude about the films of Charlie Kaufman, the author enacts a slapstick revenge on his own creation, sending B tumbling down manholes.Antkind feels like a book that’s been indulged rather than edited; there’s a smaller, smarter novel somewhere in here, currently smothered in smug junk. One compelling section sees B meet his more successful doppelganger and tussle over their wildly different reconstructions of the film, throwing up enjoyably thorny questions about memory and interpretation, the purposes of comedy and what kind of talent and stories we value. But then Kaufman hurtles into the next surreal non sequitur, and the next, for another several hundred pages. You count them down, every one.

Make Up review – an eerie erotic awakening in a caravan park,A young woman suspects her boyfriend of infidelity in this striking drama set in off-season Cornwall,4,"British writer-director Claire Oakley’s striking feature debut transforms an off-season caravan park in Cornwall into a haunting hall of mirrors. Eighteen-year-old Ruth (Molly Windsor) is visiting her long-term boyfriend, Tom (Joseph Quinn), but upon discovering a fistful of copper hairs and a kiss smudge on their bedroom mirror, grows paranoid. Meanwhile, she befriends the glamorous Jade (Stefanie Martini), who gives her a manicure and ignites an erotic awakening.Some of the caravans are wrapped in plastic awaiting fumigation. Strange shapes lurk inside, behind what looks like stretched clingfilm, suggesting the suffocation of Ruth’s sexuality, itself a locked room that she has learned to seal off. Eerie images of a bloodied fingernail and long grass lit by amber floodlights signal Oakley’s sly sense of humour and eye for visual poetry. All the more frustrating, then, when the film’s third act lurches into coming-of-age cliches, including a fade-to-black snog at a beachside bonfire."
Summerland review – wartime wonderment with Gemma Arterton,The British actor excels as a crotchety loner who takes in a child evacuee in Jessica Swale’s uplifting debut feature,4,"What a lovely, hopeful and rather magical movie this is. The feature debut from writer/director Jessica Swale, whose impressive theatre CV includes the Olivier award-winner Nell Gwynn, Summerland provides just the tonic we need in times of turmoil. A tale of love lost and found, told with wit and charm, it maintains an impressive balance between the sly and the sentimental, gently subverting mainstream formulae as it slips back and forth in time, alternating between the realist and the romantic.We open in coastal Kent, 1975, with Penelope Wilton’s crotchety Alice rudely shooing children from the door of her cottage (“You know how you can help the aged? You can bugger off!”) so she can return to her typewriter. From here, we spiral back to the 40s, where the younger Alice (Gemma Arterton) taps away on the same keyboard. A recluse who investigates and debunks myths and folklore, searching for the facts behind the fiction, Alice is viewed with suspicion. The village children think she’s a witch or a spy; even the adults seem a bit scared of her.When young evacuee Frank (Lucas Bond) is dumped unexpectedly on Alice’s doorstep, she has no time for him, insisting that he be re-homed. But inevitably a bond grows between the pair, with Alice slowly warming to the new arrival who seems to rekindle long suppressed feelings of affection. Meanwhile, Swale’s story spirals back further still, to Alice’s meeting with Vera (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) in the 20s and the pang of first love that now sits like a chip of ice in her heart.“Would you think it was strange if a woman loved another woman?” Alice asks Frank, adding that “most people think it’s wicked”. But Frank is more interested in Alice’s belief that “stories have to come from somewhere” and together they start chasing castles in the sky, mirages that seem to provide a link between this world and the next.Beautifully shot by cinematographer Laurie Rose, who lends a magic-realist edge to down-to-earth details, Summerland conjures a honey-dappled world in which the possibility of redemptive miracles gradually illuminates the dark corners of loneliness. In the central role, Arterton (who also executive-produces) is terrific, relishing the opportunity to play a character who doesn’t care how others see her. An early scene, where Alice seems to offer chocolate to a child only to steal it away, is played with wicked gusto, daring the world to think the worst. Anyone who saw the acerbic comic short Leading Lady Parts will know that Swale has a killer eye for a sharply honed twist of the satirical knife. But it’s in its more melancholy moments that Summerland really makes its mark, with Mbatha-Raw perfectly cast as the face that haunts Alice’s dreams, reminding her how much she has lost.Smaller roles are equally well filled, with Tom Courtenay oozing avuncular charm as the schoolmaster who quips that “Shakespeare didn’t have to deal with Alice Lamb or he might have said, ‘Get thee under the table and hide!’” Top marks, too, to younger stars Bond and Dixie Egerickx, who plays Edie, “a maverick” who doesn’t “fulfil the feminine ideal” and looks set to inherit Alice’s independent mantle.“Planes crash,” Alice tells Frank as he wonders whether to launch a model aeroplane over a cliff. “What matters is how you deal with it.” Some will doubtless deal with Summerland by complaining about plot contrivance and schmaltz, a criticism amplified by the off-puttingly airbrushed poster. But like Arterton’s previous second world war picture Their Finest, this boasts real substance beneath the surface, keeping its feet on the ground and its head in the clouds."
Again Once Again review – elegant meditation on the pains of motherhood,This engaging film unpicks the challenges faced by a young mother trying to reconnect with the life she had before her son’s birth,3,"A woman leaves her boyfriend to visit her mum in Buenos Aires, taking their three-year-old son with her – not sure yet if it’s a holiday or a breakup. She hasn’t worked since her son was born and is having an emotional and intellectual crisis. She feels almost nonexistent. “I don’t see myself. Who am I?”This is an elegant, elusive debut from the Argentinian playwright Romina Paula, who picks away at the fantasy that motherhood leads to instant fulfilment. Her film is like an arthouse version of the sitcoms Motherland and Catastrophe, with fewer laughs and more philosophical introspection. It has the feel of a feminist essay that has been semi-dramatised for screen – with Paula starring as a fictional version of herself and her real-life mum and son Ramón playing themselves.On her first night back in Buenos Aires, Romina leaves a long message on her best friend’s phone. People warned her that the first months with a baby would be hard, she says, but it’s been three years. She loves her son but finds being a mother overwhelming and oppressive. Her conflict is cleverly dramatised in a scene where she is getting ready to go out with friends, her first night out in who knows how long.As she puts on her makeup, trying remember how to be this version of herself, her little boy bangs his toy drum incessantly in the room next door – it’s as if he’s telling her: “You can’t switch me off.” Newish mothers often talk to each other about these feelings, but it’s interesting how radical, almost unsayable, they still seem on screen.Nothing much happens. Romina’s mum looks after her son while she works as a private tutor giving German lessons. There are a couple of tentative romantic encounters that go nowhere. Romina doesn’t speak much, but Paula’s face is beautifully expressive; the camera is constantly nudging up closer, to see what it’s saying. She unpicks her feelings in the monologue that gives the movie that essay feel – wandering into subjects as varied as her family’s German ancestry and Argentina’s young feminists, known as the green movement. Some might find her style, leaving no thought unexamined, a bit rambling, but Paula is doing something interesting here. Again Once Again is available on Mubi from 29 July."
Alice review – sex work as quick-fix female empowerment,A middle-class Parisian woman becomes a high-end escort in a sanitised portrayal of prostitution,3,"Writer-director Josephine Mackerras’s bouncy but uneven feature debut follows a middle-class Parisian woman’s first foray into sex work. Learning that her husband, François (Martin Swabey), has frittered away their savings and her inheritance on boutique escorts, Alice (Emilie Piponnier) decides that she might give it a go herself. High-class sex work is presented as a financial quick fix and a route to female empowerment, but the film’s sex-positive politics gloss over any of the job’s potential pitfalls.The point is hammered home when Alice and fellow escort Lisa (Chloé Boreham) pop champagne on the Seine and scream “fuck ’em” (in English) at judgmental naysayers. Alice never experiences anything even mildly threatening, with Mackerras preferring to present the sex scenes as comedy set pieces. Piponnier is, however, a lanky joy to watch, all awkward, flailing limbs and expressive Bambi eyes."
How to Build a Girl review – enjoyably rough-and-ready,"Wobbly Wolverhampton accent and all, American actor Beanie Feldstein carries this hard-to-resist adaptation of Caitlin Moran’s bestselling roman-a-clef",4,"“What do you do when you build yourself, only to realise that you built yourself with the wrong things?” That’s the question at the heart of this entertainingly ramshackle coming-of-age story, adapted by screenwriter Caitlin Moran from her autobiographically inspired bestseller. The story of a working-class Wolverhampton teenager who lands a job writing for the London music press, it’s a cautionary yet empowering tale about following your dreams, even when they turn into nightmares. At its centre is an irrepressible soul who learns to her cost that spiteful criticism is easier to sell than honest enthusiasm. It’s a theme that will strike a chord with anyone who’s ever experienced the empty thrill of a vicious put-down, or been ridiculed for simply loving something without reservation.Beanie Feldstein, who did such sterling work in Lady Bird and Booksmart, is Johanna Morrigan, a studious mid-90s schoolgirl whose heroes (the Brontë sisters, Freud, Maria von Trapp, Sylvia Plath) speak to her from pictures on her bedroom wall. Bullied by book-throwing boys in the park, and ostracised by the “cool” crowd at school, Johanna is bursting with a creative energy that both impresses and exasperates her teachers. Answering a call for hip young gunslingers, she heads to London for an interview at the punningly-named music paper “D&ME”, where she learns that an unbridled passion for the Annie soundtrack isn’t what the edgy rock press want.So, armed with less than tenner’s worth of hair colouring and accoutrements, Johanna reinvents herself as bad girl Dolly Wilde, a top-hat wearing whirlwind who wins awards for telling pop stars to follow Kurt Cobain’s example and shoot themselves – albeit with a searing wit that none of her colleagues can match.Directed by Coky Giedroyc (who made Stella Does Tricks and Women Talking Dirty), How to Build a Girl has a rough-and-ready energy that’s hard to resist, even during its creakier moments of narrative contrivance. At times I was reminded of Gurinder Chadha’s underrated Blinded By the Light, another semi-autobiographical picture (adapted by Sarfraz Manzoor from his own memoir), which sprinkled its streetwise tale with elements of ecstatic musical fantasia. There’s a similar magic at work here, not least in a lovely scene where pop idol John Kite (Alfie Allen) steps out of a bus shelter poster to walk Johanna/Dolly home through the rain, glowing like a matinee idol.“Have you ever read On the Road?” asks Björk (Patsy Ferran) from a picture on a toilet wall, as Johanna hides under a sink (a recurrent cowering trope). “Don’t bother – it’s a very long book about a man getting a lift.” Instead, she recommends Little House on the Prairie, because “she makes her own knickers and her dad shoots a bear. That’s a story!” This, of course, is vintage Moran, mixing erudition with comic deflation to quotably laugh-out-loud effect.It’s a credit to Feldstein that the wobbliness of her Wolverhampton accent never comes between us and her character. Instead, we simply get on board with her adventures, accepting her for what she is – however odd that may sometimes sound. There are top supporting turns too from Paddy Considine as Johanna’s wannabe rock star dad, and Sarah Solemani as her mum, wrestling postnatal depression and exhaustion, but still strangely indomitable.It seems particularly poignant that How to Build a Girl is opening in the UK the same week that Q magazine announced it was closing – another victim of coronavirus chaos. For all its flaws, the UK music press offered a way in for writers who (like Moran) would go on to become “voices of their generation”. Perhaps somewhere, a teenager watching this boisterous romp will get the same boost from its rip-it-up-and-start-again message. Heaven knows we could all use a bit of positive reinvention right now.

Stage Mother review – feelgood drag film falls flat,"A small-town Texas choir director takes over a California drag joint, with mixed results",2,"Jacki Weaver’s Maybelline Metcalf is a tough Texan mama bear and director of her small-town church choir, a fine fit for the Australian actor’s natural matriarchal authority. “I don’t storm, I flounce,” Maybelline says. Her maternal instincts come to the fore when her estranged gay son dies suddenly and she ends up inheriting his failing San Francisco drag joint, taking his gang of misfit colleagues and friends under her wing.Her waifs and strays include single mother Sienna (Lucy Lui), lip syncing drag queens Cherry Poppins (Tangerine’s Mya Taylor), Joan of Arkansas (Allister MacDonald) and Tequila Mockingbird (Oscar Moreno), who she coaxes into using their real voices, and her late son’s sceptical boyfriend (a bizarrely cast Adrian Grenier), who she wins over with her plans to revive the club. A further demonstration of “solidarity” sees her wearing a slash of glitter lipgloss and belting out Bonnie Tyler’s Total Eclipse of the Heart. Queer Canadian film-maker Thom Fitzgerald cheerfully attempts to bridge the gap between two disparate communities, but Maybelline’s swift acceptance of and affection towards her son’s chosen family suggests she didn’t have far to go in the first place. The feelgood tone feels a little flaccid."
Clemency review – Alfre Woodard quietly dazzles in this superb death row drama,Woodard plays a conflicted prison warden slowly unravelling in writer-director Chinonye Chukwu’s remarkable film,5,"Amid the many oversights of January’s Oscar nominations, Alfre Woodard’s absence from the best actress shortlist was particularly telling. Having earned a supporting actress nomination for Cross Creek in the 80s, Woodard hit a career high in this deceptively low-key death row drama from writer-director Chinonye Chukwu, who last year became the first black woman to win the US dramatic grand jury prize at Sundance. As the warden in a maximum security prison facing a crisis of faith in her work and her life, Woodard is brilliantly measured and understated, a quality that (as Michael B Jordan’s similarly snubbed performance in Just Mercy proved) rarely attracts Oscar attention.Woodard plays Bernadine Williams, who prides herself on treating her inmates with dignity as they move through incarceration to whatever awaits – whether that be freedom or death. From the prison gates, the chants of protesters provide a constant background noise, which she zones out even as it seeps into her office. Yet Bernadine is having doubts about the death penalty – doubts that turn into cold-sweat fears when a botched procedure reveals the true horror of execution.With her marriage to Jonathan (Wendell Pierce) cracking under the strain of work (“Mine is not a job, it’s a profession,” she tells him), Bernadine faces another traumatic event – the increasingly hopeless fate of Anthony Woods (Aldis Hodge), who has spent 15 years on death row. Anthony’s lawyer, Marty (Richard Schiff), has uncovered plentiful evidence calling into question his client’s conviction. But with appeals exhausted, both Bernadine and Anthony are left watching the clock as the days, hours and minutes tick away. “When I win, my client gets to not die,” Marty tells Bernadine, before asking pointedly “How do you keep doing it?” “I give these men respect,” she replies. “You can’t save the world…”According to Woodard, inspiration for Clemency came in part from the pleas made by death row staff and wardens in the case of Troy Davis, executed in Georgia in 2011. As Woodard has said, their message was: “Not only do you need to spare this person’s life, you need to spare our lives, because this is what it does to us to take life.” That sense of the death penalty’s toll on all those it touches runs throughout Chukwu’s intelligent drama, in which everyone – prisoners, wardens, lawyers, chaplains – seem to be experiencing some form of collective PTSD.The genius of Woodard’s performance is the extent to which her demeanour – her stance, her stoicism, the modulation of her voice, even the rhythm of her breathing – tells us more about her character’s journey than verbal exposition ever could. The fact that Clemency approaches the subject of state execution from the perspective of a black female death-row warden is remarkable enough, flying in the face of several movie stereotypes, adding another layer of complexity to Bernadine’s struggles, both personal and political. But it takes an actor of Woodard’s calibre to show us how Bernadine arrived at this point, and why she finds herself so conflicted.Plaudits to Hodge, who mesmerises as the inmate facing death even as new life presents itself – albeit at a distance. A powerful scene in which Bernadine explains the execution procedure to Anthony plays out largely on Hodge’s face. As she speaks, he sits in silence, rhythmically shifting, absorbing the information; a symphony of shock, anger, and fear playing across his features, broken only by the tracks of his tears, and the sound of a single exhalation.While cinematographer Eric Branco discreetly cranks up the increasing sense of confinement (these walls are closing in), composer Kathryn Bostic’s score mingles with the electronic hum of prison doors; ethereal voices and eerily reversed screeches heard as if through glass, like a distant scream scratching at the edges of a nightmare. Clemency is available on Curzon Home Cinema and bohemiamedia.co.uk/Clemency"
Come As You Are review - a briskly unsentimental journey,Richard Wong explores sexuality and disability with candour in this comedy drama remake,3,"Scotty is a virgin. A paraplegic since birth, he blames his disability for his lack of success with the ladies. But, as his brutally candid friends point out, the main reason that Scotty fails to score is his horrible personality. A remake of the Belgian comedy drama Hasta La Vista, Come As You Are is a briskly unsentimental road trip, which follows Scotty (Grant Rosenmeyer), fellow wheelchair-user Matt (Hayden Szeto) and Mo (Ravi Patel), who is sight impaired, as they embark on a covert adventure to Canada and the Chateau Paradis, a brothel that caters specifically for differently abled clientele. Driving their minibus is Sam (Gabourey Sidibe), a no-nonsense former nurse, who earns their respect early on by threatening Scotty with physical violence after he persists in calling her “sweetheart”.The film loses points for its decision to cast able actors in the central roles, but explores its theme of sexuality and disability with admirable candour. An opening scene, which sees Scotty waking with the aftermath of an erotic dream prominently on display to his mother, gives a hint of his daily humiliations and explains the rough edges in his temperament. The screenplay, by Erik Linthorst, is particularly acute when it comes to tone-deaf empathy. “My cousin’s brother-in-law is Down syndrome,” says a traffic cop. “I get it.”Come As You Are is on Curzon Home Cinema, then multiple platforms"
Cruel Intentions review – young love still looks laboured 21 years on,"The rereleased tale of spoilt Manhattan rich kids, starring Ryan Phillippe, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Reese Witherspoon, remains creepily unconvincing",2,"In 1999, movie audiences were presented with this shrill twist on Laclos’s Dangerous Liaisons from writer-director Roger Kumble, which inelegantly laboured the cynicism of the original with a smirking 20th-century update. Jaded epicures Vicomte de Valmont and Marquise de Merteuil are reimagined as spoilt Manhattan rich kids Sebastian and Kathryn, step-siblings who have the creepily competitive quasi-incestuous hots for each other’s firm young bodies.They are played by Ryan Phillippe and Sarah Michelle Gellar. (Amy Adams took over the Kathryn role for a straight-to-DVD prequel in 2000; there was even a generic threequel in 2004, featuring Kathryn’s supposed cousin and in 2016 Kumble brought Gellar back as Kathryn, in a TV movie, playing a now middle-aged schemer.)Here, Kathryn challenges the notorious seducer Sebastian to apply his sulphurous charms to the super-virginal Annette (Reese Witherspoon), and, if he succeeds, Kathryn agrees to submit personally to his long-simmering and decadent desires: “You can put it anywhere!” Things go wrong when, to his own astonishment, Sebastian falls in love in Annette. Now this movie is getting a rerelease here for its 21st birthday (or its 20th when it came out in the US last year).Well, 1999 was a banner year for Hollywood pictures in many ways, but this really wasn’t one of the greats. Looking back, I see I found it laboured, and to me it doesn’t look much better now.Witherspoon, who created a masterpiece with her fierce performance in Alexander Payne’s Election that same year, is bland. So is Gellar – who often seems to have raided the grownups’ dressing up box. Phillippe does at least look and sound the part, zooming around in his gorgeous roadster. (No nonsense about seatbelts.) But his transformation into someone genuinely exalted by love is unconvincing, and the film’s satirical forays into the realms of gay sexuality and racism jar a bit. (Christine Baranski does admittedly have a good line when her character is outraged to be accused of bigotry: “My husband and I gave money to Colin Powell!”)There is some perspective to be gained now on this 90s period piece, with its Joe Eszterhas-type title, people still talking on payphones and Sebastian airily announcing: “Email is for geeks and paedophiles!” But the step-sibling idea looks very much as if it has been borrowed from Amy Heckerling’s 1996 movie Clueless (the two films have the same gag about gay people watching Spartacus on TV) but Clueless was a literary update that worked better with a lighter and more humorous touch.Phillippe plays a very 90s Bret Easton Ellis-type character, and he might have been interesting casting as Patrick Bateman in the film version of American Psycho, a role that went to Christian Bale. Times change, and this is of course very much a pre-BLM, pre-#MeToo piece. It might have dated less if wasn’t quite so pleased with itself. Cruel Intentions is available on Amazon Prime Video."
Disappearance at Clifton Hill review – dark tale of childhood trauma,David Cronenberg makes a startling appearance as a frogman in this bizarre psycho-melodrama set near Niagara Falls,3,"A young woman, haunted by her past, gazes thoughtfully out over a dark stretch of water. Suddenly, there is a ripple and someone in a frogman’s outfit emerges, splashes up to her, removes his mask and – oh, yikes, yikes and triple yikes – it’s only David Cronenberg, that’s all! The great film-maker’s wacky appearance in this movie, playing a conspiracist true-crime podcaster, sets a keynote of weirdo menace. Yet the guiding deity is probably David Lynch, with something of Atom Egoyan in the film’s dash of preposterous psycho-melodrama and the dark return of the repressed.Tuppence Middleton gives a sharp and engaging performance as Abby, who was traumatised by a sinister incident when she was seven years old, near the family home at Niagara Falls, on the Canadian side of the border. She witnessed a kidnapping, but as a child did not have the maturity to understand what she’d seen, nor the vocabulary to explain it. The burden of this unprocessed memory has left her traumatised in adult life and, when she returns to her hometown on the death of her mother, Abby begins to wonder if she can solve this coldest of cold cases – with Cronenberg’s help perhaps.It’s a pretty bizarre film, a thriller that appears partly to be composed of delusions and hallucinations, building to a shaggy-dog ending that wraps things up, though in a faintly exasperating way. Abby finds that the kidnapping may have something to do with a local Vegas-style magic act called The Magnificent Moulins (played by Marie-Josée Croze and Paulino Nunes) whose promotional videocassette she borrows from the library – the cue for some pleasingly retrograde, old-tech fetishism. Director and co-writer Albert Shin has come up with a diverting exercise in noir style. Disappearance at Clifton Hill is available on digital platforms from 20 July."
Litigante review - bracing portrait of a Colombian woman on the verge,A single-parent lawyer and her vitriolic mother fight almost to the death in this superbly acted domestic drama,4,"There’s an abrasively realist candour to this Colombian portrait of a woman pushed to the brink by the incremental stresses of her daily life. Silvia (Carolina Sanín) is a single parent, a public-sector lawyer tainted by a brewing scandal, and the daughter of Leticia (Leticia Gómez), an explosively ill-tempered widow who responds to her cancer diagnosis with chain-smoking and vitriol.It’s this latter element that brings the film, directed by Franco Lolli, its arcing, unpredictable energy. The relationship between Silvia and Leticia is like a magnifying mirror, bouncing and building their matching antagonism. Both performances are superb, but Gómez, as the razor-tongued matriarch, is particularly bracing. Even as she sinks towards death, the sharp edge of her perennial displeasure cuts through her weakness.Meanwhile, Silvia’s son has inherited the family anger management issues, and Silvia listens with barely concealed irritation as his teachers voice their concerns about an incident involving a toy kitchen. More like snapshots from a family album than a neatly tied up journey, Litigante delivers emotional authenticity and a raw open wound of an ending.Litigante is on Curzon Home Cinema, with a live Q&A on Monday 13 July at 8.30pm with director Franco Lolli and star Carolina Sanín"
"Saint Frances review – wry, tender, taboo-busting drama","Writer Kelly O’Sullivan stars in her bittersweet tale of a child-phobic waitress turned nanny, an exhilarating examination of female lives on screen",5,"Reviewing Eliza Hittman’s powerfully understated drama Never Rarely Sometimes Always in this paper recently, I noted that by approaching the urgent subject of reproductive rights through the prism of a coming-of-age story with road-movie inflections, Hittman’s film avoided ever seeming polemical.The same is true of this terrific (and very different) feature from writer and star Kelly O’Sullivan, a vibrant and emotionally engaging tale that dresses its subversive self-determination manifesto in the clothes of a ditzy, bittersweet comedy about midlife disappointment.Laughing and crying my way through Saint Frances (the deserving winner of several major festival audience awards), I was reminded of the outraged reactions that greeted Gillian Robespierre’s 2014 comedy Obvious Child, with one conservative critic carping: “If America laughs at this, America is beyond redemption.” Yet by refusing to accept the taboo status afforded to such everyday subjects as menstruation, birth control, abortion and postnatal depression, O’Sullivan brilliantly injects a radical element into this wryly tender portrait of an anxious single woman pinballing between jobs, relationships and uncertain life goals.We first meet O’Sullivan’s Bridget at a party, listening in bemused horror to a middle-aged man’s indulgent nightmares of failure, cut short by her own deadpan declaration that she’s a 34-year-old waitress – or, as she puts it, “a server”. After hooking up with the younger Jace (Max Lipchitz), Bridget finds herself facing an unwanted pregnancy at around the same time that fate conspires to offer her new employment, nannying for six-year-old Frances (Ramona Edith Williams, channelling the unmannered precocious energy of The Florida Project’s Brooklynn Kimberly Prince).Overwhelmed by the arrival of their new baby, well-to-do lesbian couple Maya (Charin Alvarez) and Annie (Lily Mojekwu) rope Bridget in for summer-season childcare, despite the fact that she’s clearly unprepared for parenting – surrogate or otherwise. Will her avowed child-phobia (“You must really like kids”; “I don’t”) prevent her from doing the job? And what will her employers, one of whom is devoutly religious, think of her own decision to have a termination?Directed with loose-limbed intimacy by O’Sullivan’s real-life partner Alex Thompson, Saint Frances (the title implies healing, but also nods towards a wonderfully playful confession scene) benefits from Nate Hurtsellers’s hand-held cinematography, capturing these characters with empathetic candour. Whether it’s the discovery of menstrual blood on bedsheets after a night of energetic love-making with Jace, or a long-lens exchange between Bridget and Frances on a suburban street, we get the sense of eavesdropping on genuine encounters, in all their raggedy richness.At times we’re left laughing heartily at life’s absurdities – a scene in which Bridget mock-scolds Frances by bumping her push-buggy, only for the child to cry out in delight (“Again!”), is a smile-raising treat. Elsewhere, there’s a beautifully sardonic edge to the comedy, typified by Jim True-Frost’s excruciating guitar-teacher-guru Isaac, who thinks his musical compositions are divinely inspired, and who views contraception as women’s work.What’s most impressive, however, is the degree to which the incidental details of this frank and feisty film ring true. Like Michaela Coel’s outstanding BBC TV series I May Destroy You, Saint Frances expands the representation of women’s lives on screen in a way that is so casual you hardly notice it’s happening. Indeed, when Bridget finally gets to say exactly what she thinks about the events that define this drama, her words (which amount to a mission statement) are framed within a throwaway comedic device that undercuts her honesty with a hilariously dry punchline. It’s just one instance of the delicate balancing act that this gently marvellous movie gets just right.Saint Frances opens in cinemas later this month (postponed at late notice from 17 July)"
The Old Guard review – Charlize Theron has an axe to grind,Theron lets rip as immortal warrior Andy in Gina Prince Bythewood’s fast-paced but patchy comic-book adaptation,3,"Who wants to live for ever? Not Charlize Theron, evidently. Playing immortal warrior Andy, leader of a covert band of unkillable mercenaries, Theron spends almost as much time battling many centuries worth of accumulated angst as she does slicing and dicing entire battalions of attackers. Armed with ennui and an ancient axe, Theron brings layers of complexity to a role that is otherwise largely defined through exemplary fight choreography.Gina Prince-Bythewood’s crisp, efficient direction of this adaptation of an action-fantasy comic-book series by Greg Rucka serves the physical element of the performances well. A fight on a rattling cargo plane between Theron and KiKi Layne (playing Nile, a reluctant new recruit to the immortal club) is a blast. Even Andy cracks a smile at one point. “She stabbed me,” Theron’s character later tells her right-hand man, Booker (Matthias Schoenaerts). “I think she has potential.”Where the film is less well supported is in the screenplay, which Rucka himself adapted, and which gets bogged down in some decidedly muddy character motivation at a crucial point. Equally tone deaf is a score that sidesteps the timelessness of the central characters, feeling more disposable than eternal. Still, there’s plenty to enjoy, not least Layne’s terrific turn as the newbie with a fresh take on forever.The Old Guard is on Netflix"
I Am Vengeance: Retaliation review – Stu Bennett cries foul and tackles Vinnie Jones,Ross Boyask’s sequel John Gold military payback movie is post-pub fare that displays a pure-hearted passion for movie-making,2,"John Gold is back – all 6ft 7in of him. After making his debut in 2018’s I Am Vengeance, the mild-mannered ex-forces hardman played by former WWE wrestler and bare-knuckle boxer Stu Bennett gets a sequel. The first of many, no doubt. This time, Gold is heading up the crew tasked with bringing in a traitor and former comrade in arms (Vinnie Jones). In exchange, Gold will receive an unofficial government pardon for all the military rule-bending he got up to in the first film.The script efficiently dispenses with such necessary exposition in a few lines of dialogue: “Elite operative gone rogue” … something something … “black site facility” … something something. Then they’re off, bouncing from punch-up to car crash to punch-up, then another punch-up, with some barracks banter in between. (The budgets of British action flicks rarely stretch to Die Hard-style explosions.)This is the kind of film where the fight choreographer (Tim Man) gets higher billing than the director of photography (Simon Rowling), and Jones stands out for his naturalistic acting abilities. Seriously, though, Jones has a genuine charisma and a light comic touch evident since the Lock Stock days, and he applies both to playing the amiably amoral villain Sean Teague, with pleasing results. No one else in this can really act, but they can all fight, including the women, and I Am Vengeance is impressively equal opportunities when it comes to divvying up screen time.For all its rough edges, there’s a pure-hearted passion for movie-making evident here, that’s often awol in slicker productions. You have also got to admire writer-director Ross Boyask’s thick-skinned productivity. He’s going to keep on churning out this post-pub fare until he runs out of synonyms for “vengeance”, isn’t he? And there’s nothing a bunch of film snobs can do about it. I Am Vengeance: Retaliation is available on digital platforms from 13 July."
Desperados review – hit-and-miss Netflix comedy offers throwaway summer fun,A trio of friends head to Mexico to delete a drunken email in a mostly entertaining if a little scattershot comedy,3,"While Netflix has been trying (and, in my opinion, mostly failing) to resurrect the romantic comedy, it has also been quietly attempting to reinvigorate a subgenre that studios have spent even less time and money on. When Bridesmaids became Judd Apatow’s biggest-ever hit as producer or director, scooping up enthused reviews and two Oscar nominations along the way, many expected that more would follow, studio comedies that centred on groups of female friends who were allowed to be more than just idealised or demonised girlfriends and wives.But it’s been a slow slog, with the past decade scattered with just Girls Trip, Rough Night and two Bad Moms films (both clearly, awkwardly written by straight men), leaving Netflix to pick up the slack.While not exactly slam-dunks, films like Dude, Ibiza, Wine Country, Someone Great and Otherhood have all lightly scratched a growing itch and have collectively provided more entertainment than the platform’s more trumpeted romcom renaissance. Dropping into the middle of an unusually sparse summer season is Desperados, another mixed bag of lewd humour, female bonding and vaguely recognisable actors you liked from that thing you can’t fully remember. It’s imperfect, sometimes frustratingly so, but also just about fun enough for yet another tipsy Friday night locked down indoors, its sun-drenched setting proving alluring and yet cruelly out of reach.Wesley (Saturday Night Live alum Nasim Pedrad) is not living the life she wanted. She’s in her late 30s, unemployed, single and stealing the food of children she babysits for. When she finds out her ex is getting married, she’s determined to make a sudden friend-engineered set-up work. But on the date, she lets herself be a little too candid and he quickly shares his lack of interest. On her way out of the bar, she trips and is promptly saved by handsome stranger Jared (Robbie Amell). A whirlwind romance ensues, but when Jared goes awol after they first have sex, she’s convinced that yet another guy has ghosted her. With the help of her two best friends Brooke and Kaylie (Anna Camp and Sarah Burns) and far too many bottles of wine, she decides to send a furious email, calling out his perceived bad behaviour as well as his other faults – “Please stop hashtagging all of your Instagrams #photography. Everything on Instagram is a photograph” – but just as the send button is being pressed, she finally hears from him in the hospital. He was in an accident in Mexico which left him in a coma, unable to reach her, and he’s yet to check his phone, which is locked away in his hotel room.And so begins a frantic, ill-advised trek to Mexico as the three try to find his room and prevent him from seeing just how unhinged Wesley can be. It’s this desire to disguise the real, messy, drunk, angry, irrational you from someone you’ve just started dating that’s one of the sharper observations in a film that too often opts for easy, dumb laughs. After being “too real” with guys and driving them away, Wesley pretends to be what she thinks a man like Jared wants: a passive, salad-eating housewife-in-training who doesn’t ever lose her cool. Jared’s good looks and superficial maturity (“He wants kids and owns a duvet cover”) makes his regressive gender expectations more palatable as well as Wesley’s age and exhaustion at the process of dating. It’s all complicated further when her earlier bad date Sean (New Girl’s Lamorne Morris) also happens to be at the same resort, especially as he’s already seen the real Wesley.The script, from TV writer Ellen Rapoport, provides Pedrad with many, many opportunities to embarrass herself, but it’s the smaller moments that stick, rather than the more exaggerated physical comedy. Signposted pratfalls, a consistently unfunny running joke about Wesley being a paedophile, and a bizarre scene involving a dolphin penis all prove tiresome, like they were grafted on from a Farrelly brothers film circa the late 1990s. While Pedrad can make for an excellent sketch comic (her Kim Kardashian impression being an SNL highlight), and while there is an easy chemistry between her and Morris (on charming form), she plays too much of the film with a sitcom-level broadness, causing one to wonder what an actor with a more believably specific awkwardness could do with the role. It’s hard not to compare her to Kristen Wiig, another SNL comedian who played a similar can’t-get-her-shit-together role in Bridesmaids, but Wiig is a skilled tragicomic actor able to modulate more delicately between big and small, able to evoke sympathy and laughter in the tiniest of facial movements.It still zips by with enough energy, because in among the many misses there are still some hits, and its pace is so relentless it’s hard not get swept up. While Camp and Burns are underused, this becomes a smartly handled and rarely crystallised plot point. So often in films within this subgenre, with one central character dominating those that surround them, the friends find their own issues and concerns de-prioritised and for once, this becomes a valid cause of conflict in the third act and it’s the more grounded ideas like this that make the film’s laboured silliness grate that much more.As sunny, throwaway summer fun, Desperados just about hits the spot although like its main characters, you’d be best spending the runtime with a steady supply of alcohol at hand.Desperados is now available on Netflix"
Think Like a Dog review – Feds bark as pet wisdom melts into syrup,A tech-whiz schoolboy discovers how to communicate with wisecracking the family hound in this lightweight adventure,2,"They say an actor should never work with animals or children. But a kid and a talking dog are the best things about this otherwise pretty hopeless attempt at a Jason Bourne-style adventure for under-nines, set in the cool world of tech. Gabriel Bateman is very likable as a teenage science whiz, but he has his work cut out in scenes opposite his screen mum and dad – a pair of terrifically wooden performances by Megan Fox and Josh Duhamel.Bateman is 13-year-old Oliver, the star pupil at a school for superbrains. He has spent months making a telepathy machine for his school science fair. After a spot of hacking to power up, his machine causes a power surge, and Oliver discovers he can communicate with his pet dog Henry (voiced by Todd Stashwick as a lovable cheerful wisecracker). Pretty soon, the FBI’s cyber security unit is on his tail. An eccentric tech billionaire (Kunal Nayyar) is sniffing around, too. Oliver’s mum and dad are too distracted by their failing marriage to notice – the two are meant to be at the eye-rolling stage of mutual contempt, but Fox and Duhamel look so blank it’s hard to tell.It’s nice to see a world in which geeks really might be taking over. At Oliver’s specialist technology school, even the bully is a nerd (“I’m going to crush you like Edison crushed Tesla”). But this film isn’t really about science. Pretty soon the script melts into a syrupy slush of a storyline about how Henry the dog can teach the emotionally inferior humans a thing or two about what really matters. Low IQ entertainment whatever your age. Think Like a Dog is available on digital platforms from 6 July."
Inheritance review – preposterous and paper-thin New York thriller,The daughter of a dead tycoon is cheated of her rightful millions and bequeathed a mysterious inhabited bunker in this implausible caper,1,"It’s bold of Lily Collins, daughter of Phil Collins, to star in a psychological thriller called Inheritance. She stars as Lauren Monroe, dynasty scion and – despite looking all of 12 years old – the district attorney for Manhattan. Gossip Girl’s Chace Crawford plays her congressional candidate brother, giving the early scenes a Boss Baby feel, as these two stomp around town dishing out orders with zero personal authority. Adorable. When their tycoon father dies (Patrick Warburton, AKA Puddy from Seinfeld – also glaringly miscast), Lauren is shafted out of her fair share of his millions and instead bequeathed a secret bunker on the family grounds. This might have been valuable New York real estate, were it not for the mysterious man (Simon Pegg in a comically dishevelled wig) who has been kept prisoner there for decades.The characters are paper-thin and, even on paper, their motivations don’t make much sense. Thus liberated from the constraints of plausible human behaviour, you’d hope for Inheritance to have fun with preposterous plotting. There are shots of a chess board with scattered pieces (movie shorthand for brilliant-but-disordered minds) and some frantic cross-cutting, but otherwise it’s well into the film’s final third before anything resembling action occurs. And that long-telegraphed twist, when it comes, is hardly worth the wait.In the meantime, we, too, are left to moulder in the bunker, as Lauren, apparently lacking even basic investigative skills – sorry, how did she get to be DA again? – tries and fails to discover the identity of her inherited prisoner. Hopefully Pegg’s wig negotiated a percentage of the backend. It’s doing the most work here to keep us entertained. Inheritance is available on digital platforms from 6 July and on DVD on 13 July."
Infamous review – a gonzo shot at radical outlaw glamour,A wannabe Bonnie and Clyde for the social-media age team up to find fame as travelling armed robbers in this patchy romp,2,"The performances are a couple of drawers down from the top in this Nouveau Bonnie and Clyde romp; it features Bella Thorne – from the recent teen-abstinence weepie Midnight Sun – in glassy-eyed Insta princess mode. She’s playing Arielle, a bored pouty badass in Florida, longing to get away from all the local losers and find fame and fortune.Arielle hooks up with smouldering hottie Dean (Jake Manley) who’s out on parole for armed robbery and together they take off across country on a crime spree, holding up gas stations – escapades that Arielle videos and posts online: she is electrified to see how she and Dean are blowing up on social media.But wait. Surely that makes them traceable? Well, no, the script perfunctorily says that Arielle has put in place an “IP blocker”. Erm … would this kind of expertise be available to the non-nerd community? I’m not sure.Finally, our two desperadoes come across a young African-American woman, Elle (Amber Riley), who appears to be part of the online fanbase. It is her job to assure us, the audience, that we should be rooting for Arielle and Dean because they have radical outlaw glamour, giving a voice to the downtrodden and dispossessed.There are one or two gonzo shootouts that, admittedly, go with a swing, but this isn’t great. It’s never easy to represent online existence in a feature film and this is another movie that has fallen short. Some serviceable action sequences, though. Infamous is available on digital platforms from 31 July."
Shepherd: The Hero Dog review – Nazi-era drama strikes the right tone,"A family of German Jews are separated from their pet by Nuremburg laws in this honest, unsentimental film",3,"In 1930s Germany, the thoroughly assimilated Jewish Schoenmann family welcome the arrival of a litter of puppies when Anya, their pedigree German shepherd, gives birth in their sun-splashed flat. Although young Joshua (August Maturo) and his sister Rachel (Viktoria Stefanovszky) plead with them to keep the lot, his parents insist that only one puppy can be kept; the rest must be rehomed. The lucky pup who stays, a male named Kaleb, forms an intense bond with young master Jacob.Naturally, these opening 10 minutes or so foreshadow the tragedies to come. Soon the Nazis bring in the Nuremburg race laws and the family have their rights and safety eroded bit by bit, including the right to own pets. Jacob and Kaleb are separated, but God, ever the mysterious way-worker and crafter of movie-logic ironies, ensures that they are eventually reunited in a concentration camp. By this point Kaleb is being cared for by a Nazi guard (Ken Duken, packing a disturbingly attractive Ralph-Fiennes-in-Schindler’s-List-style smoulder) and Jacob is a starving prisoner.Based on an Israeli novel by Asher Kravitz but produced by a US-based company with American director Lynn Roth and shot mostly in Hungary with a largely east European cast, this is a fittingly diasporic production for the subject matter. There’s a palpable sense that the package is designed for multigenerational viewing, using the cute puppies to lure in the kids before delivering an honest but palatable history lesson about the Holocaust. As such, it succeeds in walking the tonal high beam without falling into soul-destroying bleakness on one side or a saccharinely fake happy ending on the other. That’s no mean feat.Given that accomplishment, it’s maybe a little churlish to complain that the acting is sometimes a bit wooden and the story beats are often on the nose. The dogs, however, are adorable, especially the motley pack a homeless Kaleb falls in with halfway through, a few of whom might have been canine extras in Kornel Mundruczo’s White God from 2014. Shepherd: The Hero Dog is on digital platforms from 29 June. This article was amended on 1 July 2020 after an editorial error mixed up the names of three actors and the characters they were playing. This has now been corrected."
Irresistible review – Jon Stewart’s political non-satire for liberals is as dull as it gets,Steve Carell is lacklustre as a political strategist for the Democrats in this flaccid film that sits on the fence,1,"Jon Stewart made his reputation as a smart political comedian and commentator on Comedy Central’s The Daily Show on TV, before quitting in 2015 to develop movie projects, of which the first was his excellent Rosewater. But this – heartsinkingly – is the follow-up. It’s a flaccid, toothless, supercilious political non-satire for liberals too fastidious to take sides or take action. The film perches on a fence of wry disdain and makes droll gestures of disapproval at the wasteful big-money awfulness of everyone’s political campaign. And it’s leading to a big tortuous plot twist which frankly isn’t convincing, despite the talking-head expert interviewee who is wheeled on over the closing credits to assure us that it is. What we’re left with is a bland cop-out, which incidentally won’t worry anyone yearning for Donald Trump’s second term.Steve Carell finds some of his dullest form playing Gary Zimmer, a Washington DC political strategist for the Democratic party, desperately searching for the next big thing after the debacle of 2016. (Stewart may have been inspired by Stanley Tucci’s media-manipulator in the small-town political satire Swing Vote.) To Zimmer’s astonished delight, one of his minions finds a viral YouTube video of a retired Marine Corps veteran called Colonel Jack Hastings, played by Chris Cooper, giving a passionate speech about caring community values at a town-hall meeting somewhere in Wisconsin, where folks have been financially stricken by the recent army-base closure. The holy grail: a tough guy who’s also a progressive.Cunning Zimmer duly shows up in hicksville (wrinkling his nose at all the niceness thereabouts) to persuade the grumpily authentic Hastings to run as a Dem for mayor and maybe something more if it all works out. Soon the top brass in Washington are excited; the cash rolls in for his campaign and the Republicans get fired up too – bringing in their ice-queen spin-doctor Faith Brewster, played by Rose Byrne, who seems to have some history and toxic sexual chemistry with Zimmer.There are, arguably, one or two reasonable touches, such as the observation about punctuation on billboard ads, inspired by the notorious “Jeb!” campaign for the hapless Jeb Bush. But really, any single TV episode of Veep or Parks and Recreation has far more wit, fun and political zap than this great big laugh-free feast of self-congratulatory dullness. Zimmer himself never has any funny lines and the rules about making the leading man relatable – and making the Democratic guy basically nice – mean that he is never allowed to have any of that Satanic political glamour of pure wickedness that might have made his character interesting. The movie never permits itself the forbidden fossil-fuel of cynicism that might have given it some movement.The talents of Topher Grace and Natasha Lyonne are thrown away in the tiny roles of pollsters and online number-crunchers that Zimmer has brought in. It could be that much of their characters were lost in the edit, but certainly the film is not especially interested in the hot-button issues of Facebook and data-harvesting. The eerie absence of race as an issue in the film is also naive.The story runs on predictable lines, with the underdog Hastings making exciting gains on the Republican incumbent; then his momentum stalls and there’s a dilemma – how nasty are his team prepared to be to clinch their win? And there’s that very exasperating ending, to which I can only say that in the real world, Zimmer, having raised serious amounts of cash from hedge-funders and the like, would take a pretty close interest in the bottom line.The real finale, however, comes in the typography: the word “RESIST” is eye-catchingly picked out in the middle of the title, in fine Michael-Moore-lite style. Resist? Really? How? The movie has signed off with a pert little flourish to the effect that the whole system is broken, so maybe we should wish a plague on both their houses or neither. Either way, the supposed satirical attitude of Irresistible can’t conceal the fact that it’s contrived, unfunny and redundant. Released on 26 June on digital formats."
From Centre Stage to You Got Served: why dance movies are the ultimate comfort-watch,"Whether it’s a wrong-side-of-the-tracks tale or a wannabe trying to make it big, these are guilty pleasures to not feel guilty about",0,"Until the last few, system-destroying weeks, 2020 has been all about comfort. Comfort food, comfy clothes, creature comforts and comforting films and TV shows. Like many, my lockdown comfort viewing has meant revisiting old favourites, a list that includes a presumably higher than average representation of dance movies.I freaking love dance movies. Even the bad ones. They trigger the little girl in me who dreamed of dancing backup for Janet Jackson, Paula Abdul and Madonna. They’re the guilty pleasures I do not at all feel guilty about. They are to me what action films are to accountants, Marvel movies to meteorologists. They give me life. And jazz hands.English-speaking dance movies range in style from critically acclaimed balletic masterpieces The Red Shoes, The Turning Point and Black Swan, to quasi-musical dramedies Strictly Ballroom, Billy Elliot and A Chorus Line, to plot-light dance battle porn, Stomp the Yard, Street Dance 3D and the Step Up franchise.As a 1980s kid, my heart will always belong to the holy trinity of cult favourites Dirty Dancing, Flashdance and Footloose. Of the three, however, only Footloose is currently available on subscription streaming services in Australia. So during isolation, I’ve been all about the early 2000s, a decade as rich in dance films as it was in cat memes and low-rise jeans.I’m talking Honey, Save the Last Dance, Centre Stage, You Got Served, Magic Mike, Stomp the Yard. I’m talking Jessica Alba, Channing Tatum, Julia Stiles, Mekhi Phifer, Ginuwine and Ne-Yo. (I’m also talking the original Step Up and the technically dance-adjacent Bring it On, but they’re only available to rent or buy on YouTube and Google Play.)Rewatching these titans of the genre, it struck me that something equal parts terrible and amazing happened to dance movies at the turn of the millennium. They got cheesier. Much, much cheesier. Gone was any pretence of nuance and artistry, replaced wholly by formulas and risk aversion. It’s like at the end of the 1990s, somebody decided the key to box-office success lay in schmaltzy, saturated pageantry. And it worked.Since long before Y2K, four tropes have formed the plots of most dance films: uptight girl and boy from the wrong side of the tracks dance (and pash) through their differences; small-town wannabe takes a midnight train to the big smoke; person is forbidden from dancing but secretly keeps dancing; down-on-their-luck hip hop crew enter competition possibly judged by Lil’ Kim.All tropes come complete with a moral or life lesson about prejudice or tenacity or not putting babies in corners. But while their pre-21st century counterparts could be solemn in their sermonising, more recent dance movies make it fun. They may be as corny as an Olsen Twin double-bill but they’re twerking while preaching so it’s OK.Centre Stage, for example, is crammed so full of the tropes, characters, morals and melodrama synonymous with the genre, it’s canon. Three young ingenues training for the American Ballet grapple with the pressures of leotards, life and love. Each must confront her demons as she dances: unshakeable apathy, a terrible attitude, or a body that refuses to conform to the insane weight standards of professional ballet. There’s a bad boy, a good boy and the overriding message that you should follow your passions and trust your heart. Plus, Sandy “father of Seth” Cohen (Peter Gallagher) is in it so that’s an instant four-star rating.And from Swan Lake to Snoop Dog, You Got Served delivers street dance glory with extra cheese and a script so bad it’s beautiful. BFFs Elgin and David get into a spot of bother with their friendly neighbourhood crime boss and set their sights on winning the biggest battle their town has ever seen. A rival dance crew, forbidden love and bros-before-ladies betrayal put their bond and their futures to the test, but dancing saves Christmas and everyone learns that friendship is the real winner in the end.Another great thing about dance movies from 2000 onwards is that they finally brought greater diversity to the genre, at least in terms of race and sexuality. It’s somewhat ironic, considering the importance of dance to so many communities outside the straight, white mainstream. There’s still a long road to full inclusivity, in going beyond stereotypes, casting people with disabilities and across the gender spectrum, but it’s much rarer to only see straight, white people sashaying across the screen.Dance movies made between 2000 and 2010 and beyond sit comfortably in a proven Venn diagram where cringe meets climax. They’re the perfect example of why we love so-bad-it’s-good cinema and a peppy distraction from all this year has wreaked. There are many dance movies available to stream – Centre Stage, You Got Served, Magic Mike, Save the Last Dance and Stomp the Yard are all on Netflix"
Empire Records: 90s cult classic starring Liv Tyler and Renée Zellweger is ripe for a comeback,What’s not to love about a band of scrappy teenage misfits and a music store so cool even shoplifters wanted to work there?,0,"If the idea of a “dream job” is a myth, the employees at indie record store Empire Records didn’t get that memo. For them – self-identifying misfits and weirdos, prone to petty crime – the shop floor was a place where obeying societal norms didn’t count for much.It’s 1995 in Delaware, US, an era in which music was becoming increasingly commodified with the rise of CD sales, and placing celebrities on a Swarovski crystal pedestal was considered the norm. Inevitably, everything that was once good and sacred about music fandom was under threat.The film turns 25 this year and it’s having a moment. A cinematic underdog that bombed on release, it’s now a respected cultural touchstone. It’s not just a heady dose of nostalgia for an era where dancing on rooftops or singing along with the Cranberries was normal. It’s also grown into a go-to comfort watch for a generation who might need to remember the value of being understood over betraying their sense of self for a bit of easy cash and glory.The plot follows a day in the life of a gang of teenaged staff as they realise that their place of work is being sold to a soulless corporate giant. Gambling money away in Atlantic City and an in-store event for a one-hit wonder isn’t helping the crisis. Not willing to give up without a fight, they decide to put on a raging street party for the neighbourhood. Their grand plan? Take back power by raising the money to save their beloved record store.The film gestures towards the tropes of a workplace comedy, without veering too far into the modern-day bureaucracy of Parks and Recreation or the subtle indignities of service work in Party Down. At Empire Records, time stopped and customers were willing to wait out major life crises or call back again after team bonding activities wrapped up.For a film about fandom, not everyone in the industry understood the appeal. Critic Roger Ebert famously gave the film a terrible review during its initial theatrical release. He confidently wrote it off as a 1.5-star-rated “lost cause” but (rightfully) predicted that the entire cast had better projects ahead of them. Empire’s store manager (Anthony LaPaglia) went on to win a Golden Globe. The wild child who wants to sing in a band (Renée Zellweger) went on to star in Jerry Maguire. The Harvard-bound good-girl-turned-celebrity-scandal (Liv Tyler) matured into an elf maiden in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. And risk-taking gambler and manager-in-training (Rory Cochrane) went on to a bigger part in another cult hit, Dazed and Confused.Based on screenwriter Carol Heikkinen’s real-life experiences of working at global music franchise Tower Records (which filed for bankruptcy in 2006, nearly a decade after the film’s release), Empire Records serves as a rare and beautiful time capsule.It’s a homage to an era in which every important moment in your teenage life was worthy of a thoughtfully selected soundtrack; where starting a band could make you a new person; when shaving your head and asking your team to stage your live funeral was an act of devoted friendship; when committing larceny was fine if you were saving what you loved; and music was listened to in a soundproof booth with headphones on, rather than streamed as a service.This isn’t to say the film doesn’t have its flaws. When the cast interacts outside of the store, there’s often a lack of chemistry. And somehow, in hindsight, it seems problematic that the entire trajectory of their lives depends on whether the store remains open for business.But what saves this film is its unselfconsciously optimistic, goofy, principled spirit. Empire Records was about seeing the silver lining even in the most terrible, scrape-the-bottom-of-the-barrel times, forming unlikely friendships and finding family at work, challenging the financial security and mediocrity of signing on the dotted line and “selling out”, and riding out the highs and lows of an industry in its doom-and-gloom phase.Empire Records was a place where even the odd shoplifter who wandered in wanted to work: sure, it wasn’t a fast-track to becoming a tech billionaire, and a night in Vegas would probably lead to you being handcuffed on the couch. But you had a boss who kicked out predatory pop stars to protect his employees, and colleagues who fostered an environment in which mental health was discussed openly and non-judgmentally (for the most part).With the rallying cry of “Damn the man, save the Empire!”, a generation of new fans crops up every few years or so, reminding us that it’s better to follow through on our dreams than give it all up for someone else’s. Empire Records is available to stream on YouTube Movies or Google Play"
Radioactive review – Marie Curie biopic fast-forwards to Hiroshima,Rosamund Pike plays the physicist with dignity and froideur in this respectful drama that shows her brilliant discoveries – and their effects ,3,"The Geiger counter is ticking moderately for this forthright biopic of Marie Curie, born Maria Skłodowska: the historic double-Nobel winner in physics for the discovery of radioactivity, and then in chemistry for the discovery of radium and polonium. Screenwriter Jack Thorne has adapted Lauren Redniss’s much admired graphic novel about Marie and her husband and scientific partner Pierre Curie (to whom the Nobel committee at first wanted to confer the prize without Marie – unable to believe that a woman could be important in scientific discovery). The Iranian-born French film-maker Marjane Satrapi directs.Marie is played with dignity and composure by Rosamund Pike, although with slightly more froideur than was perhaps the case. Sam Riley does a decent job of playing Pierre; Anya Taylor-Joy is Marie’s equally brilliant scientist daughter Irène and Simon Russell Beale has a harrumphing cameo as the young Marie’s beetle-browed doctoral supervisor, professor Gabriel Lippmann, who refuses to let her have the facilities that she needs. Despite the slightly schmaltzy meet-cute that the film contrives between Marie and Pierre, Pike is good at the abrupt and maladroit side of Marie, which coexists with a romantic streak, and her initial (well-founded) suspicion that Pierre’s interest in her work may simply end in his taking it over, without her getting any of the credit.The movie partly follows the classic period-biopic template with the story extending in flashback from Marie being wheeled into hospital with her final illness. But the narrative is more unusual and ambitious – with its stylised flashforward sequences showing the consequences of Marie’s discovery, occurring like dream-premonitions. There is a micro-drama of a child with cancer being treated with radiotherapy in the 1950s, and scenes showing the destruction of Hiroshima and US nuclear weapons testing. It is not easy to know how to take these sequences: they disrupt conventional storytelling in interesting ways, and yet it is disconcerting to see nuclear war as the obvious evil deployed effectively to “balance” the good implications of cancer treatment.The movie is on stronger ground simply showing Marie and Irène’s work with mobile field-hospital X-ray machines during the first world war. Satrapi’s autobiographical feature debut, Persepolis, in 2007 was partly about her immigrant experience, and for all that the film is cautiously respectful of Curie’s greatness, Satrapi shows the same warmth and empathy for Marie’s loneliness as a Polish woman who has to leave her homeland to find her future. It is a respectful portrait of a great woman in science – and I found myself wondering about the long-gestating biopic project on the chemist and X-ray crystallographer Rosalind Franklin, whose work on DNA was ignored by the Nobel committee, on the grounds that the prize can only go to living recipients. There was a very good BBC TV movie on the subject in 1987. Life Story starred Juliet Stevenson as Franklin, with Jeff Goldblum as James Watson and Tim Pigott-Smith as Francis Crick and was based on Watson’s own self-admiring account. A new version might take a different tack. Available on digital platforms from 15 June."
The Ground Beneath My Feet review – taut Austrian sibling psychodrama,High-flying Lola finds she has more in common with her mentally fragile sister than she’d thought in Marie Kreutzer’s atmospheric thriller,4,"Existing in the kind of corporate shark tank that has its own bravado slang for pulling a 48-hour shift takes a particular kind of ruthlessness. Excelling in that world, as Lola (Valerie Pachner) does, takes the kind of control and drive that leaves no margin for error, no leeway for any hint of weakness or failure. Which is why Lola guards the fact that her sister, Conny, has been institutionalised yet again for paranoid schizophrenia, suspecting correctly that Conny’s frailty will taint her own reputation in the eyes of her bosses.But while the chalk and cheese sisters initially seem worlds apart, this tightly focused psychological drama suggests, as Lola starts to lose faith in her own mental strength, that Conny’s hospital and Lola’s sterile conference rooms are not so very different after all. This oppressive, atmospheric Austrian drama takes the kind of alpha female high achiever familiar from Maren Ade’s Toni Erdmann, but undermines her with splinters of Hitchcockian paranoia.

Da 5 Bloods review – Spike Lee goes all out in Vietnam,"Four Vietnam vets reunite in a search for their fallen comrade – and some gold bullion – in Lee’s inventive, action-packed but disjointed all-star adventure",3,"Last year, Spike Lee won his first competitive Academy Award as co-writer of BlacKkKlansman, a stranger-than-fiction tale of an African-American cop infiltrating the Ku Klux Klan in the early 70s. That Lee should have achieved this victory in the same year that Do the Right Thing celebrated its 30th anniversary seemed significant, proving that this reliably provocative film-maker, now in his 60s, still had his finger on the pulse of modern America. Having addressed the role of African American soldiers in the second world war in Miracle at St Anna, Lee turns to Vietnam for his latest, which opens on Netflix amid a period of enormous turmoil. Boasting an all-star cast including Delroy Lindo, Clarke Peters and Chadwick Boseman, Da 5 Bloods follows a group of Vietnam vets who return to the country in which they fought “the American war”. Officially, they are there to locate and recover the remains of their fallen squad leader “Stormin’ Norman” (Boseman), a warrior, teacher and mentor (“our Malcolm and our Martin”). But they’re also on the trail of gold – a stash of bullion that they found and buried all those years ago.Developed by Lee and his regular collaborator Kevin Willmott from an original script by Danny Bilson and Paul De Meo, Da 5 Bloods opens in typically forthright fashion with historical footage of Muhammad Ali and Malcolm X, the latter declaring that “when you take 20 million black people and make them fight all your wars and pick all your cotton… sooner or later their allegiance towards you is going to wear thin”.This political thread is picked up in Ho Chi Minh City, where the reunited comrades (surreally framed against the backdrop of an Apocalypse Now disco bar) remember that “when we got back from ’Nam we didn’t get nothing but a hard time”. Yet Paul (Lindo) still voted for Trump, telling his friends that “I’m tired of not getting mine, man”, and insisting that it’s “time we got these freeloading immigrants off our backs and build that wall!” As Otis (Peters, brilliant as always) mockingly mimics fawning minstrelsy, Lee cuts to a Florida rally in 2016 where “Blacks for Trump” banners are held aloft, a moment of sublimely horrific comedy. Later we’ll hear recreations of Hanoi Hannah’s propaganda broadcasts targeting African American GIs (a silky smooth performance from Veronica Ngo) as Lee draws a line from slavery to soldiery and on to the current divide-and-rule unrest.All this is vintage Lee. What is less certain is the rather more awkward Three Kings-style adventure into which Da 5 Bloods mutates, as our antiheroes get chased, shot at and blown up in the jungles of modern-day Vietnam, selling their souls for gold like the fortune hunters in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. Flashbacks to the war are effectively invoked through 16mm footage in which cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel squeezes the widescreen frames of the present into the square newsreel format of the past. Yet these latterday scenes of chase and capture feel altogether less substantial, as if the reunited platoon have somehow strayed across genre lines into a different movie.Such tonal shifts are nothing new to Lee, whose most provocative works have combined tragedy and comedy, history and fiction, alienation and immersion, to powerful effect. While Martin Scorsese’s Netflix picture The Irishman used state-of-the-art special effects to digitally de-age its cast, Da 5 Bloods wastes no time (or money) trying to smooth over the dramatic contrivance of placing its ageing stars alongside the more youthful Chadwick Boseman in the flashback scenes. It’s a reminder that Lee has always embraced the theatricality and artifice of movies, most notably in 2015’s Chi-Raq. But while the changing moods of BlacKkKlansman seemed bold and audacious, the warring elements of Da 5 Bloods appear bolted together rather than alchemically mixed.Compare this to the Hughes brothers’ still underappreciated 1995 masterpiece Dead Presidents, which painted a more vivid picture of the toxic legacy of Vietnam, shifting effortlessly from coming-of-age story to war-is-hell drama to heist thriller, before climaxing in a cry of raw political outrage that seems even more relevant today.On the plus side, the ensemble cast (which also features Jonathan Majors, Norm Lewis, Mélanie Thierry, Isiah Whitlock Jr, Jean Reno and Paul Walter Hauser) is excellent, and Lee’s ear for a finely chosen tune remains sharp. Terence Blanchard’s rich score is interspersed with bursts of Marvin Gaye’s 1971 album What’s Going On, sometimes erupting as a group singalong, elsewhere surfacing as a plaintive solo voice. In many ways, Gaye’s musical masterpiece is the thread that links the disparate time-frames of Da 5 Bloods, bringing past and present together. If only the rest of the movie was equally harmonious. Da 5 Bloods is on Netflix"
The King of Staten Island review – Apatow trades gags for hard truths,"Drawing on his own experiences of childhood bereavement, co-writer Pete Davidson carries this soulful New York story",4,"The career of Judd Apatow is a machine that processes the raw material of traumatic life crises – accidental pregnancy, terminal disease, marital breakdown – and retools it into his particular brand of mortifying, unforgiving comic candour, in films such as Knocked Up, Funny People and This Is 40. His latest picture – about childhood bereavement and its lingering aftermath – fits right alongside his preferred themes, but though spiked with dry humour its tone is more pensive and heartfelt, the glib gags traded for harder truths.This more soulful approach stems from the involvement of Saturday Night Live’s Pete Davidson, who stars in the film and co-wrote it, inking in details from his own life: like the central character, Davidson lost his firefighter father to an accident on the job when he was a child. Davidson plays Scott, a twentysomething screw-up who medicates his grief with weed, and maps out his dead-end life in crummy home-made tattoos. All loose limbs and exposed emotional scar tissue, Davidson is persuasively raw in a performance that becomes increasingly textured and interesting as Scott finds a father figure in his mother’s ex-boyfriend. It’s his bruised charisma that compensates for a certain spaced-out lethargy in the storytelling and an overlong running time.The King of Staten Island is available on all major platforms"
A Rainy Day in New York review – misogyny bathed in nostalgia,Woody Allen’s romantic comedy starring Elle Fanning is the work of a director who has lost touch with reality,2,"In Woody Allen’s latest offering, Gen Z heart-throb Timothée Chalamet plays a character named Gatsby Welles. This is only the film’s first red flag. Though A Rainy Day in New York is set in present-day Manhattan, college student Welles is not a modern man. He loves “a cocktail lounge piano” and prefers vintage cigarette holders to the vape pens held by his peers. Ever the gentleman, he volunteers as tour guide to his prim pageant queen girlfriend Ashleigh (Elle Fanning), who is in town to interview middle-aged film director Roland Pollard (Liev Schreiber) for their school paper. She ditches Gatsby for a more mature set of chaperones, including a screenwriter (Jude Law) and a Hollywood actor (Diego Luna), who she charms with her naivety and adorable tics, such as a tendency to hiccup when “sexually conflicted”. Cut to a leering “comedy” set piece as Fanning is locked out of Luna’s apartment in her bra and pants. Characters and storylines appear to have been chosen at random by a Woody Allen meme generator. The film’s B-plot involves Chalamet avoiding his mother, and reconnecting with an ex’s sparky younger sister (Selena Gomez). Gomez’s smoky, sardonic delivery is wonderful. The same cannot be said for Chalamet, who spends the film shrugging his shoulders, his head shrinking into his neck like an affected, embarrassed turtle.In light of Allen’s remarks about the #MeToo movement (and, presumably, historical abuse allegations surrounding the film-maker), distributor Amazon Studios returned the film, cancelling its US release. Cast members Chalamet, Gomez and Rebecca Hall also disowned it, donating their salaries to charity. Cinematographer Vittorio Storaro bathes the film in flattering golden light, perhaps in the hope that it might disguise or at least soften the misogyny on screen. This nostalgic aesthetic only makes the film more anachronistic, not exactly making the case for its creator as an artist in touch with contemporary reality."
Streaming: the best Hollywood golden age classics now on iPlayer,"The BBC has snapped up 23 gems from the RKO vaults, from Fred and Ginger to salty romcoms and rousing westerns",0,"Many a friend and family member has told me they’re watching more classic cinema than usual in lockdown, and not just because they’ve binged every bit of new content Netflix has to offer. Nostalgia, however rosy and selective, is all the more inviting when present-day reality has so little comfort to offer. In spite of this drawcard, the selection of films made before, say, 1970 on most streaming outlets remains spotty at best.Which is why the BBC iPlayer’s recent acquisition of 23 films from the vault of RKO Pictures – one of Hollywood’s “Big Five” studios in the golden age, bankrupted by the 1960s – has been received with palpable excitement. Suddenly I find enthusiastic responses to the likes of The Magnificent Ambersons and King Kong popping up all over my Twitter feed: it certainly makes a nice change from the Tiger King discourse of the spring.All the films are available to stream for over a year, and range from classics – hey, have you heard that Citizen Kane is supposed to be pretty good? – to lesser-known treasures, or ones that have just gradually lost their following over the years. None are duds: you can safely pick any one at random and sink pleasurably into its combination of plush studio artifice, tidy traditional storytelling and blazing star quality: this is, after all, the terrain of Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant, Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire.The latter two are particularly well represented: in the age of Strictly Come Dancing, after all, a bit of ballroom spectacle never goes out of style. Top Hat is the most famous of the genre, and with good reason. I couldn’t remember its trifle of a romantic plot if my life depended on it, but the duo’s dancing was never better or more dreamily clothed and staged: the number that gave the world Cheek to Cheek, complete with Rogers’s famous ostrich-feather gown, is Hollywood dessert of the highest order. Still, the others all have equivalent delights: The Gay Divorcee – she’s happy, of course, not homosexual – loses some points for stripping most of the Cole Porter songs from the stage show it’s based on, but you can’t resist its sheer swirliness.For the sake of comparison, a few of Astaire and Rogers’s respective solo vehicles are also on offer. She fares better on her own than he does: she won an Oscar for ditching the dancing shoes as a class-climbing shop worker in Kitty Foyle, a role rejected by Hepburn, and it’s surprising how elegantly she takes to full-bore melodrama. Dramatically, Astaire feels less at home in the wartime romance The Sky’s the Limit, but it does give him his best screen singing moment with the future Sinatra standard One for My Baby.Those with more macho genre inclinations are covered too: a couple of John Ford westerns are included, the best of them being the rousing, subtly melancholic US Cavalry saga She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, anchored by John Wayne and shot in radiant, justly Oscar-winning Technicolor. Film noir fans can wallow in the chic menace of Angel Face, in which a standard potboiler plot is elevated by the atmospheric psychosexual implications of Otto Preminger’s direction and the bristling chemistry of Robert Mitchum and Jean Simmons: they work so well together they were subsequently paired, to enjoyable if less memorable effect, in the romantic comedy Beautiful But Dangerous, also in the iPlayer lineup.Romcoms, continuing our thematic kick from some weeks ago, are perhaps where the RKO selection delivers most joyously. If you haven’t seen Bringing Up Baby, now’s the time to relish its perfectly choreographed slapstick and lickety-split Grant-Hepburn banter. Grant gets a couple of other outings: My Favourite Wife is less celebrated, but its screwball mechanics are supremely well oiled, and his interplay with Irene Dunne has its own tangy flavour. Director Leo McCarey and Dunne previously teamed up on Love Affair, a delicious blend of champagne-fizzy cruise-ship comedy and romantic angst. Its remake, An Affair to Remember, became better known, but the original is drier, funnier and tinged with sadness: optimum comfort viewing, then, for the strange mood swings of the present.The Lighthouse (Universal, 15) If you fear you’ve gone a bit loopy in lockdown, you’ve got nothing on Robert Pattinson’s lighthouse keeper in Robert Eggers’s astonishing metaphysical horror film: tracking his splintering psyche as he isolates with a splendidly salty Willem Dafoe, it’s a work of unhinged beauty.Echo in the Canyon (Universal, 12) The Laurel Canyon music scene of the 1960s — encompassing such groups as the Byrds and the Beach Boys — gets a loving overview in former record label boss Andrew Slater’s informed, entertaining documentary, packed with excellent music and insights from artists old and new.Vivarium (Vertigo, 15) Clearly it’s the week for extreme social-isolation nightmares in home entertainment. Lorcan Finnegan’s witty, chilly study of two young househunters losing all sense of space, time and sanity in an infinite new-build housing estate makes you grateful for your own home comforts.The Vanishing (StudioCanal, 15) Has there ever been a more purely, efficiently unnerving horror film than this? Probing into all one’s basest fears regarding existence, disappearance and death, George Sluizer’s original 1988 psychodrama gets a handsome Blu-ray reissue."
Echo in the Canyon review – hopelessly lazy LA rock doc,"Brian Wilson, Beck and Eric Clapton are among the star contributors, but the story of Laurel Canyon’s folk-rock scene remains a mystery – and where’s Joni?",2,"This documentary about the folk-rock scene in mid-60s Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles, centres on an all-star tribute show, and would have made a neat free gift for ticket-holders. But with an arrogance unique to those insulated by fame and money, it gets put into the wider marketplace for music documentaries and comes up embarrassingly short.It is the first film by Andrew Slater, who had a varied music career, including journalism, artist management and production, before becoming chief exec of Capitol Records. In 2007, he was ousted just months into a five-year contract with a $15m payout, and Echo in the Canyon feels like a twilight-years project for someone who already gets his DIY and gardening done for him.Slater amasses a really impressive array of talking heads to reminisce about this sunlit corner of American song: Eric Clapton, Brian Wilson, David Crosby, Jackson Browne, the late Tom Petty and more. Beck, Cat Power and Regina Spektor gather in a modernist mansion to discuss the music’s impact; Jakob Dylan, Bob’s son, does the interviews and is a frontman of sorts.The film would have benefited from a structuring voiceover by him, because after a good opening – the Byrds’ Roger McGuinn explaining why he and his peers deserted New York’s folk snobs for pastures new in the west – quickly loses any narrative arc and becomes a soup of celebrity reminiscences.Admittedly, some of these are good value. It’s nice to see Wilson on such bright, perky form, rhapsodising about the Beatles’ Rubber Soul, and contrasting amusingly with Browne’s assessment of Wilson and his fellow Beach Boys: “Five guys wearing the same shirt holding one surfboard: I thought it was lame.” The engaging Stephen Stills has a puckish mien throughout, edged with bitterness when talking about Buffalo Springfield’s Expecting to Fly and bandmate Neil Young: “That song was a warning: I’m leaving. And I’m going to wait until it’s absolutely critically important to the survival of the band.” Michelle Phillips of the Mamas and the Papas vividly describes her infidelities, including one with bandmate Denny Doherty despite being married to her other bandmate, John Phillips: “I was a very busy girl,” she wickedly twinkles.Slater avoids spending any more of his fortune on soundtrack rights by having Jakob et al perform the era’s songs themselves at that tribute show. It is a little self-indulgent to dwell on them for so long, and the arrangements are conservative, but the Mamas and the Papas’ Go Where You Wanna Go is spirited, and Fiona Apple inevitably adds character to It Won’t Be Wrong and In My Room.The overall storytelling, though, is close to hopeless. It takes an hour before Laurel Canyon is really mentioned, and there is no deep inquiry into why so much creative energy rolled through it. You can’t even properly work out where it is, unless you know LA. Between the fun bits of gossip, there are boring details of audio engineering, and the stars are allowed to deliver lots of facile observations (Pet Sounds is good; musicians influence each other) and cliches: Graham Nash hammers the doors of perception closed with the revelation that music can change the world. Even the drug stories are pedestrian, and the film has the dismaying effect of making these musicians seem dull and mortal.Its worst sin, though, is that there is no mention of the most Laurel Canyon-y musician of all: Joni Mitchell, whose Ladies of the Canyon is such an evocative document of life there. Nor any mention of Love, the Eagles, Jim Morrison or James Taylor; Carole King gets a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it nod. And yet the Beatles, a band whose quality and influence have hardly gone unnoticed but who didn’t live there, get swathes of airtime, perhaps because of access to Ringo Starr, who offers little insight.Slater didn’t need to get every last Canyon musician on camera, but to avoid mentioning many of them altogether is a total dereliction of duty. Mojo and Uncut magazines do this sort of nostalgic rock history with so much more specificity and impact – spend your money on some real storytellers. Echo in the Canyon is available on digital platforms from 8 June."
Artificial Things review – Sophie Fiennes directs slow journey towards joy,Available onlineStopgap Dance Company’s disabled and non-disabled dancers create a mood of quiet suspension in an abandoned shopping centre,3,"In an empty shopping centre, against a backdrop of broken ceiling tiles, painted-out windows, shabby fittings and “Please pay here” signs, film-maker Sophie Fiennes gives us a drained palette of beige, grey and porridge white, peeling at the edges. It all lends an abandoned air to Stopgap Dance Company’s Artificial Things.Founded 23 years ago, Stopgap is an inclusive company bringing together disabled and non-disabled dancers. The result being dance that expands on the different ways bodies, and people, relate to one another. This film, made in 2018, is a half-hour reimagining of a 90-minute stage work, in which Fiennes has changed the setting and reordered the scenes of choreographer Lucy Bennett’s original to make, essentially, a new piece. The more fully realised stage version was about a group of people living in suffocating closeness; here the dramaturgy is watered down like the colour palette, but it does create a subtle mood of slow, quiet suspension, even if there’s not much meat on its bones.There’s a strong early solo from dancer Chris Pavia, which, thanks to the shopfloor setting and Pavia’s beige suit, suggests an officious middle manager; it is full of stilted frustrations and petty victories. Witnessing Pavia’s outbursts is the unruffleable David Toole, master of the world-weary raised eyebrow, who moves into a sweet duet with Laura Jones and a wheelchair. There are hints of exceedingly slowed down swing dance from Amy Butler and David Willdridge, as they take turns to lift each other’s weight while always looking past each other with fearful faces. And from a quartet of carefully entwined bodies comes a single, quietly climactic moment, as Willdridge uses his feet to lift Toole (who has no legs) high up into the air: the pose triumphant, the reactions stubbornly neutral.It ends on a hopeful note as the unease is finally vanquished in a joyful finale and the dancers burst out of their malaise. Until then, this is a curiously muted film but it asks for close attention – the expression playing on Jones’s face always suggests there’s much more going on than simply the (in)action of the choreography. Artificial Things is available until 1 September."
Mike Wallace Is Here review – rose-tinted chronicle of a journalistic giant,The tough-talking newsman is the subject of an absorbing doc that relives thrilling highs but overlooks the murkier moments,3,"Mike Wallace was the TV news reporter who became a household name in the US in the 60s as a correspondent with the CBS 60 Minutes programme, pioneering the tough on-camera interview. This documentary is an interesting if shapeless study of him, composed entirely of archive clips, which means his private life is opaque and also that Wallace’s off-camera ethnic slurs and questionable behaviour towards female colleagues go unmentioned.We see him interviewing people – including a young Donald Trump – and being interviewed, often by journalists self-consciously trying to turn the tables on Wallace and give him a diluted taste of his own medicine, the most vehement being Fox’s Bill O’Reilly. Fascinatingly, Wallace began as a jack-of-all-trades announcer, acting in radio drama serials, reading out sponsor messages and hosting gameshows; he was in some ways a rather Reaganesque figure in that he transplanted his performing style into the job he eventually got. If he’d gone into acting, I can imagine Wallace, like Leslie Nielsen, using his deadpan skills for comedy.As a newsman Wallace scored some sensational scoops, the most extraordinary being his interview with Iran’s Ayatollah Khomeini in 1979 (a nail-biting sequence) in which he got Khomeini to attack Egypt’s Anwar Sadat in such a contemptuous way that it could only be interpreted as a call for Sadat to be overthrown and assassinated – which Sadat duly was. But Wallace clearly found a lawsuit launched at him and CBS by General William Westmoreland a very bruising experience, despite finally winning on points. He was probably hurt at the insinuation that he was only reading out questions scripted for him by the producer – like a hack actor. It was a factor in Wallace and CBS caving under pressure from big tobacco during a later anti-cigarette investigation (the film oddly does not mention Michael Mann’s 1999 movie version of this, The Insider, with Christopher Plummer as Wallace).This film does not offer any actual conclusions, but it is an atmospheric immersion in the old, smoky and very male world of American TV journalism.Mike Wallace Is Here is on digital platforms from 29 May."
The High Note review – a romantic comedy without romance or comedy,Young love has never seemed more lifeless than it does as this dreary drama lurches towards its nauseating finale,1,"There are some comedies that seem to have been rubbed all over with an anti-funny, anti-romance Kryptonite. This is one. It’s the cinematic equivalent of elevator muzak – a festival of glam-smug with zero chemistry between any of its three leads. It’s supposedly a comedy-drama, set in the LA music scene: Tracee Ellis Ross plays Grace Davis, a singing legend in middle age who is faced with the career death of a proposed Vegas residency, being forced on her by a cynical, money-mad manager (Ice Cube). Dakota Johnson plays her demure assistant Maggie, a music superfan and vinyl connoisseur (cue: namedropping references to Joni Mitchell) and also a wannabe producer, who tries persuading Grace to record more new songs and stay true to her creativity.Maggie also finds herself romantically drawn to a cocky but talented young singer called David (Kelvin Harrison Jr). The relationships – between the women and the two young lovers – are completely without life, and the whole film is bathed in Insta-video blandness. The magic ingredients in pictures like The Devil Wears Prada and A Star is Born are stubbornly absent; it is steadfastly humourless and there is no sense of what’s really at stake in hitting the big time. Dakota Johnson’s performance remains waxily unenthused as she goes through the motions of break-up/make-up with her mentor and her lover, and just when the film is coasting to its unearned emotional resolution, the script gives us an outrageously silly twist, which brings in a truly ghastly celebration of entitlement and unintentional ickiness. It’s sad to see Harrison, who has shown himself a force to be reckoned with in earlier movies, get landed with this dull schlock.The High Note is available on digital platforms from 29 May."
The Uncertain Kingdom review – short film anthology takes Britain's pulse,Tumbleweed blows on the Irish border and the grim reaper is out of work in these small-scale studies of the state of the UK,4,"The Uncertain Kingdom is a short film collection commissioned in 2019 by producers John Jencks, Georgia Goggin and Isabel Freer as a satirical counterattack to the government’s bizarrely complacent “festival of Brexit” that is still theoretically scheduled to take place in 2022. This is a state-of-the-nation anthology: variously angry, comic and surreal – but weirdly not topical or contemporary in the way it was intended to be, as Covid-19 has now hijacked our every waking thought. (For example, it’s notable that there isn’t a single film here about the NHS.)Some of the films feel redundant or over-literal but the tone of the collection is set by its more successful pieces. The most purely cinematic and ambitious film for me is Antonia Campbell-Hughes’s Acre Fall Between, a disquietingly hallucinatory, dreamlike event taking place on the deserted Irish border. Lanre Malaolu’s The Conversation is challenging and envelope-pushing, a dance piece investigating the feelings of people of colour about dating white people. Among the documentaries, Ellen Evans’s Motherland is a powerful study of the Windrush scandal and the people deported to Jamaica. Carol Salter’s Left Coast is a shrewdly observed and compassionate study of a Blackpool food bank.Many of the comedies took on a single, absurdist high concept and played out its life-cycle within a 10-minute-span. The best of these was Jason Wingard’s Pavement, with Steve Evets as a homeless man literally sinking into the pavement outside a bank’s corporate headquarters: a Beckettian idea that climaxes with a rather moving rendition of Jerusalem. Comedy veteran Guy Jenkin gave us Death Meets Lisolette, with Hugh Dennis drolly playing an Angel of Death who has been locked in a shed, which means people can’t die even if they want to.One piece here could be expanded. David Proud’s witty, mordant Verisimilitude is about a wheelchair user with spina bifida (played by Ruth Madeley), who has acting ambitions but must pay the bills by working as an on-set coach to a fantastically annoying and conceited non-disabled actor Josh (Laurie Davidson), showing him how to play a disabled person. This could well be developed to a full-length film, although Proud might have to resist pressure to make something too cutesy out of it.The Uncertain Kingdom is on digital platforms from 1 June."
Only the Animals review – audacious web of love and strangeness,Dominik Moll’s thriller charts an unhappily married woman’s terrifying fate and her mysterious connections to five other people,4,"Twenty years ago, director Dominik Moll made a splash at Cannes with his black-comic psychological shocker Harry, Un Ami Qui Vous Veut Du Bien, starring the incomparably disturbing Sergi López – a film with the kind of delicious cruelty and sophistication that somehow only the French can produce. Its title over here was inelegantly rendered as Harry, He’s Here to Help, although I made a doomed attempt to popularise my own version: Harry Wants to Be Your Friend. After that, Moll had a number of credits, but nothing to live up to that picture, which promised us a film-maker with the style of Claude Chabrol.But now Moll has given us this audacious, witty and absorbing mystery thriller, a tale of adultery and amour fou with a gamey touch of the macabre – adapted by Moll and his longtime collaborator Gilles Marchand from the novel Seules Les Bêtes by Colin Niel. It is about five people and their relationship with a sixth person who is to meet a terrifying, arbitrary fate. The movie introduces us in turn to these six overlapping lives, with ingenious point-of-view shifts that will explain an apparent oddity or anomaly in the previous scene and set us up for a rug-pull in the next, letting us in on a secret, then coolly pushing us away.The unhappy woman at the centre of this spider’s web is the wealthy and married Evelyne Ducat, whose business takes her to Sète in the south of France but whose lifestyle leaves her emotionally unsatisfied. She is played by Valeria Bruni Tedeschi, and she has a great moment that requires her to give a feline smile of panicky, thin-lipped irritation at a lover, before unleashing the vengeful, petulant slap that is to seal her fate.Near where Evelyne lives is a farm run by the morose Michel, terrifically played by veteran French character actor Denis Ménochet, a man radiating unhappiness, made grizzled and careworn by hard work, and the strain of keeping secrets. His wife, Alice, played with poignant emotional hurt by Laure Calamy (known for the Netflix TV comedy Call My Agent), is acquainted with nearby farmer Joseph (Damien Bonnard), a reclusive, difficult man, going through an emotional breakdown following the death of his adored mother. Then there is the beautiful, willowy Marion, played by Nadia Tereszkiewicz, who waits tables in Sète.Most mysteriously of all there is Armand, a young guy in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, whom we see at the very beginning, cycling somewhere with a goat on his back – a sacrificial goat, perhaps? He is on his way to a local gang boss, Papa Sanou (Christian Ezan), who exerts a voodoo-ish influence and sums up the film’s philosophy by telling Armand: “Chance is stronger than you, idiot!” Poor Armand yearns to be rich and is still in love with a young woman who is the mother of his child but is now with a wealthy European. Armand talks about a “colonial debt”.These people provide the film’s constituent parts, which interlock like the workings of an intricate and malign musical box, creating dashes of melodrama, erotic obsession and even soap opera, and all superbly performed. In a way, each of these people occupies a short story, an individual mini-film, but they all find themselves in the Venn-diagram overlap of fate, and their lives are made to dovetail like the films of Kieslowski’s Three Colours sequence of 1993-94, or Lucas Belvaux’s Trilogie of 2002.The words … Are Happy could go on the end of this film’s title. It is about human beings who are yearning desperately for something they don’t or can’t have – and are bashing at the prison bars of their own loneliness. The gnomic Papa Sanou says something else to the point: “Love is giving what you don’t have.” For many of these people love is about making demands, about trying to get the best of the bargain, or about trying to escape from a terrible bargain about their life’s direction that they don’t remember taking. They want to take love and have nothing to give in return. Only the Animals is on Curzon Home Cinema from 29 May."
The Australian book you've finally got time for: On the Beach by Nevil Shute,"As part of the Unmissables series, writers are recommending a book for your lockdown. For Mammoth author Chris Flynn, Shute’s apocalypse novel is a dynamite isolation read",0," Read more about the UnmissablesI often wonder how many people bought On the Beach when it came out in 1957, assuming it was a novel about a group of gorgeous, sun-kissed surfers catching breaks all summer long. On the Beach is instead about a bunch of miserable Melburnians waiting to die slowly and horribly from radiation poisoning after the world has been annihilated in a nuclear holocaust started by the Albanians.Nevil Shute Norway (he dropped Norway when writing) must have been fond of the beach, because he invented a beach-based weapon of mass destruction called the Panjandrum. Figuring it might be a tad suicidal to launch a frontal assault on the Nazi machine gun nests in Normandy, the British called upon Sub-Lieutenant Norway to come up with a device capable of breaching defences while everyone sheltered in the landing craft. The Panjandrum was two giant wheels connected by a drum, powered by rockets and loaded up with explosives. The idea was you rolled it out of the boat, lit the fuse and stood well back, whereupon it would spin up the beachhead like an out-of-control Burning Man installation and blow the Nazis to smithereens.It didn’t work. In testing, the Panjandrum ran amok, haring off along the beach at 100km/h, launching missiles in every conceivable direction. It almost wiped out the entire Allied high command, who were observing from a very unsafe distance. It later appeared on Dad’s Army.Disenchanted with Britain, Shute moved to Australia in 1950 and wrote one book a year until his death in 1960. First out of the gate was A Town Like Alice, which saw him quickly accepted as a major Australian writer.On the Beach sold millions of copies upon release and was hailed as the most important Australian book ever written. A movie was immediately rushed into production, starring Gregory Peck, Ava Gardner, Fred Astaire and Anthony Perkins, directed by Stanley Kramer. It came out in 1959, only two years after the novel.Despite hewing fairly closely to the book, even going so far as to shoot scenes in Frankston, Berwick, Melbourne CBD and on Phillip Island, the movie was not a success. An apocryphal quote was famously (and erroneously) attributed to Ava Gardner, in which she described Melbourne as “the perfect place to make a film about the end of the world”. The quote was fabricated by Sydney Morning Herald journalist Neil Jillett for a satirical piece and endures in Victorian folklore to this day.As a microcosm of 1950s Australian paranoia and inadequacy, On the Beach is a dynamite isolation read. Despite lending moral support to the United States during the brief war, Australia’s cities didn’t even merit a couple of nukes. Instead, invisible death in the form of fallout is slowly creeping south. Cairns, Brisbane and Sydney succumb, their voices falling silent. Melbourne is hailed as the last outpost of humanity, a major diss to Hobart.For a while, Melbourne embraces its status as party capital of the world. Shute has characters dance the night away, drinking brandy and running riot on Swanston Street. In restriction-era Australia, this alone makes the novel a hedonistic delight, but the main point of excitement is generated by the arrival of an American nuclear submarine, commanded by handsome, veritable “sad Keanu” Dwight Towers. Unfortunate survivors of the apocalypse, the crew mope around port, a boat without a fleet.Dwight falls for feisty local Moira Davidson, even though he has a wife and kid back home (he knows they’re probably dead) but their end-times relationship is curtailed by a mission from the prime minister. A nonsensical morse code signal has been picked up emanating from Seattle and the USS Scorpion is being sent to investigate if radiation levels have fallen. Royal Australian Navy officer Peter Holmes accompanies the Americans, leaving his wife and baby daughter behind in Frankston (an unnecessary cruelty). Civilian Julian Osborne (a cynical, ferocious performance by Fred Astaire in the film) joins the expedition as science officer.No prizes for guessing that the journey is in vain. By the time the submarine returns, radiation is almost upon the city. Chemist Warehouse doles out suicide pills, forcing those with pets and children into a nightmarish scenario. It’s looking bleak for our heroes, but things pick up when Osborne, determined to check out in a blaze of glory, buys a Ferrari for a hundred quid and enters it into the last ever Grand Prix, which is open to anyone.Some 280 drivers turn up and the book suddenly becomes the Fast and Furious franchise entry of our dreams. Every amateur street racer in Melbourne gives it a go, tricked-out sedans lining up next to Maseratis. No one cares if they get killed and pretty much everyone dies in a ball of flame as they spin off the course.A more poignant, romantic fate awaits Osborne, as it does star-crossed lovers Dwight and Moira. Still, On the Beach offers a hellish vision of an alternative Melbourne, one where every citizen eventually finds themselves staring at a handful of cyanide pills. The closing scenes of the movie were shot early on a Sunday morning in the city. The streets are empty. Newspapers tumble in the wind. It’s game over.

Edge of Extinction review – a gruelling fight to survive … and stay awake,Some well-crafted action scenes are thwarted by a stilted script in Andrew Gilbert’s plodding post-apocalyptic thriller ,2,"This postapocalyptic survivalist thriller, set in rural Britain, is both violent and depressing, with some iffy line-readings, weird script moments and untied plot strands. It isn’t badly shot by any means, with one or two effective action scenes and interesting use of remote locations, but it takes two ploddingly long hours to tell a cumbersomely inflated and often dull story, which even at the finish line has to be wound up pretty arbitrarily.We are in a lawless, chaotic land where food, water and shelter are grimly scarce. A lone individual (Luke Hobson), haunted by his tragic past, makes common cause with a young woman (Georgie Smibert) and a desperate, angry man (Chris Kaye) to win out against a terrifying band of marauding cannibals and rapists, led by a brutal figure known as The Beast (Bryn Hodgen). They also get help from a couple, played by Nicholas Chambers and Susan Lee Burton, who have their own reasons for fearing and hating these evil monsters.The strangest moment comes when when Smibert’s character is briefly imprisoned as a sex slave by the Beast, and she briefly befriends another young woman chained up for the same purpose. Later, the couple reveal their daughter was taken and could still be in the Beast’s compound. Did these two plot points have a relationship in earlier script drafts? The way they played out here is disconcerting and inconclusive.The story is, of course, headed for a monumentally horrible, medieval-style bloodbath, and the film delivers on that score, but the dialogue scenes are leaden and it is impossible to feel any sympathy or interest in any of its characters.Edge of Extinction is available on digital platforms."
The Lovebirds review – wacky Netflix murder-mystery romance,Issa Rae and Kumail Nanjiani play a couple forced to run for their lives in Michael Showalter’s likably lewd screwball crime caper,3,"Creating unforgettable cinema isn’t easy, but neither is creating forgettable cinema: goofy, likable comedy of the sort that slides through your mind, leaving behind that most easily patronised of movie effects – a good feeling. The Lovebirds, by screenwriter Aaron Abrams and director Michael Showalter, is like this, a wacky romcom romp (rompcom?) showcasing a bizarre, spoofy twist on Kubrick’s Eyes Wide Shut. It’s something you might watch on a plane. Right now, that’s no putdown: an unappreciated comfort from happier times.Kumail Nanjiani and Issa Rae play Jibran and Leilani, young professionals in New Orleans who hooked up three years before the action begins, moved in together shortly afterwards and found that their relationship began to deteriorate.Domestic intimacy has made each partner profoundly unimpressed by the other’s professional life. Jibran is a self-described documentary film-maker who is reluctant to show his great work to anyone and will reveal only that it is about financial irregularity in the world of education, a subject that stuns Leilani with pure boredom and irritation. As for Leilani, she works in an ad agency and owes her career to a commercial for body wash, based on her own experience in college of experimentally having sex with an unattractive man due to his pleasant skin aroma.Driving one evening to a dinner party, they have another argument and realise simultaneously their relationship is over. Jibran takes his eyes off the road to gaze sadly into the eyes of his now ex-partner who gazes sadly into his. There is melancholy and even grief in both – and then they crash into a murderous criminal situation involving an occult secret society. Jibran and Leilani must run for their lives, and use their wits to solve a crime that the cops might be about to pin on them. Could it be that this appalling new scenario will reignite their love?From here on, the movie depends on simply getting the couple skittering from one farcical situation to another, to the accompaniment of an ironised bantery-squabbly argument about what they are going to do: the 21st-century equivalent of screwball. They argue about the meaning of “fuckboy”; they argue about the element of spontaneity necessary for an orgy; they argue about whether it is pretentious to call a fire escape a “catwalk”; they argue about the lyrics, “Bad boys, bad boys, whatcha gonna do.”There is a strange moment when they are imprisoned by the bad guys and threatened with a certain type of torture: being kicked by a horse, which has apparently been brought here for the specific purpose of meting out barnyard related violence. Then it is over, and the surreality consists in never giving the horse a backward glance.Nanijani and Rae work well together, although “chemistry” is perhaps a stretch: there was more of a genuine romantic spark between Nanijani and his erstwhile co-star Zoe Kazan in his 2017 film The Big Sick, which was also directed by Showalter, and that probably had more jeopardy and more about being in love. The Lovebirds is pretty lightweight – which is how it can take off. The Lovebirds is on Netflix from 22 May."
The Final Wish review – curse of the cliche puts paid to haunted-vase tale,Muddled and unimaginative plotting leaves this 90s-style low-budget chiller as a disappointing missed opportunity,2,"The Final Wish could be the last straw. It’s another example of dumb horror: derivative, factory-product, unscary movie-making that jumbles up a bunch of secondhand tropes without any real storytelling discipline, although there is a decent, professional performance here from Lin Shaye as an ageing woman haunted by her past.Aaron (Michael Welch), a young guy whose life is going nowhere and who thinks of himself as a failure, has to return to his home town on hearing that his dad has died. There is an uneasy reunion with his troubled mother, Kate (Shaye), local girl Lisa (Melissa Bolona) with whom he is still poignantly in love, and a number of school friends and school enemies. But his late father, an antiques dealer, had in his possession a mysterious urn that can grant wishes – which leads to horrible Mephistophelean choices for Aaron.I’m a sucker for a Monkey’s Paw-type story, something like the brash Wishmaster films of the 90s. But here, fatally, there is no clarity or internal consistency about how these wishes are to be expressed and granted. Does Aaron literally have to say, or think, some phrase such as “I wish” or “I want”? By the end of the drama, when the number of wishes requested becomes very important, the answer would appear to be yes. But earlier, he could apparently (and accidentally) wish for the death of a dog merely by disliking the animal.Then there is the time-honoured question of wishing for a dead person to be back with us, and all the spine-chilling implications. Are these reanimated corpses the actual people, or just an evil genie impersonating them? Again, there is something very feeble in the answer to this.A low-budget scarer like this could have worked. The script lets it down.The Final Wish is available on digital platforms from 25 May."
The Wretched review – grisly holiday horror,"A groovily attired witch terrorises a seaside town in this grisly, teen-leaning chiller from the directors of Deadheads",3,"In a parallel universe, this lean, surprisingly grisly horror from brothers Brett and Drew Pierce (Deadheads) might have been a teen movie. Set during the summer holidays in an east coast seaside town, there’s a poolside humiliation, an almost-kiss at a drunken house party, and a wholesome flirtation revolving around strawberry-flavoured Starbursts. It’s even more of a jolt, then, when an evil witch assumes the body of a local woman (Zarah Mahler) and begins stealthily terrorising 17-year-old Ben’s (John-Paul Howard) sleepy neighbourhood. She makes flowers wilt, seduces fathers and abducts and eats their children, all the while modelling an impressive collection of dramatic, floor-length dresses.Ben turns to a website called “Witchopedia” to figure out how best to vanquish her. The film isn’t the smartest or most sophisticated example of the genre, but it’s not trying to be. There’s something appealing about its modest ambitions, with its cast of unknowns, relative low stakes and retro jump scares."
The Whistlers review – a glorious romp,This Romanian comedy-drama about a dirty cop doffs its cap to classic Hollywood,4,"Romanian film-maker Corneliu Porumboiu dispenses with the miserabilism associated with his country’s cinema in this tart romp about a tangle of double crossings. Cristi (Vlad Ivanov) is a dirty cop from Bucharest embroiled in a money-laundering scam in La Gomera (“the pearl of the Canary Islands”, a tannoy announces). “Forget what happened in Bucharest,” purrs Gilda (Catrinel Marlon), greeting him on arrival. “It was just for the security cameras.” A flashback showing the act she’s referring to is hardly a clarification. A cigarette dangling from her lips, she’s a classic femme fatale. She both assists and distracts.But Cristi too is being monitored; to avoid detection from his boss, Magda (Rodica Lazar), he must learn “Silbo Gomero”, a whistling language peculiar to the Canaries. Scenes of his lessons prove that he’s not exactly a natural, and are a showcase for writer-director Porumboiu’s acidic sense of humour. From Tudor Mircea’s citrus-bright cinematography to the judicious use of Iggy Pop’s sunshiney 1977 track The Passenger, everything about this comedy-drama pops and snaps. Also zesty are Porumboiu’s nods to classic Hollywood, via references to Alfred Hitchcock, John Ford and even Charles Victor (I should think it’s no coincidence this film’s lady in red shares her namesake with the title of his 1946 noir)."
Apropos of Nothing review – Woody Allen's times and misdemeanours,"Dropped by the original publisher after a staff protest, the film-maker’s autobiography can be brutally honest but also a bore, and neither he nor Mia Farrow come out of it well",0,"Though I see what he was getting at, I don’t quite agree with Hilaire Belloc, who once wrote that just as omelettes are either admirable or intolerable, and nothing in between, so it is with autobiography. Most memoirs, alas, struggle over the same things: fame, for instance, is often less interesting (or perhaps simply harder to describe) than the struggle to achieve it; the central irony of autobiography is that it’s far easier to be truthful about other people than it is to be honest about oneself. Such books tend, then, to be patchy: utterly delicious at times, but at other moments, stodgy and in need of seasoning.If Woody Allen’s Apropos of Nothing was an omelette, you’d scoff down two-thirds of it pretty smartish, I think, after which – sated, to a degree – you’d mournfully scrape what remained on your plate into the bin. Later, you might be troubled by a hint of indigestion; even a little light queasiness. But in the morning, contemplating the Alka-Seltzer, I’m not sure you would be full of regret, let alone inclined to avoid omelettes for life. What I’m trying to say is that Allen’s autobiography is a mixed bag. If he can write (obviously, he can), and if he is, at points, surprisingly honest (eye-poppingly so, on occasion), then he can also be a bore and a self-deceiver. Of course, if you’re one of those who, disgusted by what you regard as his moral failings, has vowed never to watch Annie Hall or Manhattan again, then you’re unlikely to want to embark on Apropos of Nothing in the first place – and fair enough, that’s up to you. But I’m not in that camp. Nor can I comment on Allen’s alleged abuse of his adoptive daughter, Dylan, a crime of which he was first accused in 1992 (two police investigations into this have come to nothing). What I will say, however, is that I regard it as both disgraceful and alarming that Hachette, his original publisher, gutlessly dropped his book following a walkout by some of its staff – and that though I was sometimes repulsed by it myself, I was also fascinated, even entertained. So, shoot me. Again, that’s your choice.Like Salinger’s Holden Caulfield, Allen “doesn’t feel like going into all that David Copperfield kind of crap”. But even so, he’s good on his Brooklyn childhood: smart and beady and occasionally funny. His parents – his father was a bookmaker; his mother worked in a florist – were, he tells us, as “mismatched as Hannah Arendt and Nathan Detroit”, disagreeing on everything save for “Hitler and my report cards”. As a boy, he loved magic, fell hard for jazz, courtesy of the great Sidney Bechet, and found his most adored pal in the form of his cousin, Rita. Most readers will know already about the early career: the gags written for the tabloids, the work for radio and as a standup. What surprises in this account is the relative ease with which he became a writer and director (Take the Money and Run, in 1969, was the first proper film). He presents it here so casually: the equivalent of moving from, say, working in a bank to working in an estate agent’s office.He’s straightforward about his movies. He knows, mostly, which of them work and which don’t (or maybe it’s just that he agrees with me) – and he can be acute when it comes to actors, too. Plenty has been made already of his remarks about, among others, Scarlett Johansson (“when you meet her, you have to fight your way through the pheromones”), and I’m not about to defend him on this score. Yuck. The book is dedicated to Soon-Yi, the de facto stepdaughter he seduced when she was 21 and who is now his third wife (she is 35 years his junior): “I had her eating out of my hand and then I noticed my arm was missing,” he writes, a line that could not be more tone deaf if it were Florence Foster Jenkins.But reviewers have also quoted selectively, and while one doesn’t cancel out the other, it’s kind of great how much he admires the talent of, say, Judy Davis, Barbara Hershey and Dianne Wiest – precisely the kind of women Hollywood likes to make invisible. His account of the mental illness suffered by his second wife, Louise Lasser, is unsparing to the point of cruelty. But the warmth he feels for her is obvious; they’ve remained friends. Ditto Diane Keaton, a woman who, as he puts it, dressed “as if her personal shopper was Buñuel” (sidebar: people tend to forget that Keaton was no longer his girlfriend by the time they made Annie Hall).OK… I’m coming to it. Allen devotes around 100 pages – extremely energetic, committed pages: by turns angry and whiny, disingenuous and sometimes just plain baffled – to his relationship with Soon-Yi Previn and its discovery in 1992 by her mother, his then partner, Mia Farrow, courtesy of some “erotic” Polaroids; to the subsequent allegation, made initially by Farrow, that he had abused their adopted daughter, Dylan; and to his later estrangement both from Dylan and his son, Ronan (the latter has always supported his sister; however, their brother, Moses, as Allen notes, has since taken the side of his father). None of this is edifying, to the point where I will avoid repeating the worst of it, British libel laws being somewhat stricter than in the US. However, Allen would have been equally damned had he said nothing at all on this score.No, he doesn’t come out of it well. But nor does Farrow (his twisted partiality is one thing, but facts are another, and it has to be said that it took her an awfully long time – about 40 years – to turn on her friend, Roman Polanski, who in 1978 pleaded guilty to unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor). To return to where we began, here’s another thing about omelettes: you can’t make one without breaking eggs. This is a horrible, painful and, above all, highly opaque story, and it always will be – up to, and including, the day it is inevitably mentioned in the first paragraph of a long newspaper obituary. Apropos of Nothing by Woody Allen is published by Arcade (£24.71). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com or call 020-3176 3837 This article was amended on 13 July 2020 to describe Soon-Yi Previn as having been Woody Allen’s “de facto” stepdaughter; Allen was not married to Previn’s adoptive mother, Mia Farrow."
Never Rarely Sometimes Always review - profoundly moving abortion drama,Eliza Hittman’s coming-of-age story about a US teenager seeking a termination is heartbreaking and painfully authentic,5,"From Eliza Hittman, the remarkable writer-director of It Felt Like Love and Beach Rats, comes another drama that manages to blend the gritty authenticity of a documentary with the poetic sensibility of pure cinema. In her impressively measured and beautifully understated third feature, Hittman tells an oft-hidden story of reproductive rights – an age-old issue that has urgent contemporary relevance. Yet Never Rarely Sometimes Always never feels polemical. On the contrary, it is perhaps best described as a perfectly observed portrait of female friendship; a coming-of-age story with road-movie inflections, piercingly honest and deeply affecting.Feature first-timer (and accomplished musician) Sidney Flanigan is superb as Autumn, a 17-year-old from Pennsylvania who discovers that she cannot get an abortion in her home town without parental consent. Quietly desperate, Autumn reluctantly confides in her more outgoing cousin Skylar (rising star Talia Ryder, soon to be seen in Spielberg’s West Side Story), who agrees to accompany her across state lines to New York. The pair imagine that the trip will be brief but find themselves spending days and nights on the streets, waiting for the procedure that Autumn was denied in Pennsylvania.Inspired by “these untold journeys that women take” (Ann Rossiter’s Ireland’s Hidden Diaspora: The “Abortion Trail” and the Making of a London-Irish Underground, 1980-2000 apparently proved an instructive work), Hittman’s drama may be fictional, but it is firmly rooted in factual research. Like Kitty Green’s current release The Assistant, everything about Never Rarely Sometimes Always has a matter-of-fact veracity: from heartbreaking early scenes in which we see Autumn helplessly punching her own bruised stomach to her very different experiences at a pregnancy centre in Pennsylvania and a Planned Parenthood clinic in Brooklyn.Indeed, in the pivotal scene from which the film takes its title, it is not an actor but a real counsellor, Kelly Chapman, who asks Autumn about her history, her health, her safety, using a series of set questions to which those multiple choice answers apply. Autumn’s responses, which include significant silences, speak volumes not only about her own experiences but about those of so many women who find themselves in a similar situation.Brief scenes of anti-abortion activists picketing clinics remind us of the crisis facing women’s rights in Trump’s increasingly retrogressive America. Yet, as with her previous features, Hittman’s primary focus is her characters – their lives, their experiences, their dreams and disappointments. Early scenes of Autumn and Skylar in their home town, where both work part-time in the local grocery store, are an object lesson in how to convey vast amounts of information with minimal dialogue; snapshots of an environment that has shaped the lives of these two very different characters.Significant, too, that the only time Autumn really seems to verbalise her feelings is when she plays a solo version of He’s Got the Power at the school talent contest, turning the Exciters’ upbeat 60s hit into a plaintive ballad (“He makes me do things I don’t wanna do”), provoking cries of derision from the audience, followed by an awful moment of emptiness, and then a steely continuation through barely restrained tears.Hittman has described Never Rarely Sometimes Always as “a narrative about a girl carrying around a lot of pain and burden, and the loneliness of it all”. That loneliness is certainly a key part of the film’s emotional palette, captured with great insight and understanding. Yet ultimately it is the growing bond between Autumn and Skylar that sticks in the mind, beautifully expressed in a strange moment of silent hand-holding that quite took my breath away.Plaudits to French cinematographer Hélène Louvart, who did such sensual work on Beach Rats, and who here manages to capture moments of intense intimacy in unobtrusive fashion. In a film in which so much is expressed through minute gestures, Louvart keeps a remarkable balance between the geography of these characters’ faces and that of the ever-changing landscape through which they pass. Through her camera, we become both observers and participants – watching these young women’s lives but also empathetically experiencing their shared journeys.The result is a film that combines the melancholy magic of John Schlesinger’s Midnight Cowboy with the humanist artfulness of the Dardenne brothers’ finest neorealist works. Perfectly pitched and sensitively played, this is truthful, powerful and profoundly moving fare from a film-maker at the very top of her game.Never Rarely Sometimes Always streams on multiple platforms from 13 May"
Dangerous Lies review – diverting yet dopey Netflix thriller,A ridiculously titled film about a couple who stumble upon a stash of money is absurd and cliched but mostly entertaining,3,"One of the most surprising reveals of last October’s unprecedented Netflix data dump was the astounding popularity of cheap psycho-thriller Secret Obsession. While the streamer proudly touted new films from Alfonso Cuarón, Paul Greengrass and the Coens in the same period, it was a no-star, dim-plotted slab of schlock that netted more viewers, with an estimated 40m households eager to find out just how secret that obsession really was. Modelled after a Lifetime TV movie (with a Lifetime TV director at the helm), it was an important victory for Netflix because it revealed a substantial audience for tiny-budgeted thrillers with generic titles, a bracket they could easily fill at little expense.Which brings us to Dangerous Lies, a comically titled new thriller from the director of Fatal Lessons, Dangerous Heart and It’s Christmas, Carol!, a similarly cheap yet not unenjoyable Friday night diversion. Originally called Windfall, the patchwork plot follows a young couple living on the breadline, or what a film such as this thinks is the breadline (their “lousy” apartment is enviably spacious). In the first scene, we see Katie (Riverdale’s Camila Mendes) and Adam (The Boys’ Jessie T Usher) stumbling across an aborted robbery at the diner where she works. Adam shoots and kills the assailant and four months later, they’re dealing with the aftermath. Katie is now working as a carer for Leonard (Elliot Gould), whose loneliness has made her an important part of his life. When he suddenly dies and the couple find a large stash of money in his house, they find themselves telling some … DANGEROUS LIES!If anything, that awful title helps to fill us in on exactly what to expect here, despite how generic it might be. This is the sort of low-rent, trope-filled thriller that used to exist on the bottom shelf of a video store, aiming for undemanding customers whose first, second and third choices were all rented out for the night. Taken as such, it’s perfectly passable, a solidly made time-waster that drip-feeds its reveals with enough skill to keep us onboard, even as we sigh and rage at the characters for acting in increasingly dopey ways. It’s one of those films where smart people do stupid things and the script, from Hallmark channel regular David Golden (whose credits include Finding Father Christmas, Engaging Father Christmas and Marrying Father Christmas), stretches credulity so far that the film frequently threatens to buckle under the weight of its characters’ terrible choices.It’s pacy enough to secure at least our divided attention, competently trotting along in the background revealing surprises that aren’t really that surprising, like a pulpy, well-worn airplane novel that you guiltily devour in a day. You’ll be wrapped up in the moment before poking through its many many holes seconds later. Mendes and Usher make for a charismatic pairing, there’s some silly snarling from The OC’s Cam Gigandet as a mysterious realtor, some concerned lawyering from Gotham’s Jamie Chung and some embittered detecting from Dawson’s Creek’s Sasha Alexander, a low-paid parade of “Oh that one from that thing” actors (strangely the weakest link is a frankly bored Gould, barely phoning it in).The familiarity of the title, the premise and the cast will all help to thrust it to big numbers, I imagine, and I’m sure there are plenty of others like this on the way: clumsily titled, scrappily written and easily consumed. I just wish those lies had been a bit more dangerous …Dangerous Lies is now available on Netflix"
The Assistant review – #MeToo drama offers unsettling study of day-to-day abuse,"Film about assistant to a New York film mogul details how stress, humiliation and bullying become the enablers for abuse by powerful men ",5,"A hundred micro-aggressions add up to one macro horror, a thousand petty humiliations snowball into a big swallowed insult, a million infected paper cuts metastasise into a giant tumour of abuse. This is the situation in Kitty Green’s gripping #MeToo drama-thriller The Assistant, a nightmare of toxic office politics and media misogyny that now reaches streaming platforms after its showing at the Berlin film festival earlier this year. Its chill has deepened in my mind ever since.This is a claustrophobic, intimately unsettling movie about the young female assistant to an arrogant, abusive New York-based film mogul, like the one now doing jail time in Rikers Island. It can claim to be the first drama that addresses the #MeToo issue: set before this behaviour was publicly challenged, part of the film’s point could well be to suggest that the abuse continues right now.It takes place much of the time in an eerie near-wordlessness, with ambient office noises – scanners, printers, coffee-makers – subdued murmurings and overheard snatches of conversation and shouting elsewhere, in the inner sanctums of powerful men’s offices. This is the sound of frightened people keeping their heads down. The one stretch of conventional dialogue is the abrupt and jittery conversation that this assistant has with the hatchet-faced head of human resources, an ass-covering time-server. This nerve-jangling sequence reveals the momentary influence of David Mamet and his Hollywood play Speed the Plow.Julia Garner is excellent as Jane, a young woman who has swallowed and internalised all the stress and humiliation of this job – a supposedly prestigious post that she landed shortly after graduating. She instinctively knows that silence and submission is the way to survive, and is on the way to normalising a corporate self-hate.Jane is subject to numberless micro-mortifications daily: she has to cover up for her boss and at some level understands that a great deal of everyone’s administrative energy is consumed by this same thing. But it does not seem to get her any respect. She does not get to join in with the jokes and frat-boy high-jinks of her two young male colleagues whose only moments of contact with her come when they advise her on the emails of apology that she keeps having to send to her boss on account of being indiscreet about his movements when his wife has called.Jane is worried. She sees beautiful young women signing mysterious legal documents without an agent or lawyer present for no obvious reason – and finds herself having to pick up items of woman’s jewellery and accessories that the boss’s guests appear to have left behind in his office and get them quietly back to their owners. She is disturbed that he has hired a beautiful young woman as his second “assistant” – to whom the film’s title may ambiguously refer – and has put her up in a downtown hotel where he is in the habit of taking “meetings”. Julia is just new enough in the job for this to be shocking to her and to make her feel that she should do something about it. Hence the visit to the HR manager, exquisitely played by Matthew Macfadyen with the same carapace of defensive cynicism and suppressed fear he had in the TV drama Succession.The Assistant is a shrewd and brilliant look at the second tier of Weinsteinesque wrongdoing: the sexual abuse has to be enabled by assistants, who are often women and themselves subject to bullying interspersed by spurious gestures of ersatz charm or assurances that they are themselves being groomed for greatness as independent producers.Jane is being glimpsed at a watershed moment: will she stand up to the abuse and risk career catastrophe, or go along with it? It is a brilliant study of what day-by-day, moment-by-moment abuse looks like. The Assistant is available on digital platforms from 1 May. This article was amended on 30 April 2020 to correct a character’s name."
"DAU. Degeneration review – shocking, six-hour satire of Soviet science","This monumental drama, shot in a replica of Moscow’s real-life Institute of Physical Problems, is an arthouse freakout",4,"Earlier this year at the Berlin film festival, I saw the brutal and bizarre DAU. Natasha. It is one of 14 feature films that have come out of the extraordinary multimedia DAU project devised by Russian film-maker Ilya Khrzhanovsky, who over the past decade has built a detailed full-scale replica of the Moscow building housing the real-life Institute of Physical Problems, an experimental psychology unit presided over in the 60s by the free-thinking Soviet scientist Lev Landau (nicknamed “Dau”), and filled it with actors improvising the imagined lives of its scientist researchers on a 24/7 basis. He recorded the results in films, video art and photo collections.DAU. Natasha, about the unhappy life of the institute’s fictional canteen manager, was shocking enough. Khrzhanovsky takes it to the next level with DAU. Degeneration, the 13th film in the series, co-directed with Ilya Permyakov - a grisly satirical ordeal about Soviet fascist-totalitarianism, taking place in the institute’s gloomy corridors, shabby meeting rooms, sinister experimental labs and occasionally the giant courtyard outside. It’s a monumental arthouse freakout weighing in at a mind-boggling six hours. Even now, I’m still not sure how to take it. Khrzhanovsky may come to be seen as the post-Soviet Alejandro Jodorowsky in his sheer ambition, or something like the Pasolini of Salò, Or the 120 Days of Sodom. And he resembles Charlie Kaufman’s imaginary mad genius Caden Cotard (played by Philip Seymour Hoffman) who attempted a similar folie de grandeur in the film Synecdoche, New York.DAU. Denegeration has the director’s now familiar mannerisms of deadpan extended improv dialogue, combined with a gonzo porn aesthetic, non-professionals being put through the wringer and a certain snuff-horror nausea, featuring a truly upsetting pig-slaughtering scene that is all too real. And the scenes of people being menaced, bullied, shocked – they look very real, too. The people playing the nasty people don’t look they’re pretending to be nasty. It is commonplace to say that some films are scary and mad. But this really is scary and mad.The idea is that Denegeration takes place 10 years on from Natasha. It’s 1968, the time of the Prague spring, when the Soviet leadership is defensive and embattled. The overall chief of the institute, Lev Landau, is ill and all but comatose, following what appears to have been a stroke. (In real life, he was incapacitated following a car crash.) Olga (Olga Shkabarnya) – Natasha’s assistant in the first film – has risen to the status of administrator with a pair of stern glasses, while Azhippo (Vladimir Azhippo), the horrifying state-security interrogator from Natasha, has been given the job of institute director, and instantly makes it his business to clamp down on the louche goings-on: the drinking and the sex.His predecessor was in the habit of harassing and sexually assaulting his secretaries (Azhippo’s disapproval of this is one thing of which we might approve, though this audience response is an outlier) and some younger students are infatuated with dancing to western-style pop records. Azhippo gathers a loyal cadre of the more uptight students around him and tells them to threaten and upset everyone else – which they do, instantly revealing themselves to be fascist thugs: racist, antisemitic and homophobic. And all the time, the strange experiments continue, on chimps, pigs and babies.DAU. Degeneration is at one level a ferocious vision of Soviet communism as one big psychological experiment gone wrong, and this merges with new-style nationalism. It isn’t a stretch to see the hideous Azhippo as a Vladimir Putin-alike. But how is the satire working, exactly? From all the reports, Khrzhanovsky used real-life neo-Nazis to play the thugs, though – and this has to be said – they look ugly and stupid and fatuous.My larger reservation (apart from a general glassy-eyed shock at the proceedings) is that DAU. Degeneration is not in essence telling us anything that wasn’t in DAU. Natasha, and takes three-and-half more hours to do it. But it is difficult to forget the scene where little schoolkids visit the institute to sing a bizarre song in praise of “science”, and then this song is repeated as a grotesque nationalist anthem. There’s something to be said for cinema as a disruptor.

The Family Way review – potent portrait of sex in the swinging 60s,"In this rereleased comic drama, Hayley Mills and Hywel Bennett play a couple plagued by a wedding-night disaster and the neighbours’ wagging tongues",4,"‘It’s life, lad. It might make you laugh at your age, but one day it’ll make you bloody cry.” After 54 years, this British movie from the Boulting brothers flares like a struck match with broad comedy, fierce sentimentality and a strange dark sense of life’s painfulness – and it’s an amazingly vivid time capsule of Britain in the 1960s. The Family Way, rereleased on digital platforms, is based on a stage play by Bill Naughton, itself developed from his Armchair Playhouse TV script, and directed by Roy Boulting and produced by John Boulting, with a musical score from Paul McCartney, arranged by George Martin.Hywel Bennett brings his discontented-cherub presence to the role of Arthur Fitton, a young cinema projectionist in Bolton. (They’re incidentally showing Karel Reisz’s racy Morgan: A Suitable Case for Treatment and also Alfie, starring Michael Caine, based on Naughton’s play.) Arthur is getting married to Jenny Piper, played by Hayley Mills. Jenny is a virgin, as nice girls in those days were supposed to be before their big day, and presumably Arthur is also, although this is never explicitly remarked on in the same way, and – in art as in life – we are perhaps invited to assume that, whatever his later difficulties, the man involved will have discreetly understood the groom’s responsibility for gaining experience before his wedding night. Arthur’s mother and father are played by John Mills (father of Hayley) and Marjorie Rhodes; Jenny’s parents by John Comer and Avril Angers.The wedding and raucous reception go off reasonably enough, although Arthur’s loudmouth dad insists on challenging him to a psychologically fraught arm-wrestling contest. But then – disaster. For an unpleasant prank, one of the boorish guests has sabotaged Arthur and Jenny’s marriage bed in the spare room of his mum and dad’s house (where they’re living for the time being) and, what with the strain of that disaster and the honeymoon getting cancelled because of a crooked travel agent, Arthur develops a nervous problem. He can’t consummate the marriage. The weeks of frustration and unhappiness drag into months, and the local whisperings get louder.Non-sex after marriage could be a parable for the way most people in Britain were actually experiencing the supposedly swinging 60s, and this is a classic drama of the respectable and aspirational working class, with a kitchen-sink realist feel that feels more conspicuous from our 21st-century viewpoint. It resembles Noël Coward’s This Happy Breed as well as Billy Liar and The Likely Lads, with flashes of something like Dennis Potter. It is far more complex than it initially appears, with grumpy, boisterous Mr Fitton haunted by his friendship with his old pal, Billy, creating an emotional triangle to be replicated in the next generation with Arthur’s brother Geoffrey (Murray Head) falling in love with Jenny.Marjorie Rhodes won a Tony for playing the part of Arthur’s mother on Broadway, and she has two extraordinary moments here, so extraordinary I had to stop my DVD and play them again in a state of “Wait! What?” When she’s talking about a passionate moment in her early life, she is suddenly transfigured in closeup with a kind of quiet ecstasy, and the background behind her face bleaches out into a heavenly white, the kind of stylisation that occurs nowhere else in the film. The second moment comes when she objects to her husband vulgarly talking about a “public convenience”. And why? She explains: “When I was a girl, I walked into a men’s place by mistake. What a sight. Two lines of them all wearing raincoats, with their stooped backs and their bloomin’ heads sunk forwards, as though they expected to be shot in the back at any moment. If ever I have a nightmare, you can bet your life that comes into it.” That taboo is well described.John Mills is also very good, although there is something psychologically complicated in the casting, as if he is signalling to the public with his very protective presence that there will be nothing untoward happening to Hayley Mills, so recently the face of Walt Disney’s Pollyanna.Losing your virginity on your wedding night (with everyone gigglingly speculating as to the outcome) is something that feels so ancient, although the whole nation went through it with the wedding of Lady Diana Spencer and Prince Charles in 1981. This film finds the tragicomedy as well as the comedy. It is surprisingly potent. The Family Way is available on digital platforms from 4 May."
The Easy Bit review – how men get to grips with IVF,This well-intentioned documentary about the first step in fertility treatment has moments of humour but is too emotionally hectoring,2,"The Guardian’s product and service reviews are independent and are in no way influenced by any advertiser or commercial initiative. We will earn a commission from the retailer if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more.Tom Webb’s documentary about men’s experiences of fertility treatment is a well-intentioned film on a valid subject – but I found it flawed, over-reliant on six talking heads, almost to the exclusion of any other explanatory style. Webb speaks to six men whose partners are undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF), a notoriously painful, upsetting, intimately invasive procedure.The Guardian’s product and service reviews are independent and are in no way influenced by any advertiser or commercial initiative. We will earn a commission from the retailer if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more.Men often don’t know how to express their feelings, or indeed if they are allowed to have feelings. They do what appears to be “the easy bit” in fertility treatment – supplying the sperm and then waiting while the woman goes through the incomparably more challenging business of IVF and then (they hope) pregnancy and childbirth.Men often don’t want to talk about their own frustration and sorrow at the many setbacks, and not necessarily because they’re emotionally illiterate – they want to be quietly supportive for their partners. Webb’s film is simply dominated by these talking heads, interspersed with educational-video-style talks about what happens.This approach was unvarying and emotionally hectoring, especially when Webb switches to the men talking in voiceover while showing these faces in closeup doing a slow blink and then a mute soulful/sad face. However, there is humour, especially when one man remembers realising that the room in which he was expected to produce the sample was the same one in which he had the initial consultation. But these uninterrupted testimonies are overextended. The Easy Bit is available on Vimeo on 29 April."
A Russian Youth review – horror and heartbreak on the eastern front,"After being blinded, a young soldier becomes a human listening post in this absorbing but quirky first world war drama",3,"Alexander Tolotukhin, a 31-year-old film-maker from Belarus and a pupil of Alexander Sokurov, makes his feature film debut with what might be called a brief cine-novella set on the eastern front of the first world war. It certainly shows Sokurov’s influences in its soft, painterly compositions and extensive dubbing that makes the dialogue sound often like a subdued murmur. It also feels like classic Russian movies such as Tarkovsky’s Ivan’s Childhood or Klimov’s Come and See.What makes it distinctive – and, unfortunately, not as good as it might have been – is an odd framing device. We don’t see the film straightforwardly. We periodically see a modern-day orchestra rehearsing the musical score that is to go on it – pieces by Rachmaninov. This is an interesting quirk in some ways, but the film would have been better without it, impeding as it does your emotional reaction to the drama and not enhancing the musical accompaniment’s meaning.Yet the story is absorbing. Alexey (Vladimir Korolev) is a fresh-faced boy with troops at the front who is blinded in a gas attack and from then on employed to listen out for advancing German aircraft. He does this at a strange monitoring post with a great funnel, which Alexey is strapped into, like a pilot – and he does well to warn everyone of an imminent attack. There are grisly episodes: despite his blindness, Alexey is beaten with Dickensian cruelty for spilling food on an officer. He has to have a tick removed from the side of his face with a knife and is always having to shake the lice out of his jacket.Eventually, the Germans close in, and poor Alexey is not much worse off than his cowed comrades. Perhaps the point is that war makes blind cattle of them all. It is a well-made little film, though the orchestral meta-level was a mistake. A Russian Youth is available on Mubi from 30 April."
Planet of the Humans review – contrarian eco-doc from the Michael Moore stable,"Jeff Gibbs’ film, produced by Michael Moore, takes a pop at green, liberal A-listers such as Al Gore – but doesn’t dare criticise Greta Thunberg",4,"Recently, petrolhead pundit Jeremy Clarkson was thought to have disgraced himself by pointing out that the hi-tech sea yacht used by Greta Thunberg for her transatlantic crossing, for all its solar panels and underwater turbines, had an old-fashioned diesel engine aboard for emergencies. I thought about Clarkson’s jibe while watching this refreshingly contrarian eco-documentary from environmentalist Jeff Gibbs, which has been uploaded for free online viewing by its executive producer, Michael Moore.Gibbs has a cheeky habit of going backstage at music festivals that solemnly declare themselves to be using 100% renewable energy, only to find that the fancy array of solar panels behind the tent is enough to power a single bass guitar. The rest of the energy is provided by just plugging into the shameful old electricity grid, provided by fossil fuels. He sees it as symptomatic of the mainstream environmental movement, running on delusional piety.All the green, liberal A-listers – Bill McKibben, Al Gore, Van Jones, Robert F Kennedy Jr – are attacked in this film as a pompous and complacent high-priest caste of the environmental movement, who are shilling for a fossil fuel industry that has sneakily taken them over. (Although it should be said that, for all his radical bravado, Gibbs does not dare criticise Thunberg.)Big Oil and its corporate and banking representatives have, according to this film, found a way to rebrand themselves as green or greenish, to use the green movement for their own ends, and to get their mitts on the huge subsidies that taxpayers around the world are handing over to anyone claiming to be developing renewable energy resources, which turn out to be the same old fossil-fuel entities in different packaging.Solar panels and wind turbines? These provide no energy when there is no sun or wind and degrade after only a few decades, says Gibbs. And in any case they need a lot of fossil fuels in their manufacture: silicon, cobalt, silver, graphite, rare earths – and of course coal. The same goes for manufacturing storage batteries. Factories claiming to have gone “beyond coal” again and again turn out to be relying on natural gas. Corporate behemoths such as Apple make spurious claims for their energy usage. But how about the ultra-fashionable new “renewable” energy source: biomass or wood-chips? This is basically a colossal logging industry that requires a lot of fossil fuel energy to harvest and transport the material. As Gibbs’ interviewees point out, you might just as well as burn the fossil fuels in the first place. And it is laying waste rainforests and areas of natural beauty.This, says Gibbs, is the queasy merger of environmentalism and capitalism – and he makes a refreshingly sceptical case. But he takes it further, suggesting that unfettered capitalism and its insanity of eternal growth on a finite planet is also what is leading us to the cliff edge. True enough, although his comments on overpopulation have an unintentionally ironic chime, in the middle of the Covid-19 outbreak.Most chillingly of all, Gibbs at one stage of the film appears to suggest that there is no cure for any of this, that, just as humans are mortal, so the species itself is staring its own mortality in the face. But he appears to back away from that view by the end, saying merely that things need to change. But what things and how?It’s not at all clear. I found myself thinking of Robert Stone’s controversial 2013 documentary Pandora’s Promise, which made a revisionist case for nuclear power: a clean energy source that (allegedly) has cleaned up its act on safety and really can provide for our wholesale energy needs without contributing to climate change, in a way that “renewables” can’t.Gibbs doesn’t mention nuclear and – a little lamely, perhaps – has no clear lesson or moral, other than the need to take a fiercely critical look at the environmental establishment. Well, it’s always valuable to re-examine a sacred cow. Planet of the Humans is available on YouTube."
Beastie Boys Story review – Spike Jonze and the boys are back in town,Ad-Rock and Mike D host a convivial trip down memory lane in this filmed record of a live show staged in tribute to third member Adam Yauch,4,"The Guardian’s product and service reviews are independent and are in no way influenced by any advertiser or commercial initiative. We will earn a commission from the retailer if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more.The release of this documentary coincides with #MeAt20, a heart-twisting craze on social media for posting pictures of yourself at 20 years old. Middle-aged people’s timelines are speckled with funny, sweet and sometimes unbearably sad images of themselves in unlined, unformed youth, doing goofy things in milky analogue pictures from back when you had 12 or 24 exposures on your roll-film camera and getting them developed at Boots was a pricey business. That’s what I thought of while watching this engaging, oddly moving film from Spike Jonze: a record of the live stage show he devised at the Kings Theatre in Brooklyn, New York, in tribute to white hip-hop stars and tongue-in-cheek party-libertarian activists the Beastie Boys. It is presented by the two surviving members, Adam Horovitz and Michael Diamond, in tribute to the third member, Adam Yauch, who died of cancer in 2012. Jonze is reuniting with the band after having directed a string of their music videos, including the crime-TV spoof for their single Sabotage in 1994.The Guardian’s product and service reviews are independent and are in no way influenced by any advertiser or commercial initiative. We will earn a commission from the retailer if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more.Horovitz and Diamond amble on stage, apparently dressed head-to-toe in Gap, and appear for all the world to be about to unveil the iPhone 4S, although actually their jokey anecdotalism makes the show in some ways like the regional tours once presented by George Best and Rodney Marsh. With amiably rehearsed back-and-forth banter, they introduce the embarrassing photos and excruciating TV clips that are shown on a big screen. And the effect of seeing them juxtaposed with the plump-faced frizzy-haired imps of 1986 is startling and bizarre. In the present day, the advancing years seem to have boiled away the badass attitude, leaving behind the quirky humour.They started out in their teens as post-punk enthusiasts for the Clash, and the photos of them at this stage are starkly black-and-white. But then the archive images turn into the garish colour of MTV. The Beastie Boys got very excited by rap, were picked up for management by the (now notorious) Russell Simmons, brother of Run DMC’s Reverend Run, and soon they were opening for Madonna. In 1986, their album Licensed to Ill happened, along with its fascinating and deplorable and horribly brilliant single (You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!) – an anthem for blearily defiant Reagan-years hedonism. I remember hearing it around the time I read PJ O’Rourke’s Republican Party Reptile.The Beastie Boys sold truckloads of records all over the world, and their puppyishly zany image co-existed with limitlessly energetic anarchy. They were, as they fondly recall, expected to be very dangerous on their foreign tours: particularly the British tour. Surreally, a full page of the Sun is flashed up on stage, and the band appear next to a giant picture of former Tory education secretary Kenneth Baker.The band’s live show featured a giant penis emerging from a box. Horovitz and Diamond explain they were intending to satirise the frat-boy image and it took over – though they have the grace to say that they didn’t really care at the time about an alleged misunderstanding that was making them globally famous and rich. However, they also appear genuinely mortified at the fact that, in the early days, they fired the only woman in their original lineup: Kate Schellenbach (now the TV producer of The Late Late Show with James Corden). They repudiate their early reputation for sexism, but nobody in the film mentions these lyrics from the early single Paul Revere: “I did it like this / I did it like that / I did it with a whiffle ball bat.”Inevitably, the Beasties spiralled financially over the top, relocating to LA where they rented a gigantic house featuring a swimming pool with a bridge over it, and went broke. Their accountant phoned to announce this event and heartlessly signed off with: “I’ve gotta go; I’ve got Donny Osmond on the other line.” A relocation back to New York, a chastened existence playing smaller clubs, and continued musical experimentation proved to be their path back up to the big league, and Yauch became a campaigner for Tibet. This film is a time capsule of the 1980s: an era that was crass and excessive in so many ways, but now seems weirdly exotic.Beastie Boys Story is available on Apple TV+ from 24 April."
Who You Think I Am review – a thrilling web of desire,Juliette Binoche is wondrous as a woman with a fantasy identity in an exploration of the perils and pleasures of life online,4,"There’s something peculiarly timely about this deliciously twisty, romantic thriller, with its themes of virtual isolation and physical separation. Freely adapted from a novel by Camille Laurens, Who You Think I Am boasts a kaleidoscopic performance by Juliette Binoche as a fiftysomething woman who has been rendered invisible by society (at one point a character literally looks at her without seeing her) but finds a new face for herself online. Pitched somewhere between the icy satire of late-period Claude Chabrol and the guilty thrills of Guillaume Canet’s Tell No One, Safy Nebbou’s mysterious tale of love and obsession will strike a chord with anyone who has worried about the random interactions of the internet while remaining inexorably drawn to the seductive glow of their iPhone.Binoche is Claire, a disillusioned divorcee who recounts her story to therapist Dr Catherine Bormans (Nicole Garcia) while we watch in flashback. Having been “unfriended” by younger lover Ludo, Claire creates a fake online persona – an alluring 24-year-old named Clara with whom Ludo’s assistant Alex (a ruffle-haired François Civil) promptly becomes infatuated. What starts as an attempt to spy on her ex soon blossoms into something more: a virtual relationship with Alex conducted with all the crackling energy of a long-distance affair. It’s intense, erotic and overwhelming. But is Alex really the subject of Claire’s affections? Or is it the thrill of becoming Clara that truly fires her passion?Slyly characterising social media as “both the shipwreck and the life raft”, the film adroitly charts Claire’s descent into a second life, increasingly removed from the rules and responsibilities of the physical world, addicted to “that little green light” on her screen, like Gatsby mesmerised by the light at the end of Daisy’s dock. One moment she’s chiding her kids for using their phones at the table, the next she’s furtively hiding her own calls, walking through supermarkets and libraries in a bubble, oblivious to the outside world. “When I was with him I felt alive,” she tells Dr Bormans, apparently forgetting that she was never “with” Alex at all. They even have sex, albeit at a distance, leaving her feeling “more like Clara than Claire”. “What are you looking for?” Bormans asks. “To live another life?” “Not another one,” snaps Claire, “mine! At last!”It’s significant that Claire is a professor of literature, well versed in the complexities of the authorial voice. We see her in lectures, discussing Les Liaisons Dangereuses; citing Marguerite Duras as a “truly independent” spirit’; unpacking the role of Nora in Ibsen’s A Doll’s House. At one point she compares her online life to a novel, and throughout the drama we watch Claire effectively writing her own story – her past, present and future. But in this brave new world, the spectre of Unfriended is never far from view, adding a tinge of horror to the unfolding psychodrama.Nebbou cites Kurosawa’s Rashomon and Hitchcock’s Vertigo as key cinematic inspirations, although I was put more in mind of Karel Reisz’s adaptation of The French Lieutenant’s Woman, with its knowingly playful deconstruction of narrative. Certainly Claire is an unreliable narrator, daring Dr Bormans to become involved in (and aroused by) her recollections, exhibiting a stalker’s desperation for some form of validating response from a stranger. But there’s also a strange sense of empowerment in Claire’s ability to un-write and then re-write her life at will, as if the internet had provided her with the ultimate blank page – a canvas upon which dreams may be made real.While the film’s mirrored visuals are as crisp and glossy as an uninterrupted high-speed broadband connection (something after which many of us lust in vain), the script by Nebbou and Julie Peyr is full of cracked humour, such as the moment when Claire is caught out using an old-fashioned colloquialism online, and has to Google “insta” before continuing her conversation. Binoche, who spends much of the movie alone in the frame, gets the tragicomic tone of these scenes just right, perfectly embodying the Claire/Clara dichotomy as two worlds collide – youth and age, physicality and fantasy, sadness and psychopathy. Her performance really is a thing of wonder, reminding me somewhat of Kristin Scott Thomas’s subtly unhinged turn in Catherine Corsini’s Leaving.Ibrahim Maalouf’s score plays dextrously upon the film’s competing themes, with strings highlighting the yearning melodrama, while an apparently innocent piano riff subtly echoes the tripping, two-note chime of Claire’s Facebook alarm. It all adds up to a very modern drama about age-old anxieties: the fear of ageing and death; the desire for intimacy and reassurance; the allure of artifice and deceit.Who You Think I Am is available on Curzon Home Cinema"
Martin Margiela: In His Own Words review – philosopher of fashion,Reiner Holzemer’s film about the media-shy Belgian designer is insightful – despite not revealing his subject’s face,4,"This fun, nerdy follow-up to Reiner Holzemer’s 2017 documentary about Dries Van Noten takes on another Belgian fashion designer, Martin Margiela. The use of the notoriously media-shy Margiela’s warm, serious spoken voice helps to create intimacy, even though we never see his face. “I don’t like the idea of being a celebrity; anonymity is very important to me,” he says, and so Holzemer simply shows us his hands. Fitting, given the man’s style philosophy is all about silhouette – “the shoulder” and “the shoe”. As a child, Margiela would cut off the toes of his Barbies’ shoes, an interesting detail that foreshadows the legacy of the cloven Tabi boots he brought to the runway in the 1980s.

Trolls World Tour review – uplifting animated sequel,Trolls fans are in for more high-octane fun in this trippy adventure voiced by Justin Timberlake and Anna Kendrick,4,"“It’s bland, the lyrics are empty, and it crawls into your brain like an earworm!” screeches Queen Barb of the Hard Rock Trolls (voiced by Crazy Ex-Girlfriend’s Rachel Bloom). As a fluffy red mohawk and fishnet tights indicate, pop music does not impress her much. Yet even viewers who share her cynicism may find themselves weak to the psychotropic pleasures offered by this trippy sequel to the 2016 animated musical extravaganza.In this latest outing, the original pop-loving Trolls discover that five other tribes exist: Techno, Funk, Classical, Country and Hard Rock, and the latter, led by Queen Barb, intends to “unite one nation of Trolls under rock”. The freshly crowned Queen Poppy (Anna Kendrick) heads up the revolution against Barb’s fascism, but the film is wry enough to know that even pop music isn’t immune to critique. A track by LMFAO from 2011 is rightly decreed “a crime against music” and funk legend George Clinton croons about cultural appropriation. Mercifully, it’s more weird than worthy.Another clever aspect of the film is the way it visually translates different musical genres. Techno Trolls have neon glow-stick hair and pulsating, pixelated hearts; the walls of “Vibe City” undulate like a 70s-style lava lamp. Fifty Shades of Grey’s Jamie Dornan cameos as the icky “Smooth Jazz Chaz”, flowing hair and siren saxophone making for a cheering comedy riff on Kenny G. The only bum note is the music itself, despite the presence of prestige pop stars including Justin Timberlake, Kelly Clarkson and Mary J Blige."
"Tigertail review – dreams, regrets and a life built on a lie",A young Taiwanese man faces an agonising choice when offered a new life in the US in this heartfelt drama from a writer of Parks and Recreation,3,"Last year, Lulu Wang’s The Farewell, starring Awkwafina, tapped into Asian-Americans’ “third generation” experience of cultural dislocation and yearning: a need to come to terms with the old country of their grandparents’ time. In that film, Awkwafina’s middle-aged dad was played by Tzi Ma, whose gentle, sensitive face mutely spoke volumes about hardship and sacrifice. He plays a very similar role in this heartfelt, flawed debut feature from Taiwanese-American director Alan Yang – whose track record is in TV comedy, having written and produced for the hit show Parks and Recreation.It is a very different work: serious and personal, clearly fictionalising at some level aspects of the director’s own family experience, and perhaps self-conscious in a way that successful comedy isn’t. Sometimes the transitions and flashbacks are a bit on the nose, and the modern-day sequences have a TV-movie look to them. And yet there is a real emotional surge in the way Yang conjures the past.Tzi Ma is Pin-Jui, a divorced Taiwanese guy living in New York, who has a tense relationship with his grownup daughter, Angela (Christine Ko). He has just returned to the city, having made a melancholy journey back to his hometown of Huwei (or “Tigertail”) to attend the funeral of his mother (Kuei-Mei Yang) whom he could never persuade to join him in the US. The experience triggers a rush of memories: living with grandmother as a child under Chinese rule, and then as a young man (played by Hong-chi Lee), full of dreams and swagger, in love with his childhood sweetheart, Yuan (Yo-Hsing Fang), with whom he dances to American-style pop music in the local bars. But, above everything, he dreams of leaving Taiwan for America, and hanging out with Faye Dunaway. Yuan loves America, too, being a fan of Otis Redding. But Pin-Jui is very poor.A terrible choice presents itself. The manager of the factory where Pin-Jui and his mum have jobs takes him aside and asks him to have dinner with his demure daughter, Zhenzhen (Kunjue Li), and tells him that, if they get married, he will pay for them to travel and get set up in the States. It is a powerful moment when Pin-Jui, having always been ashamed to take Yuan back to the humble place he shares with his widowed mother, finally does so, and Yang indirectly suggests that this is the point at which they have sex for the first time, but also when Pin-Jui is trying to show Yuan how desperately poor he is, so she will understand his need to get away at all costs.And so Pin-Jui’s whole life is founded on a lie: a loveless marriage to a gentle, sensitive person who senses down deep that something is wrong but, schooled in the wifely duties of submission, simply thinks that all marriages are as tough and unhappy as hers. Zhenzhen’s one friend is fellow Taiwanese Peijing (Cindera Che), who is quite unsentimental about her own unsatisfactory marriage. When Zhenzhen confides to her that she and her husband have nothing in common, she says: “Eventually, your life together is what you have in common.” That is a grim thought – and yet many modern-day Americans, immigrants or otherwise, have seen their parents make the best of things in just this way.The scenes of childhood and youth work very well, but the modern-day part of the film is directed in an oddly flat way, and the all-important scenes with Angela have little of the charge that Yang puts into the earlier sequences. It is as if memory is a vital ingredient that makes the drama live, with a throb that the here-and-now doesn’t have.Yet there is one very good moment. Poor Angela, as a teenager, has to play the piano at a school concert with her parents in the audience, and makes a mess of it – to her own horror and her parents’ suppressed mortification and disapproval. Pin-Jui harshly tells Angela not to cry, just as his own tough grandmother told him. And so the cycle of pain continues. A sombre, well-acted film about sacrifice and regret. Tigertail is available on Netflix from 10 April."
"Coffee & Kareem review – fast, filthy and fitfully funny Netflix comedy",A handful of amusing lines and a standout turn from Glow’s Betty Giplin can’t elevate this crass and convoluted spin on a familiar buddy movie setup,2,"There’s a better movie buried underneath the many corpses in the crude and confused Netflix comedy Coffee & Kareem, one of their algorithmically assembled weekend options patchworked together from a stack of search terms. It’s an attempt to update a buddy movie formula that flourished most in the 1980s with films like 48 Hours, Turner & Hooch and Tango & Cash but with a half-open eye on the current climate. The most recent theatrical attempt, the Kumail Nanjiani/Dave Bautista-starring Stuber, flopped last summer while Netflix has seen its own, the Mark Wahlberg/Winston Duke vehicle Spenser Confidential, reportedly score huge streaming numbers, despite a small issue of quality.It’s a platform that then makes a lot more sense for a throwback such as this with Stuber director Michael Dowse returning to try his luck again within similar territory, in extremely quick succession. It’s based on a script from the first-time writer Shane Mack, one that attracted enough attention in 2014 to be included on the Black List, an annual roundup of the best unproduced screenplays doing the rounds. There’s just about enough here to see why with Mack’s knack for comedy, both broad and weirdly specific, proving that at the very least he’d make a solid inclusion in any sitcom writers room. His dialogue is overstuffed with quips but for every one that lands, about five others tank, with an overreliance on lewd one-liners.In the first 15 minutes we’re promised something far more entertaining than what the following 70 minutes deliver. Incompetent cop John Coffee (Ed Helms) is dating single mother Vanessa (Taraji P Henson), much to the annoyance of her son Kareem (Terrence Little Gardenhigh), who is forced to spend time with him after school one day. In a set of circumstances that would seem far-fetched even if the film were animated and populated by talking animals, the two end up on the run from some “bad guys” after the same criminal who escaped from Coffee’s custody is also approached by Kareem to beat Coffee up. The pair have to then get along etc, etc.The lack of certification on Netflix content and any restrictions that would then come with it has meant that quite often, films or shows that would otherwise be tailored for a wide PG-13 audience are given a free pass to go hard R. It can be jarring to suddenly hear the word cunt in an otherwise tame romantic comedy and in Coffee & Kareem, a silly kids movie set-up is matched with an overwhelmingly aggressive crudeness as every opportunity for puerile jokes about shit, dicks, asses and rape are rolled out until any shock value has been completely beaten to a pulp. The novelty of watching a 12-year-old curse was tested in last year’s Good Boys, a joke that isn’t unfunny the first time or maybe even the second but when it becomes a lazy substitute for, say, an actual witticism soon starts to grow dull.It’s a strange movie that can seem mildly interested in tackling bigger issues before swiftly backing down. Any contemporary comedy about the dynamic between a white cop and a black boy can’t avoid the uncomfortable reality that we often associate with such a pairing and Mack’s script highlights the distrust that Kareem understandably has for Coffee. But its treatment feels a bit too flip for such an uneasy subject and elsewhere Mack relies on tired stereotype subversions such as the black henchmen who are, twist, surprisingly sensitive and the black stripper who is, twist, surprisingly academically ambitious, that feel patronising at best. There’s also a confused attempt to make some sort of comment on the gay panic humour that often pervades films such as this but Mack’s long-running joke, that to scare men away you have to pretend to be aggressively gay, isn’t smartly employed enough for it to work as satire and, as such, just comes off as a bit questionable.For a film centred on the relationship between two male characters, it’s actually the women who end up stealing the show, with Henson, who really deserves so much better than this, proving to be an energetic comic presence once again, giving far more than her thankless role requires and Betty Gilpin, as Coffee’s cop nemesis, bringing a solid 80% of the film’s funniest moments. Gilpin, excellent on Glow, the best thing about toothless Trump America satire The Hunt and hysterical on chatshows, is having so much fun on screen that I started to crave whatever she was on, which would make the film’s mess of a final act that much more palatable.Barely 90 minutes and barely memorable enough to stay in one’s mind for any longer, Coffee & Kareem is truly decaf entertainment.Coffee & Kareem is available on Netflix now"
Hugh Grant's guilty pleasures: rediscovering the saucy and Sapphic curios of his back catalogue,"From a salacious reimagining of the life of Norman Lindsay to serpent cults and sadistic melodramas, Hugh Grant’s early films are eminently streamable ",0,"I’m not sure what has been more curious about Hugh Grant in recent months: his breaking stammering-toff type to play a geezer in Guy Ritchie’s The Gentlemen, or his becoming an unlikely Twitter hero as @HackedOffHugh. He’s given the blue bird to Boris Johnson (an “over-promoted rubber bath toy” leading a “gang of masturbatory prefects”); reminded Piers Morgan that his paper hacked actor Nigel Havers’ phone while his wife was dying of cancer; and posted his own mugshot when trolls attempted to wind him up about his 1995 arrest for receiving oral sex from a sex worker.Given this glorious renaissance, it seemed like a good time to further cement the cult of Hugh and unearth three streamable – and coincidentally rather softcore and Sapphic – curios from his back catalogue.This camp horror was directed by Ken Russell (Tommy, Women in Love) with a smirkingly wooden script. Grant plays James, a toff whose ancestors – legend has it – had run-ins with a mythical white worm. As Peter Walker wrote of Grant’s performance in the Guardian’s My Guilty Pleasure series, “I fancy you can sometimes see a flash of panic in his eyes, as if he’s wondering if a 2:1 from Oxford should really lead to this,” but still, he’s one of the few actors here not struggling with his accent.Grant is pitted against Amanda Donohoe’s Lady Silvia Marsh, dominatrix head of a serpent cult, who delivers her lines with all the vocal relish of Vincent Price, even when topless or when fellating a Boy Scout to death in a Jacuzzi. In a 1999 interview with The AV Club, Grant recalled that Russell would slur: ‘“Do it how I showed you, you fuckin’ cunt!’ Which is not classic Ingmar Bergman direction.”Ah, but dream sequences, saxophone, strap-ons – this film’s got it all.Buy or rent The Lair of the White Worm on YouTubeBefore we proceed, you should know that this erotic thriller is both set on a cruise ship and directed by Roman Polanski. Grant plays Nigel, an out-of-touch toff who has a tendency to make Prince Philip-style faux pas.He’s in a buttoned-up relationship with Fiona (Kristin Scott Thomas), and it’s pushed to its limits when he meets bitter drunk Oscar (Peter Coyote), who’s keen to ply Nigel with whisky and bend his ear about his sexually and emotionally sadistic relationship with young French dancer, Mimi, played by Emmanuelle Seigner (who is Polanski’s wife).At first, Nigel is far too British to want to know the coarser details, but before too long, he too is obsessed by Mimi and the twisted role-reversal that occurs in this Parisian affair. Unapologetically melodramatic, Bitter Moon climaxes with a scene scored by Bryan Ferry’s Slave to Love.Buy or rent Bitter Moon on YouTubeGrant is Tony, a progressive English reverend sent to the Blue Mountains with his wife Estella (Tara Fitzgerald) to take to task artist Norman Lindsay (yes that Norman Lindsay, played by Sam Neill) for his profane paintings. Once sequestered at the artist’s estate and introduced to his witchy trio of sultry muses – played by Portia de Rossi, Elle Macpherson and Kate Fischer – Tony and Estella start to feel some distinctly un-British stirrings.Grant seems in his element here; both able to stammer and go red on cue and work with his own dry sense of humour. Much of the joy of Sirens, though, is director John Duigan’s delight in rubbing quintessential Englishness up against ocker Australianness. The cast includes Ben Mendelsohn and John Polson as sheep shearers, and then-model Mark Gerber – now boss of the Oxford Art Factory – playing the blind and mute handyman everyone lusts after.Gerber tells Guardian Australia that he became Grant’s drinking partner at the Fairmont Resort – which the studio had taken over – at one point going over the script to Grant’s next film, Four Weddings and a Funeral, in Grant’s hotel room. “We’d be drinking whisky till five in the morning and I thought, my god, you must be a machine,” Gerber says. “Maybe he was method acting, because there was one scene where he had to act quite disheveled.”Buy or rent Sirens on YouTube or watch on Amazon Prime"
Hamlet review – the Wooster Group resurrect Richard Burton's Dane,Available onlineJohn Gielgud’s 1964 production of Shakespeare’s play haunts this meta-spectacle that questions the nature of performance,3,"The Guardian’s product and service reviews are independent and are in no way influenced by any advertiser or commercial initiative.

We will earn a commission from the retailer if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more.This is a show preoccupied with ghosts, especially those of Hamlets past. In 1964, Richard Burton starred in John Gielgud’s Broadway production, which, in a pioneering move, was recorded with multiple cameras and shown in cinemas across the US. “The immediacy,” Burton said in a trailer, “the sense of being there, is unlike any experience you have ever known.” The master tapes were meant to be destroyed after the four scheduled showings, but two copies survived. Forty-two years later, New York-based avant-garde company the Wooster Group edited and reconstructed Burton’s production on stage. In 2013 they filmed their production, at Edinburgh’s Royal Lyceum theatre, and in light of the shutdown have made it freely available online until 7 April.We watch through a single static camera. On a largely undressed stage, a projection shows the grainy black-and-white 1964 film. Scott Shepherd, playing Hamlet, explains how he has edited the original film, plucking out pauses he dislikes and controlling Burton’s performance like one of his players. Synchronising their words and movements to the edits, the Wooster Group’s performances are jagged, jolting comically to keep up with the jump-cuts and fast-forwarded scenes. It’s a striking spectacle, a challenging provocation and a playful demonstration of control, but the unnatural metre untethers the words from their meanings, and the lack of emotion gradually becomes tiresome.The ideas beneath the layers of performance – how long should a legacy last? Are all performances haunted by their predecessors? Can a camera capture the rapture of an audience? – are easier to engage with in a theatre or cinema, where attention is undivided. At home, it’s easy for distractions to win out, particularly when the one-shot archival recording lacks the multi-camera richness of the NT Live or other screen versions. The static nature of both camera and performance seems to strip away the sense of immediacy, and as a result, it all feels less like actually being there.Online (Vimeo link, until 7 April)"
The Other Lamb review – artful cult drama simmers with unease,The English language debut from Małgorzata Szumowska tells of a toxic male leader of an all-female cult with striking visuals and patchy intrigue,3,"At the outset of The Other Lamb, a disquieting little drama landing online this week, we’re dropped into familiar yet fertile territory. A charismatic and handsome male leader has assembled a group of subservient female followers living together in the wild, hanging on his every word. Like most cults, it’s one based on a rigid and regressive set of gender norms. He speaks, they listen. He demands, they comply. He takes, they give.The many fascinating questions such a dynamic raises – the hows and whys, logistically and psychologically – have given cults an ongoing prominence on screen, from The Wicker Man all the way through to Wild Wild Country. How does a collective belief in something so outwardly unhinged sustain itself, and how long can that realistically last? In the English-language debut from the acclaimed Polish film-maker Małgorzata Szumowska, we join a group already steeped in its own traditions, dictated by the Shepherd (Michiel Huisman). There are wives and sisters, all of whom are guided by his word, his control of their narrative so suffocating that even stories not told by him are forbidden.As one of the sisters, Selah (Raffey Cassidy), comes of age, the love and respect she’d always held for her leader starts to show cracks. The atmosphere he’s created doesn’t allow for independent thought or for women to possess any agency, but the more she starts to learn about the Shepherd and what happens when he deigns to give a chosen follower his “grace”, the more her entire belief system starts to unravel.Gliding close to genre tropes but moving more comfortably as an uneasy drama about the alarming power of blind faith, The Other Lamb is an intriguing mood piece, strikingly made and well-performed if not quite as powerful as it could have been. It’s a slow burn, flickering quietly as it shows us Selah’s gradual, horrifying realisation of what she’s a part of and Catherine S McMullen’s spare script does a nifty job of likening a certain form of religious fervour to being in an abusive relationship. There are dream sequences that err further toward horror territory but it’s ultimately a tale of sadness, of women duped by a monster, one who fooled them into thinking he knew something they didn’t. In one of the more poignant moments, Selah asks one of his wives, now deemed “broken” and forced to live close to yet separate from the group, why she’s stayed for so long. “Because … I’m afraid,” she replies. “I’ve been here for so long, I don’t know who I am any more.”The women are judged by their age, submissiveness and desirability and as we learn more about the Shepherd’s sexual proclivities, we learn that his calmness hides something more sadistic. His control over the women is absolute and Selah’s journey toward understanding the truth requires her to learn the importance of her own independence. Without forcing the point, the film sews the thread between the cult we see and between the gender dynamic in many relationships even now, of men who treat women like property and of women who confuse this for love. But it’s a slight movie and the central relationship between Selah and the Shepherd is thinly etched, which makes their final confrontation that much less impactful. The ending itself is too abrupt and falls back on the film’s less successful lurches into horror.With sparse dialogue, Cassidy, who impressed in The Killing of a Sacred Deer before getting lost in the mess of Vox Lux, and Huisman, who played a similarly nefarious figure in The Invitation, are both required to base the majority of their performances on the unsaid. Like the film surrounding them, they’re aesthetically magnetic if a little underpowered. Szumowska is a visually confident director capable of constructing some magnificent imagery, but it’s a film that’s forever threatening to be more style than substance. By the end, there’s just about enough to stop that from becoming the case but for it to haunt further than the end credits, it really needed more.The Other Lamb is released to stream in the US on 3 April and in the UK later this year"
System Crasher review – gripping tale of a nine-year-old on the edge,Child actor Helena Zengel is terrifying as a violent problem kid who tests the limits of everyone around her in this compelling German drama,4,"A terrifying performance from nine-year-old German actor Helena Zengel is at the centre of this sombre drama from Nora Fingscheidt. She plays Benni, a violent, uncontrolled and near-feral problem kid who takes the social services to breaking point and beyond. At one stage, a strategic soundtrack use of Nina Simone’s track Ain’t Got No – I Got Life seems to suggest that we should sympathise with Benni as a tiny whirlwind force of nature who resists being crushed by drab authority.But that’s not how this gruesome, compelling film is playing out. Most of the time, Benni is simply scary, a sociopath in training, quite unteachable and unreformable, horrible to the people trying to help her like the scorpion that stings the frog because that’s its nature. Benni has a charming streak that has seduced a number of social workers to make an emotional investment in her, to take risks for her, to go out on a limb for her, only for her to let them down and in a sense to consume them as eagerly and unrepentantly as a vampire. All the time, her dials are up to 11, screaming, laughing too loud, swearing, punching.Her key social worker, Frau Bafané (Gabriela Maria Schmeide), tries to get Benni into special schools or facilities; dozens turn her down and Benni is too young to be effectively incarcerated as an inpatient. While Benni is eerily unaffected, the strain takes its toll on Bafané, reducing her to an emotional wreck, and the same is true of another social worker, Micha (Albrecht Schuch), a tough young guy who is no pushover, and who takes Benni away for a tough-love stay in his cabin in the woods.It’s a trip that involves borderline-inappropriate intimacy with this intense child – a risk that appears not to have occurred to the entirely blameless Micha. And all the time, the stakes get higher and the morale lower. There are times, when Zengel is performing with other children, especially younger children, when you get the strange sense that this isn’t acting – it is actually happening. A grisly, gripping watch. System Crasher is available on Curzon Home Cinema and Mubi from 27 March."
Domains review – eerie echoes of a world in isolation,"This stark, experimental drama about a woman in a troubled marriage who reconnects with an old friend is the first movie of the coronavirus era",4,"The first movie of the coronaviral era is already here. Domains, from Japanese film-maker Natsuka Kusano, premiered last year at the Rotterdam film festival, so it was conceived and made well before the outbreak. But with eerie relevance, it speaks to the spirit of our times, featuring sparsely populated or empty streets, characters who always stay a few feet apart, who don’t touch and rarely speak face-to-face, and in any case only with a weird dislocation and alienation. There’s a character who objects to the isolation in which another character appears to be locking down his family and demands to know if this man considers her a “virus” who has to be kept well away. In her own domain, in fact.Along with many others recently, I’ve been curating lists of feelgood movies to keep everyone cheerful – and we’re all tweeting merrily about how odd it is to see people in films recklessly hugging and wantonly touching each other. Feelgood anthologising is an entirely valid cinephile activity. Who knows how vital a global resource it may yet turn out to be as the months stretch ahead? Yet, however intensely non-fun this particular movie is, it’s a relief to engage with a type of cinema that presents itself as something other than a comfort blanket.Domains is a stark, experimental chamber piece, directed by Kusano and written by Tomoyuki Takahashi (who worked on Ryûsuke Hamaguchi’s film Happy Hour) with a self-deconstructing self-awareness that feels like something from the French New Wave. The title evidently echoes the 1956 exhibition of the same name from Japanese photographer Ikko Narahara.We start in a police station where one character is confessing to a murder, and doing so with deliberative calmness, making it clear that this was no accident. From there we flash back to scenes involving three people affected by the crime. Aki (Asami Shibuya) is a single woman taking a break from her job in publishing due a breakdown that is never entirely specified. She has recently reconnected with her old schoolfriend, Nodoka (Tomo Kasajima), who is now married to a cold, controlling and abusive man called Naoto (Tomomitsu Adachi); they have a small daughter, Honoka. The two women are galvanised by the revival of shared girlhood memories, but their intimacy deeply irritates the charmless Naoto, and he is infuriated when his wife lets Aki buy presents for Honoka; he blames this interloper for getting Honoka feverishly overexcited and ill. Soon he demands that his wife shuns her.But this is not shown straight: we simply see the actors rehearsing the scenes, mostly with the script in front of them. The same scenes are played over and over again, with changes in emphasis and intonation and camera placement, and very occasionally new lines are included, with the director occasionally heard, off-camera, though never seen.The effect is unexpected. The endless Groundhog Day repetition of these moments – key “prologue” scenes to the crime – has the effect of magnifying the scenes and rendering them more amenable to scrutiny. It allows us, the audience, to examine them, to pick them apart. But to what end? Again and again, the question of motive will come up in our minds, just as it does in the characters’. Yet motive always remains opaque.And what is happening in these enigmatic “rehearsal” scenes anyway? Are we seeing the characters themselves, trying to engage with their own past, like Pirandellian figures adrift in a play whose meaning they can’t work out? Do they go through these scenes repeatedly, the way all of us can listlessly go over painful memories, trying to make sense of them, get to the truth of them like a cop or a judge, actually trying to knead them into blankness so they are bearable?At the beginning, we will see the police officer (in that initial “real” scene) reading back the confession statement in precisely the same unengaged tone that everyone else is to use. This police transcript appears to have the same status as the film script. It is the official document, which appears to give a black-and-white fixity and meaning to inchoate events. But this meaning is elusive.Domains speaks of unease, emotional containment, the societal need to carry on and the fear of something growing out of control. “Be careful,” says Naoto to his cowed wife about Aki, “or her influence is going to spread.” Troubling though it is to say right now, this film is about a suppressed dread of something fatal just around the corner. Domains is streaming on Mubi."
Conclusions by John Boorman review – film gossip and nostalgia,"The film-maker on Gerard Depardieu’s snoring, Burt Reynolds’s sexual skills and why boxset TV is disappointing",0,"“I am a man I never had time to get to know,” announces the film-maker John Boorman, director of Point Blank (1967) and Deliverance (1972), halfway through this not-quite memoir. “I suspected he was a fraud, a liar, full of hollow passion, best kept locked away.” It’s a pensive, unexpectedly self-chastening admission in a section titled “Solitude”. Mulling a little longer, he adds: “I can’t say I like him, but since it is just the two of us, we are learning to get along. I have even found it possible to forgive him. He no longer embarrasses me, nor do I feel the need to apologise for him.”Why, one wonders, would Boorman ever have been embarrassed by himself? Born in Carshalton, south London in 1933, he left school at 16 and worked for a dry-cleaners, but was soon writing essays for the Manchester Guardian and as a critic for BBC Radio’s Under-Twenty Review show. During national service the lectures he gave to Korea-bound troops on the background to the war inspired one of them, Labour MP Ian Mikardo’s son, to declare he couldn’t serve in such an immoral struggle. Boorman was arrested and charged with “seducing a soldier from the course of his duty”, only for the court martial against him to be dropped when it became clear that the chief source for his seditious propaganda was the Times.Boorman’s previous book, Adventures of a Suburban Boy (2003) was a more linear account of his directorial career that included not only his notable successes but the box-office catastrophe Exorcist II (1977). Conclusions is more fragmented, a commonplace book that includes advice for budding screenwriters; tributes to the BBC where, as a young documentarian, he was given freedom to experiment and to “paint with light”; and fond recollections of the characters he has encountered in his years living in Ireland (among them a “poetic conman” with the splendid name Shit Mackey).The chapters teem with gossipy though never mean anecdotes. He recalls the 1992 Cannes film festival where he often had to shake and sometimes punch Gerard Depardieu who, even though he was jury president, habitually fell asleep and started snoring as soon as the lights went down on the films being screened in competition. He marvels at how the famously bibulous John Hurt managed to win a best dramatic actor award in spite of the fact that “he had not read the script, did not know the name of the character he was playing, or even the name of the film” in which he had appeared.Some of his stories can be unexpectedly moving. Burt Reynolds, shortly after he appeared in Cosmopolitan as a nude centrefold, confessed to him that he felt awkward about his new-found sex-symbol status. “He told me that women expected something amazing from their experiences with him. ‘But,’ he said ruefully, ‘I’m just a fumbler like everyone else.’” David Lean confides in him: “‘The tragedy of my life is that I always took the women who wanted me. I never had the courage to go after the women I wanted.’ ‘Does that apply to all five wives?’ I said. ‘Absolutely,’ he replied morosely.’”Best of all is his account of Harold Pinter’s vanity and insecurity about his poetry. Every time it appeared in the Observer he would buy a bundle of copies and send them to friends who were expected to tell him how great they found the verse. On one occasion, Pinter sent a two-line poem to the playwright Simon Gray. (“I saw Len Hutton in his prime / Another time, another time.”) Not getting any reply, he rang Gray and asked him if he’d received the poem. And then: “Did you read it?” “I am only halfway through it,” Gray replied.For all its gaiety, Conclusions is permeated with loss and a sense of time running out. Boorman notes the death of friends and conspirators such as Ken Russell and John Schlesinger. And words, the right words, increasingly elude him: “If I wait patiently, they float up, and I recapture them.” Nature is a partial solace. He includes his own poetry – about larches, oak trees, water – some of which is accompanied by hand-drawn sketches. The bigger loss, to which he often returns with eloquence and insight – is film itself. He mourns the shift to digital (“dirt and scratches on the screen are a thing of the past”), film’s shrinkage from big screens to laptops and smartphone, and the damage done to narrative structures by TV programmes financed by streaming platforms: “Movies are always seeking endings that grow out of the body of the story, that are earned and satisfying, whereas the series is searching for material that will let it continue. It must avoid endings at all costs.” The feature film, he believes, “is a director’s medium; the TV series is usually dictated by a producer or, as they are now called, a show runner … I find the results tedious, the obligations to watch a chore.”In the end, what makes Conclusions so delightful is Boorman’s awareness of how absurd cinema is. Absurd as in non-rational, dreamlike, an escape from what passes for reality. Cinema as collective dreaming, a permission to dream. “Committing yourself to the life of a film-maker is to embrace a form of joyous slavery,” he writes. What romance!

Crip Camp review – rousing Netflix documentary traces disability rights movement,"Starting at a freewheeling camp in the 70s and ending with profound political change, this impactful film shines a light on a forgotten fight for equality",4,"In the impactful new Netflix documentary Crip Camp, we’re told a story so remarkable that it seems as if we should already know it or at least have a vague awareness of its existence. It starts with something small, a camp in upstate New York for those with disabilities, and ends with something big, an impassioned civil rights movement that led to vital systemic change. Like many of the best documentaries, more and more of which have been cropping up on Netflix, it educates us on an underrepresented minority, adding nuance and specificity to an experience that might have previously been painted in broad strokes, the kind of film that shouldn’t just be recommended viewing but also required.Premiering to great acclaim earlier this year at Sundance, after securing the Obamas as executive producers, Crip Camp is in itself the small film that became something big, now reaching millions of, quite literally given the pandemic, captive viewers. It starts in 1971 in the Catskills at Camp Jened, a loose, free-spirited camp designed for teens with disabilities. It was a utopia for kids who felt alienated and sidelined, a rare haven devoid of judgment and discrimination, an eye-opening experience for so many who’d felt shut out for so long. The teens who’d previously been rejected were suddenly accepted, moving from high school classes in the basement out into the light.Directors Nicole Newnham and Jim LeBrecht immerse us at Jened through an invaluable amount of vintage footage as well as interviews with surviving participants. The freewheeling vibe of the camp, likened to Woodstock, is matched by a similarly unstructured first act which sits us with the teens as they play, smoke, flirt and, most interestingly, discuss key issues with each other. For so many of them, this was their first opportunity to speak about the intricacies of their experience, which admittedly were different given their range of disabilities, but there’s a thrill in watching them bond, especially in one illuminating scene where they lament the lack of alone time they’re allowed, protective parents never far away.But the camp is only the beginning and once the teens leave after the summer of 71, the film moves on to what life looked like and how that formative experience left an indelible impression. It was no longer acceptable to live in the background, to accept status as second-class citizens, and so many of them used this newfound, or newly awakened, energy to demand political change. The inarguable breakout star of the film is Judy Heumann, who was a counsellor at the camp and went on to lead the movement, fearlessly confronting a system that was intimidatingly stacked against her. She’s a captivating central figure, persuasively, passionately petitioning for equity and in one of the film’s most powerful moments, when certain legislation is passed, she poignantly refuses to be grateful for the basic right of an accessible bathroom.It’s a film that takes small, incremental leaps until we’re finally made aware of the bigger picture, of the brave strides made by people who met at a camp and realised that what they were being offered in their lives wasn’t good enough. It’s rousing stuff, especially when we see how Black Panthers and LGBTQ+ activists at the time rallied alongside, aware that their individual fights were ultimately not that different, and it’s one that’s similarly not over. The shameful lack of wheelchair access within New York’s subway system, which the film traces back to callous decision-making in the 70s, remains a major problem while disability groups have filed a complaint about Covid-19-based discrimination just this week.There’s understandable anger here but also humour and insight, Newnham and LeBrecht allowing those in the film to be seen as sexual, ambitious, funny, interesting individuals, more than what society has too often allowed. It’s as involving as it is necessary, a rare ray of sunshine on yet another cloudy day.Crip Camp is available on Netflix from 25 March"
And Then We Danced review – heady tale of forbidden desire,Tbilisi is the setting for this charged romance between two men training as traditional Georgian dancers,4,"Real-life dancer Levan Gelbakhiani is Mehrab, a redhead with round, watchful eyes training as part of the National Georgian Ensemble in Tbilisi. It’s in his blood – his delinquent older brother David (Giorgi Tsereteli) is a dancer too, as were his parents and ageing grandmother. A macho discipline that comprises forceful military moves and elaborate, athletic leaps, the tradition of Georgian dancing contains “no room for weakness” and certainly “no sex”, according to Mehrab’s teacher. Enter new student Irakli (Bachi Valishvili), tall, dark and handsome with a twinkle in his eye and a spring in his step that knocks Mehrab sideways. Swedish writer-director Levan Akin’s heady third feature is attuned to the way desire has a tendency to throw everyday mundanities into sharp relief.Mehrab is indifferent when dance partner Mary (Ana Javakishvili) falls asleep on his shoulder, but when it’s Irakli, he’s silently elated. Most of the boys’ increasingly charged interactions play out in the studio before the sun has risen, and after hours, over a lamp’s orange glow; cinematographer Lisabi Fridell bathes their blooming attraction in syrupy amber light. A street lamp illuminates a private show and turns it gold, as Mehrab dances shirtless for Irakli to Robyn’s seductive track Honey. This awakening eventually leads him to one of Tbilisi’s underground gay clubs. Gelbakhiani is commanding in his first acting role, metabolising heartbreak and moving with an irrepressible prowling sensuality.In ultra-conservative Georgia, desire between two men remains strictly taboo. And so longing throbs like a sickness in small, unacknowledged gestures like the careful folding of a would-be lover’s T-shirt or a juicy, bleeding pomegranate (recalling, perhaps, Call Me By Your Name’s peach). Luca Guadagnino’s queer romance might seem like a reference point, but that film’s swanky Italian villa is a world away from Mehrab’s, with his precarious restaurant job and out-of-credit mobile phone. Here, the stakes are higher, and so the romance sweeter."
Big Time Adolescence review – Pete Davidson plays to type in low-key comedy,"The Saturday Night Live star is a perma-slacker in this shaggy, warmly received Sundance coming-of-age tale which has finally shown up on Hulu",3,"After it premiered to mostly strong notices at Sundance in 2019, Big Time Adolescence seemed like an easy sell in theory, one of the easiest of that year’s crop of premieres: commercial, crowd-pleasing and the first major film role for a headline-grabbing comic. But it remained on the shelf for longer than expected, a full nine months before Neon and Hulu partnered for a relatively meagre $4m pickup. The lethargy was perhaps a sign of how difficult it has become to sell a big screen comedy fronted by a teen with streamers like Netflix instead becoming the go-to for a film such as this, appealing to a younger audience who have grown to reserve the multiplex for more pronounced events.So something this slick and this charming will prove to be a warm surprise for US viewers heading to Hulu this weekend, for more than one reason. Deftly realising the public hunger to watch new films at home as a pandemic threatens to shut down cinemas, the Disney-owned platform made the decision to drop Big Time Adolescence a week earlier than anticipated, tying in with its one week theatrical window, a small, token release that now seems entirely redundant given the sure-to-be-quiet state of the box office this weekend.Having seen the film both at its hyped festival premiere and now on the small screen, it feels far more comfortable in the latter scenario, a shaggy, low-key coming-of-age comedy that’s happily a world away from current, consuming concerns of Covid-19. It’s the story of Monroe, or Mo (Griffin Gluck), a 16-year-old whose only real friend is his sister’s ex-boyfriend Zeke (Pete Davidson), a twentysomething slacker who wears his inability to grow up as a badge of honour. As Mo is pushed to connect more others of his own age, he starts to question whether Zeke is the best friend he once thought he was.There’s not much to Nancy Meyers assistant turned writer-director Jason Orley’s first-time feature but there’s just about enough to prove diverting as well as promising for the future, when Orley has a story that’s a bit more distinctive to tell. Big Time Adolescence is a film about stunted growth, about a man whose best years were in high school and, while not as caustic as Jason Reitman and Diablo Cody’s Young Adult, it shares a similarly stark view of what happens next. Zeke’s idea of cool is one that hasn’t changed since he was 16 and so him and Mo continue to gravitate towards each other in away that’s messily both good and bad for them. Good because they share a loving brotherly connection that runs deeper than the surface-level laddishness might suggest and bad because the effects of Zeke’s strident immaturity are stalling them.The film works best when it’s studying the characters at its centre and their difficult dynamic, a fragile friendship that slowly starts to crumble with more exposure to the world around it. It’s less effective when it focuses on the specifics of the plot, a thinly etched set of circumstances involving high school parties, weed and climactic confrontations that will prove familiar to savvy audiences. Much was made of Davidson’s role at Sundance but it’s his co-star Gluck who steals the show. Davidson, an uncomfortably limited performer on Saturday Night Live, is playing a slightly exaggerated version of himself and there’s very little here to suggest that he’ll be equipped to do anything else. But Gluck, last seen in Netflix’s Tall Girl, offers a far more accomplished performance, perfecting a specific sort of self-possessed confidence that works well around certain social groups yet falters around others. He’s figuring out who he is and who he wants to be and the more he gains perspective on Zeke, he’s beginning to understand what to avoid at the risk of never fully growing up as well.It’s a gentle, predictable film that doesn’t exactly put any steps wrong in its depiction of adolescence but Orley doesn’t quite do enough right for it to linger in the memory for longer than the credits. The big in the title is a misnomer.Big Time Adolescence is now available on Hulu in the US with a UK date yet to be announced"
The Rise of the Synths review – the world's most nostalgic music scene,"This documentary exploring the 80s-obsessed synthwave sound has admirable production values, but trades deep analysis for platitudes and boring asides",2,"If you have ever strutted around in sunglasses and a silken bomber jacket, and didn’t even have to try to keep a straight face, chances are you’re into synthwave. This subcultural genre of music, characterised by anthemic analogue synth lines, is explored in this stylish but shallow documentary.The partly crowdfunded film makes a reverse historical sweep of the genre, ending where the music started with the sober, even ascetic work of Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream. This was gloriously cheapened by Giorgio Moroder, who made the sound aspirational and decadent, inspiring not only pop but also film soundtracks, where synth sounds were easy signifiers for the future. The style fell out of favour as the 90s embraced guitars again, but Daft Punk became the key act to bring it back – their light-up pyramid stage set is the defining icon of the synthwave aesthetic – and influenced a host of new producers.Social media and blogging play their parts, as people start to share their fetish for the neon lights and kitsch fonts of the 80s as well as the music. Stranger Things, today’s most 80s-nostalgic pop culture, has a theme that is pure synthwave; another key moment is the 2011 Nicolas Winding Refn film Drive, which deployed a synthwave soundtrack and, married to the nihilistic glamour of Ryan Gosling’s lead character, cemented its hipster kudos. Perhaps the best definition is music that makes you feel cool while walking at night.Director Iván Castell employs a diverse and global set of talking heads, which gives a sense how far the genre has pervaded, aided by the internet – he hops from New York and Toronto to Antwerp, Grenoble and beyond. Unfortunately, many are given to platitudes of the “just make the music you want to make” variety, or asides such as “I used Fruity Loops [production software] for Christ’s sake!” which will baffle anyone but their fellow nerds, who are perhaps the only viable audience for this film. Leading lights of the scene such as Kavinsky, Johnny Jewel, M83 or Survive are conspicuously absent.Castell does admittedly snag John Carpenter, whose own synth scores gave such drama to Escape from New York and the rest. Carpenter is employed as a sensei-like narrator, recording his observations on to a cassette tape to be taken back in time by a Gosling-type pretty-boy street punk driving a DeLorean, in a series of impressively produced interstitial segments. This fantasy narrative gives the film its backwards-tracking structure to return to the source of synthwave, though Carpenter speaks as if he’s reading an autocue that’s been set up two yards too far away, and his rhapsodic guff about the “rebel beauty” of the genre and his wise-old-sage pronouncements – “don’t intellectualise it, it all comes down to one thing, instinct, that’s what you must keep close to you” – are classy filler.There are some interesting moments. It’s notable how many of the producers appear anonymously, filmed in the dark or, like Gost, behind a black veil with a skull perched on his knee. One puts this introversion down to them being “bundles of self-doubt”; others say it’s to focus on the music and escape the banality of today’s image-led social media. British trio Gunship, who drive a car with a keyboard for a grille, are enjoyably forthright about how much better 80s films were versus those of the “awful, meta, self-aware” present. And while there isn’t enough unpacking of why they and other musicians are so given to nostalgia, London producer 80s Stallone admits of his passion for the past: “I had more hair – I had a future!”Rise of the Synths screens at Dublin Lighthouse on 14 March, then tours.

The Elephant Man review – David Lynch's tragic tale of compassion,"Four decades on, John Hurt’s performance gives this biopic a poignancy that marks it apart from the rest of director’s work",5,"This beautiful, measured and rather atypical movie by David Lynch from 1980 is now on re-release, written for the screen by Lynch with Christopher De Vore and Eric Bergren. It tells the story of John Merrick, the “Elephant Man”, a Victorian-era person with disfigurements who was rescued from a cruel fairground show by the concerned physician Frederick Treves and established as a fashionable figure in London society, despite nagging fears that Merrick had simply become a grander and more acceptable form of freak attraction.John Hurt, in complex and intricate prosthetics, plays Merrick with an unforgettably distinctive, gentle, quavering voice. Anthony Hopkins is Treves, the muscular Victorian man of science who rescues him; John Gielgud is the stern hospital chief Mr Carr-Gomm who becomes an advocate for Merrick, as does the no-nonsense matron, robustly played by Wendy Hiller. Anne Bancroft plays the stage star Madge Kendal, who takes a kindly interest.The film is different from the stage play of the same name, in which David Bowie played Merrick in 1980-81, as did Bradley Cooper in the recent London revival with a voice clearly inspired by Hurt. The play suggests a daring sexual tension in Kendal’s interest in Merrick, whereas the film imagines extended episodes in which a corrupt hospital porter (played by Michael Elphick) is being paid by pub drinkers to let them come and gawp at the terrified patient. At the time, I remember thinking that Treves’ rescuing of Merrick was like Nicholas Nickleby stepping in to prevent Smike being beaten in the legendary Royal Shakespeare Company stage adaptation in 1979.Lynch’s film was celebrated and spoofed in its time, not least in Richard Curtis’s comedy The Tall Guy, the plot of which featured a gobsmackingly tasteless musical version of The Elephant Man in which Jeff Goldblum took the lead. (Once you realise Lynch’s movie was produced by Mel Brooks, you can’t help thinking about his Young Frankenstein.) Nowadays, the context for its representation of disability has changed and the actor Adam Pearson, who has a similar condition to Merrick’s, has condemned the practice of “cripping up”.It has to be said that Lynch’s Elephant Man, while not exactly sentimental, takes a determinedly un-alienated attitude to Merrick’s image: rational, compassionate and very different from his approach to what might be called body-nonconformity in Eraserhead in which the keynote is clearly one of horror. There is far more empathy in The Elephant Man, especially in the moving scene in which Treves brings Carr-Gomm to see Merrick for the first time – and poor Merrick is at first hardly able to speak and then astonishes both men by reciting the 23rd Psalm from memory. It is always moving later, when Merrick asks Treves: “Can you cure me?” and, on getting a candid reply, says quietly: “I thought not …”Lynch’s depiction of Victorian London is strong, because it is not fetishised or Hollywood-ised in the usual way but simply uses existing city locations (which in 1980 were still a very good match). And Lynch, with his editor Anne V Coates, subverts the usual narrative rhythm by ending a scene on a line or moment that might normally be considered a climactic point – giving the proceedings a persistent dream logic. It is while Merrick is being exhibited on the European tour that Lynch explores the idea of something other than ordinary sympathy for him, showing us him in Tod Browning-esque relationship with other circus folk and approaching a mysterious epiphany about the universe unavailable, perhaps, to other people. The two aspects of this approach may not be entirely resolved, but it is an absorbing and satisfying drama, and Hurt’s Merrick is very powerful. The Elephant Man is in UK cinemas on 13 March."
Fantasy Island review – Blumhouse's schlock horror lacks imagination,The latest film off the mega-studio’s production line is an odd attempt at genre-surfing that ends up well out of its depth,2,"The mysteries pile up in this schlock thriller faster than the bodies did in director Jeff Wadlow’s last film, Truth or Dare. But one question remains unsolved when the credits roll: who on earth is this film for?Based on a hit US TV show from the late 70s, it’s a reimagining that turns a campy fantasy into a darker, hard-to-define mixture of The Cabin in the Woods, Westworld and Lost. It’s a strange beast, never fully committing to jumpy horror, trippy sci-fi or soapy melodrama. Instead, it makes a clumsy attempt to do it all, taking itself far too seriously but with such goofy earnestness that it almost wins you over.The conceit remains roughly the same as in the original series: guests arrive at a tropical island expecting their fantasies to be realised, but at a price they might not be aware of. Pulling the strings is Mr Roarke (Michael Peña), a white-suited, wisdom-spewing enigma whose motivation is a mystery. His latest batch of guests have various issues to work through, from avenging a high-school bully to revisiting a failed romance. As they’re dragged further into the island’s supernatural recesses, they realise something might be afoot.As the latest offering from Blumhouse, the hit-making production company behind Get Out, Split, Happy Death Day and The Invisible Man, you’d be forgiven for expecting more scares. But Wadlow has something bigger in mind, and there’s something to admire in his ambitious agenda that stretches a modest $7m budget to laudable lengths. Yet the scenarios he concocts with co-writers Chris Roach and Jillian Jacobs aren’t quite as juicy as he seems to think they are, and the film unravels as it heads towards its spectacularly ridiculous finale. The ramped-up silliness clashes with the script’s unearned lurches into self-serious drama, with laughable late attempts to turn the film’s chesspiece characters into figures of empathy. It’s a fantasy scenario for no one. Fantasy Island is released in the UK on 6 March."
Onward review – Pixar conjures big-screen adventure with wizard quest story,Chris Pratt and Tom Holland play teenage elves in this standard-issue but entertaining supernatural quest story,3,"Perhaps impatient, as we all are, for the next renaissance or breakthrough for the Pixar/Disney animation studio, commentators are a bit overexcited about this new film. Onward is actually decent entertainment with some sweet moments, although its real novelty may well be the fleeting revelation that one character is gay (a traffic cop called Specter, voiced by Lena Waithe, who talks about her girlfriend’s daughter).The setting is an alternative-reality anytown America where magic exists, along with various fabular creatures, but all of it has long since been superseded by the efficient and ubiquitous magic of technology. Ian (voiced by Tom Holland) and older brother Barley (Chris Pratt) are teenage elves whose dad died when they were young, now being raised by their mom, Laurel (Julia Louis-Dreyfus). On Ian’s 16th birthday, Laurel gives him a present that his late dad had entrusted to her – a wizard’s staff that endows Ian with magical powers which could bring his dad back to life. But a chaotic accident means that they lose the mystic jewel that goes on the top of the staff, and the brothers have to go on a standard-issue supernatural adventure quest to get it back.There’s a fair bit of wit and fun, and some tender moments, although the attitude towards death isn’t nearly as radically powerful as it was in the 2017 Pixar/Disney classic Coco. And, ungracious as it might be to point out, Onward’s simple debt to Harry Potter is a bit obvious sometimes. Still, it is a likable family comedy that finds an easy rhythm without effort. Onward is released in the UK and US on 6 March and in Australia on 2 April."
Calm With Horses review – crime and brutal punishment in rural Ireland,Barry Keoghan and Cosmo Jarvis shine in an unflinching underworld tale with flashes of real poignancy ,3,"The musician and actor Cosmo Jarvis looks eerily like a young Marlon Brando in this brutal gothic-realist drama set in the west of Ireland, directed by feature first-timer Nick Rowland. Adapted by screenwriter Joe Murtagh from a short story by Colin Barrett in his prize-winning collection Young Skins, it’s a lowlife crime drama with a streak of tragedy, despair and irreverent black humour. It’s powerfully and pugnaciously acted, and horses are brought in – as animals often are in social-realist movies – as symbols of redemptive nobility. But I felt that in narrative terms it turned into a cul-de-sac of macho violence.Jarvis plays Douglas, a big and ferocious ex-boxer now employed as an enforcer by a firm of drug dealers. This is the Devers family: Paudi (Ned Dennehy) and his notionally more respectable brother Hector (David Wilmot). A young cousin of the Devers is Dympna (Barry Keoghan) who has brought Douglas into this line of work and it is his semi-official job to mind Douglas, to handle him and to make sure he shows up for whatever grisly task the brothers have set. Right now, Douglas has to beat up an old man who has raped Hector’s teenage niece Charlotte (Hazel Doupe), and he dispenses this punishment with considerable professionalism in an all-but-unwatchable scene. But his bosses aren’t satisfied with the level of pain meted out.Meanwhile, Douglas is experiencing a kind of self-awakening. He has a five-year-old son, Jack (Kiljan Moroney), by former partner Ursula (Niamh Algar); the boy has autism, and Ursula has to pester Douglas for the money to send their son to a special school. As his boy gets older, it dimly dawns on Douglas that he, too, has a condition himself: an inability to control his surges of rage and anxiety. Ursula knows that Jack is helped by sessions of horse-riding and suspects the same might be true for Douglas – which results in a tender and engaging scene. Douglas in his muddled way is trying to be a good dad, though is unsure how this could be achieved.But really, the language of this movie is fear and violence, peppered with some black-comic dialogue riffs between Dympna and Douglas. Perhaps the ending of the film is a little predicable, but a talented and well-directed cast keep this movie motoring along, and Jarvis is a fierce screen presence."
Parasite: Black & White Version review – horror with a shade of Ealing comedy,"Cinephile’s treat or ticket-peddling gimmick? Either way, this monochrome edition puts the masterful satire in a new light",4,"There’s a moment in Terry Zwigoff’s 1994 documentary about Robert Crumb when the cartoonist leans over his teenage son, tweaks the colour on TV so the film he’s watching becomes black and white, and says: “There! Isn’t that better?”Maybe. Audiences might be wary of special black and white presentations of new movies. Bong Joon-ho’s award-winning Parasite is now getting this treatment, which in 2016 was also conferred on Mad Max: Fury Road with a “black and chrome” edition.Is this “luxury arthouse” monochrome experience a genuine way of enhancing or adding to the film? Or merely a snob marketing ploy, gouging repeat box-office business from an existing fanbase on the fallacious assumption that black and white is somehow classier and more artistic than colour? Would anyone for example, dare offer a colourised version of a new black-and-white movie? Roger Deakins shot the Coens’ The Man Who Wasn’t There on colour film stock and then corrected it to black and white. Perhaps it is possible to show that in colour. But would it find favour on the same basis? I remember the old colourisation debate from the 1970s, when my parents’ old black and white TV was incidentally offering a connoisseur’s monochrome presentation of The Wizard Of Oz and also of BBC Two’s Pot Black, with the snooker balls in exquisitely nuanced gunmetal shades.It does have to be said that there is a real fascination in seeing Parasite through the monochrome lens, and it has a certain crystalline beauty – but then it did in colour. It’s invigorating to see this tremendous film again on any basis, in a way that goes some way to restoring the shock of the new. At the Berlin film festival last month, an industry executive asked me if I thought black and white would help Parasite’s CGI effects. After a short pause, she had to break it to me that those fierce colours in the garden were not entirely natural and nobody was falling down the cellar stairs for real.So here we are again, with the cheeky Fagin-style charlatan family – loafer dad (Song Kang-ho), grumpy mum (Chang Hyae-jin), moody teen son (Choi Woo-sik) and smart daughter (Park So-dam) – living in a squalid semi-basement flat and sensing a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get rich. When the son is engaged as a tutor for a rich kid (Jung Ji-so) from a privileged family who live in a colossal modernist house in the posh part of town, he sees how he can get his entire clan employed there too, pretending to be unrelated strangers. The daughter gets to tutor the kid brother (Jung Hyun-jun) in art, the mum ousts the existing housekeeper and the dad takes over the driver’s job. And all the time, the naïve mistress of the house (Cho Yeo-chong) and her overworked husband Mr Park (Lee Syun-kun) get the wool pulled over their eyes, until everyone realises that another terrifying trick is being played on all of them.Bong has said the advantage of black and white is that it allows the performances to come across more strongly. For me, that isn’t quite it. The performances came across quite superbly enough in colour – the monochrome advantages and disadvantages lie elsewhere. In the opening section of the film, seeing the family’s scuzzy and ineffably yucky flat in black-and-white gives it an intriguingly kitchen-sinky, Brit social-realist look that it didn’t have before, especially when the son and daughter hunch together over that nasty lavatory that is raised on to the flat’s chaotic “mezzanine” level. And when the whole place is submerged in smoke from the fumigation official, the resulting fog is hilariously stylised, as if Nosferatu is going to emerge from the mist.And in fact, when all their con-trick shenanigans start to kick off in earnest, the black-and-white Parasite emphasises another Brit dimension that I’d only vaguely sensed from the original: an Ealing comedy.It’s when the action moves to the wealthy household that things become less satisfying. We don’t see the house’s magnificent decor in all its richness and out in the garden, the vivid blue of the sky and rich green of the grass are no longer. When violence erupts, the splashes of blood are less overtly shocking in grey. (But then this is why Scorsese preferred Raging Bull in black and white.)Yet it is too reductive to say that only the “lower-class” parts of Parasite are better in black and white. Monochrome gives something very elegant to the Park family’s illuminated glass crockery cabinets positioned either side of the cellar door, replaced later with wine bottles and glasses. And there is something very queasy and dreamlike in seeing the final bloodbath in black and white. It’s a different sort of queasiness and dreaminess than the colour version … but not necessarily better.There is something very startling about this specialist monochrome-flavour version of Parasite. It gave me a renewed appetite to watch the film all over again. In colour.Parasite: Black & White Version screens on 5 March at the Glasgow film festival, and is released in the UK on 3 April"
All the Bright Places review – teen charm can't lift maudlin Netflix drama,"Elle Fanning and Justice Smith make for a likable pair in a YA romance that tries, uneasily, to cover issues of suicide, mental illness and grief",2,"One of the many life lessons preached by the well-intentioned, if ultimately ill-advised, young adult (YA) adaptation All the Bright Places is that even in the darkness, light is waiting. The lead teens, played of course by twentysomethings, have experienced some form of trauma in their past, and together they try to find meaning and hope in all the messiness. It’s something director Brett Haley tries as well, with the film that surrounds them layering issues of grief, suicide and mental illness while also trying to invest us in a cutesy romance. It’s a delicate balance, especially for a film aimed at a young, sensitive audience, and it’s not one Haley ever manages to perfect, struggling to let Jennifer Niven’s acclaimed source material breathe on its own, erring from twee to maudlin so fast it gives us whiplash.In the first act, though, there’s a concept that I found rather intriguing. The film starts with Violet Markey (Elle Fanning) standing on the edge of a bridge, contemplating the fall, interrupted by Theodore Finch (Justice Smith). Her sister died in a car accident the year before, and she has been trapped in an emotional malaise ever since, unable to re-enter the world. Finch, an outsider at school labelled a freak by his peers, takes an impassioned interest in her, insisting they work on a school project together despite her reluctance. The project needs them to travel to different sites around the state of Indiana, and Finch takes it upon himself to engineer this, enthusiastically inserting himself in her life.Now, his behaviour is familiar to anyone with even a cursory knowledge of romantic comedies. He’s a cross between a Manic Pixie Dream Boy and what’s been more commonly viewed as a glorified stalker by critics who have started to revisit what we’ve grown to accept as normal in Hollywood’s idea of courting. Men who relentlessly pursue women until they eventually grow weary and give in have populated so many of the romcoms we hold dear, and what’s smart about the plotting here is that once the tweeness subsides, we start to learn the truth about Finch. Hiding behind these romantic gestures is someone with an unsteady grasp of his mental health. In the book it’s described as undiagnosed bipolar disorder, something the film never fully explains, and it provides an interesting flip side to behaviour that has been otherwise romanticised on screen.It’s a genuinely interesting idea, but it can only invest us so much in a film that feels often frustratingly aimless. Haley, who last directed the sweet and underseen Hearts Beat Loud, gives the film a stronger aesthetic than most Netflix teen offerings, and Fanning and Smith work hard at charming us into submission, but their hard-to-buy relationship isn’t quite the immersive ride-or-die love connection it needs to be, given the melodrama of the last act. Fans of the book will know where the film is headed: on screen it’s a development that’s handled abruptly and in a worryingly romanticised manner that borders on irresponsible. It’s hard to explain my specific problems without spoiling the plot, but an event takes place that edges the film into risky territory and that aforementioned mixture of darkness and light suddenly becomes distractingly unbalanced. Embedding heavier, more substantive, issues in content aimed at a teenage audience can have a profound and positive impact, but mishandling them can be something close to damaging and the lofty ambitions here aren’t supported by the requisite sensitivity.All the Bright Places is a handsomely packaged film that a considerable portion of Netflix’s younger audience might well gravitate towards and, learning from previous mistakes, there’s messaging inserted near the start of the end credits for those who might be affected by the themes raised. But it doesn’t negate what comes before it: a film that lingers briefly in the deep end but remains disappointingly shallow.All the Bright Places is now available on Netflix"
Dark Waters review – Todd Haynes plumbs the depths of a poisoning scandal,"In this gripping real-life thriller, Mark Ruffalo plays a lawyer who takes on the company that dumped toxic chemicals in West Virginia for decades",4,"Todd Haynes is such a distinctive authorial voice in American cinema, a genius from left field, notably addressing identity and sexuality, and with an interest in fantasy, pastiche and the vicissitudes of period detail. Dark Waters is in so many ways out of character for him: a straight-ahead, true-life legal thriller, fluently adapted by screenwriters Mario Correa and Matthew Michael Carnahan from a New York Times magazine article by Nathaniel Rich.It plays out in the absorbing classic style, featuring the principled lawyer (played here by Mark Ruffalo) taking on the corporate bad guys on behalf of ordinary folks. There are no ironically self-aware stylistic touches, although – given that it is a film about bad things being hidden in the waters – the first scene with young people rashly swimming in a poisoned creek could allude to the opening of Jaws.Rob Bilott (Ruffalo) is the besuited corporate lawyer from Ohio who has built a blandly prosperous career in the 1990s representing big, powerful companies. But then an angry West Virginia farmer called Wilbur Tennant (ferociously played by Bill Camp) gets in touch, because he is a friend and neighbour of Bilott’s grandma. (In real life, Tennant just called Bilott on the phone; the movie has him show up embarrassingly in the office in his dusty farmer’s gear.) All of Wilbur’s cows are being horribly poisoned because of chemical firm DuPont’s nearby plant. Something truly evil is going on.This is a moment of destiny. Because an unhappy farmer knew his grandmother, and showed him the truth about how corporations were treating innocent people, Bilott switched sides, to the initial horror of his colleagues and discomfiture of his family and wife Sarah (Anne Hathaway). The film shows that he was turned, or flipped, like a spy – using his knowledge of the big chemical firms against them.Legal dramas such as Erin Brockovich and Richard Jewell generally present a rather quaintly imagined ordinary person, with all his or her blue-collar flaws, taking on the fat-cat establishment with the help of an overworked maverick lawyer. This isn’t quite how Dark Waters plays out: Camp’s farmer is the ordinary person, right enough, but the limelight settles on Ruffalo’s lawyer, who is the real everyman – slumped, with bad posture, a permanent grimace on his lower lip and a stress-induced tremor in his hand.In some ways, the movie is closer to something like Michael Mann’s The Insider (1999) about taking on big tobacco. It’s a procedural, and all the fascination is in the detail: the mounds of documents, the boardroom discussions, the cunning courtroom strategies and the heroic jiu-jitsu of using a corporation’s massive institutional weight against it. Dark Waters is a movie that works marvellously well within its own generic terms, and perhaps after the fey disappointment of Todd Haynes’s previous, rather insufferable fantasy Wonderstruck, this tough, clear movie was what Haynes needed to clear his creative palate. Dark Waters is released in the UK on 28 February and in Australia on 5 March."
Color Out of Space review – Nicolas Cage goes cosmic in freaky sci-fi horror,"A repulsive alien organism is unleashed on Earth in Richard Stanley’s scary, hokey – and often funny – extravaganza ",3,"In the bonkers 2018 thriller Mandy, Nicolas Cage gave one of his Cage-iest performances yet, face splattered in blood as he pursued a cult leader who’d tortured his girlfriend. If you thought that was trippy, wait till you see Color Out of Space, in which Cage’s mug is once again sprayed with blood ... alpaca blood.Adapted from a story by HP Lovecraft, this is a freaky-deaky, retro-cosmic science-fiction horror about a meteor that slams into Earth unleashing an extraterrestrial organism. The whole thing looks as if it was dreamed up under the influence of a quality batch of LSD. I laughed out loud at the hokiest bits. But I’ve got to admit I was sucked in and genuinely scared, too.The director is Richard Stanley, who hasn’t made a feature film since he got fired from The Island of Dr Moreau (1996). Cage plays Nathan Gardner, an artist who moves with his wife (Joely Richardson) and three kids back to the farm where he grew up, to raise alpacas. In a very Cage-y moment he turns dreamy-eyed while milking: “You’ve got to warm the boob.”When a meteor lands in their front garden, the family witness flashes of a colour never before seen by the human eye (actually, purple). After the meteor comes the terror. Lush mutant flowers begin to grow in the garden; the dog won’t stop whimpering; everyone gets a bit shouty. Then things get gobsmackingly, gaggingly repulsive.To be fair, Cage holds it in for the first hour, giving us his version of liberal, caring dad. When he does finally does let rip, he doesn’t go all-out ragey-Cagey, but does something creepier: rambling in a Trumpishly high-pitched, peevish voice. It’s a film with a fair few ludicrously funny bits, yet something endearing in how unashamedly earnestly it’s played straight, not for laughs.Love it or loathe it, Stanley is trying to do something distinctively his own after all those years in the cold. His movie perhaps has the makings of a cult classic. Color Out of Space is released in the UK on 28 February."
DAU. Natasha review – an exquisitely sinister study of Soviet oppression,"As part of a colossal art project, Ilya Khrzhanovsky has made an intimately eerie examination of the banality of evil",5,"On its own terms, DAU. Natasha is a brutally queasy and stark picture of the life of a fictional woman who works in the staff canteen of a Stalin-era scientific research institute in Moscow, headed by theoretical physicist Lev Landau (nicknamed “Dau”). It shows us her quarrelsome relationship with her younger assistant Olga, who waits on tables while Natasha serves at the till. Eventually, the film gives us a look inside Room 101, with all its terror and squalor.However, the film cannot simply be judged on its own terms, but as part of a gigantic (but mostly unseen and perhaps unseeable) whole: a colossal multimedia art installation project 15 years in the making that has become legend. Not least, this is because of its weird similarity to the folie de grandeur envisaged by the fictional theatre director in Charlie Kaufman’s 2008 film Synecdoche, New York, who proposed an entire city block full of actors improvising “real” lives on a 24/7 basis for months and years until the director thinks the resulting dramas are ready to be shown to an audience. This film originated as a conventional biopic of Landau begun in 2006, but which director Ilya Khrzhanovsky repurposed by taking the part-replica of the Moscow institute, built already in Ukraine for location shooting purposes, and then finishing every room inside as an absolutely accurate clone of the research institute. It was filled with hundreds of actors who lived and “worked” in an ongoing improvisation there for months, cut off from the internet and the outside world, before shooting could begin, showing the many stories generated within this artificial universe. So far, 13 films have emerged from the Dau project, 12 of which were shown last year at an immersive Dau exhibition in Paris. This is the first of the Dau franchise to be shown in conventional theatrical terms.Natalia Berezhnaya plays Natasha, who serves impassively wearing the black uniform and mob cap that might remind you of someone working at a British railway station in the Brief Encounter era. When the customers have all gone home, she gossips and bickers tensely with young Olga (Olga Shkabaryna), who is too lazy to help clean up and mocks Natasha for a life wasted in the affair she has been having with a married man. (Ambiguously, both women appear to have had sexual episodes with the institute’s director.) One evening, Natasha and Olga get roaring drunk with all the scientists and apparatchiks who have come in to celebrate a sinister experiment in radiation conducted by Luc (Luc Bigé), who goes to bed with Natasha. And then, with a sickening inevitability, Natasha is pulled in for questioning by the security services, in the form of hatchet-faced officer Azhippo (Vladimir Azhippo).What DAU. Natasha shows is the bizarre way that, in totalitarian societies, the normal and the abnormal, the banal and the grotesque, and the human and the inhuman live together side by side. Again, the Orwellian word “doublethink” occurred to me while watching this, along of course with the fabled room of horror. While Olga and Natasha are doing their dull jobs in the cafe, Luc and his colleagues are doing bizarre, occult radiation experiments nearby with naked men in a triangular based pyramid. And after the resulting celebratory bacchanal, Natasha is careful to maintain a kind of devil-may-care good humour, but Berezhnaya devastatingly shows us her solitary, hungover descent into despair and depression, which was always there under the surface. Then, as if to mock her (and our) conviction that things could hardly get worse, she is told to report for questioning in an interrogation cell.The conversation with Azhippo that precedes this, and which intermittently continues throughout, is terrifyingly ambiguous. Partly it is a kind of misogynist exercise in punishment: Natasha’s presumption in having an escapade with a visiting and prestigious foreign official must be viciously corrected. But perhaps it is more that she is to be recruited into spying on Luc and his international comrades – and this exercise in fear, this boot grinding into Natasha’s face, is a way of frightening her into line. Azhippo repeatedly asks if he and Natasha are going to be “friends”, and it isn’t simply sadism. They might need a cordial working relationship: she and Azhippo coexist in a grisly Stockholm syndrome, like the one that unites the people and the Stalinist state. It is a strange high-functioning kind of despair. An eerie, intimately disturbing film. DAU. Natasha is available on dau.com from 24 April."
Midnight Family review – superb documentary on Mexico’s private ambulances,"There’s a twilight zone that the Ochoa family, the subjects of this superb observational documentary, inhabit. It’s a very dirty grey area situated somewhere between moral and amoral, occasionally dipping into outright immoral. The Ochoa men (and only once do we get a glimpse of one of the women of the family) save lives. Which, in any normal world, would make them the good guys. But the Ochoas live in Mexico City, in which there are just 45 government ambulances to support a population of around 9 million.",4,"Mopping up the overspill is an unofficial network of private ambulances, for-profit services that ferociously compete to pick up the victims of accidents and then charge them – or at least attempt to charge them – for emergency care. The Ochoas run one such ambulance; Luke Lorentzen’s remarkable film rides along inside a vehicle that supports an extended family financially and provides a lifeline for the injured and sick. It also serves as a mobile childcare unit for the younger Ochoa boy, who prefers the outlaw thrill of prowling the streets at night to the grind of the school day. And who can blame him? Captured by a camera that frequently rattles against the sides of the hurtling ambulance, the Ochoas’ night-time escapades are electrifying and urgent, doused in strobing emergency lights and powered by adrenaline.As the film unfolds, however, it becomes clear that the Ochoas are in the business of what looks increasingly like extortion, albeit extortion wearing a caring face. With the cops strong-arming the family for bribes and the private hospitals paying out for each patient brought in, nobody comes out of the situation well. But the patients, given a stark choice between bleeding out and being bled dry, are inevitably the losers."
Streaming: where to find Joan Didion gems,The US writer’s acerbic crispness is ill-served by a new adaptation of her 90s thriller The Last Thing He Wanted – but other Didion works are just waiting to be streamed…,0,"The Guardian’s product and service reviews are independent and are in no way influenced by any advertiser or commercial initiative. We will earn a commission from the retailer if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more.There are certain novels that get widely branded by critics as “unfilmable” – usually only after someone has gone to the trouble of trying to film them. The term is rarely justified: even the most abstract and abstruse prose can translate to the screen with enough interpretive bravado and rich visual imagination. (Consider Jonathan Glazer’s startling reinvention of Michel Faber’s Under the Skin or David Cronenberg’s thrilling, deranged take on William S Burroughs’s Naked Lunch as examples that beat the odds.) Still, it is more often attached to films that can fairly be regarded as failures, and it’s with a heavy heart that I add Dee Rees’s perplexing new adaptation of Joan Didion’s The Last Thing He Wanted to that list.The Guardian’s product and service reviews are independent and are in no way influenced by any advertiser or commercial initiative.

Seemingly lost in the maze of Didion’s densely plotted 1996 thriller – about a morally upright Washington journalist (played with earnest commitment by Anne Hathaway) stumbling upon far-flung skulduggery as she covers the 1984 general election – it’s murky and overwritten, lacking the stylistic conviction of Rees’s earlier films Pariah and Mudbound. Head over to Netflix if you’re curious – a curiosity it certainly is – but the streaming giant’s best offering for the author’s devotees remains her nephew Griffin Dunne’s literate, intimate documentary Joan Didion: The Center Will Not Hold.Rees’s film did get me thinking, however, about Didion’s odd relationship to Hollywood, both as an adaptation source and as a screenwriter herself. For one reason or another, the tart, sometimes acerbic crispness of her writing has rarely connected with audiences in film form, though not for the lack of interesting attempts. The letdown of The Last Thing He Wanted prompted me to visit the only previous full-fledged film of a Didion novel, 1972’s fascinating Play It As It Lays: a long-buried work that is seldom screened and remains unavailable either on physical media or formal streaming outlets.It can be viewed, however, via the Internet Archive, and it’s far more vital and rewarding than its interment might suggest. Centred on an unhappily married Hollywood actress adrift in a glittery fog of showbiz parties and hotel-room liaisons, Didion’s desolately moving study of depressive nihilism might well have been labelled “unfilmable” back in the day. Its fragmented, inward-looking structure of downbeat vignettes could have made for a real mess in the hands of a screenwriter less invested than, well, Didion – who, with her husband, John Gregory Dunne, fashioned it into a screenplay of matchingly modernist, angular architecture. It’s also anchored by a performance of piercing, gradually de-varnished sadness by the ever-undervalued Tuesday Weld. The whole is chilly and alienating, which hasn’t helped its reputation, but aptly so for a character study of a woman who, in her words, “knows what nothing means, and keeps playing”. It deserves a proper small-screen platform.It’s a richer study of showbiz rot than one of Didion and Dunne’s other screenwriting efforts, 1976’s Barbra Streisand-starring A Star Is Born (on Amazon) – the most hedonistic but least affecting version of the oft-filmed chestnut – or 1996’s marshmallowy newscaster romance Up Close and Personal (on YouTube), which is enjoyable enough for the sheer starry glow of Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert Redford. But a forensic Swat team would struggle to turn up any traces of Didion’s voice in the whole thing, complete with its Celine Dion closing-credits ballad.Things get a bit spikier with True Confessions (on iTunes), a sleek 1981 noir based on Dunne’s novel and inspired by the Black Dahlia case, though The Panic in Needle Park (on Chili) is coloured a little more by Didion’s typical blend of romanticism and irony. A 1971 love story between two heroin addicts (Al Pacino and Kitty Winn, desperately lovely together) in grimiest Manhattan, it maintains a slender thread of hope in its downward spiral. Like Play It As It Lays, it’s a reminder that Didion had a more cinematic imagination than she often gets credit for.Honeyland(Dogwoof, 12)Deservedly nominated for foreign-language and documentary Oscars this year, this ravishingly shot study of a middle-aged beekeeper surviving sudden competition in the Macedonian hills is alive with ecological and sociological insight.Roma(Sony, 15)It’s rare for a Netflix film to get a glossy Blu-ray release, let alone the full Criterion Collection treatment, but Alfonso Cuarón’s intricately observed Mexico City memory isn’t any old Netflix film. An essential package for its admirers.The Peanut Butter Falcon(Signature, 12)This sweetly unassuming American indie didn’t do much business in cinemas, but has grown into a word-of-mouth audience favourite. Its modern-day Mark Twain-style adventure of a young man with Down’s Syndrome’s pursuit of freedom stays the right side of sentimental.High Life(Mubi, 18)One of last year’s most skin-prickling films, Claire Denis’s radical, sensually charged foray into science fiction lands on Mubi’s streaming menu tomorrow: take the challenge."
"Warhol by Blake Gopnik review – sex, religion and overtaking Picasso","A splendid life of Andy Warhol claims him as the most influential artist of the 20th century, and isn’t shy of exposing his private life",0,"There are so many Warholian moments in this superb biography that it’s hard to know where to start. There is the time someone turned up to a party at the Factory dressed as a box of Brillo. Or the great man’s habit of answering a routine “How are you?” with a whispery “I’m OK but I have diarrhoea.” Or the social nightmare of being invited round to watch the unwatchable Sleep, a home movie consisting of five hours of a naked man snoozing. How to get through the ordeal without dropping off and starting to dribble on Andy’s shoulder? (Actually, this would never have happened – Warhol hated such physical contact and was capable of throwing out any guest who overstepped the mark.)It is a testimony to Blake Gopnik’s skill that he is able to acknowledge how silly these provocations sound while simultaneously insisting on their enduring art historical significance. Dressing up as a box of Brillo may count as a stunt, but Gopnik, a veteran critic and contributor to the New York Times, sees it as the logical extension of Marcel Duchamp’s gesture 50 years earlier when he exhibited a porcelain pissoir as art. Responding to someone’s standard greeting with a detailed report on your bowel movements may be childish but it also pointedly disrupts the genteel discourse of a rapidly capitalising art market. The fact that today we are inclined to roll our eyes at such anecdotes is evidence not of Warhol’s nullity, but of his continuing ubiquity. Whether we like it or not, we are still living in his world. This spring’s Warhol exhibition at Tate Modern is one of the most eagerly awaited of recent years.All the same, it would be wrong to imply that Gopnik’s book is one that Warhol might have written himself or, indeed, even liked very much. Far from being a ready-made, assembled from the detritus of the scholarly-industrial complex, Warhol: A Life As Art is the product of years studying 100,000 or so original documents housed in Pittsburgh’s Andy Warhol Museum. The artist was a lifelong hoarder, and Gopnik’s research is intricately based on a florid haul of engagement diaries, business letters, love notes, theatre tickets and tax returns. To help the reader keep their bearings through nearly 1,000 pages, each chapter starts with a handy precis along the lines of “Classmates and teachers”; “A dose of failure”; “Window dressing”. It is a charmingly old-fashioned touch.Perhaps Gopnik feels the need to supply these handholds because of the vertiginous nature of the claims he is about to make. The first, and most audacious, is that Warhol has “overtaken Picasso as the most important and influential artist of the 20th century”, even ascending to a spot on “the top peak of Parnassus, beside Michelangelo and Rembrandt”. This is big talk, but Gopnik persuasively assembles his case over the course of this mesmerising book, which is as much art history and philosophy as it is biography. For instance, rather than get caught up in the stale debate about whether Warhol’s silk-screens of Marilyn, Jackie and Mao were art, design, pop, mechanical reproduction or simply a bad joke, Gopnik argues that they serve to demolish the very terms on which such a discussion rests. “At his best, Warhol didn’t think outside the box,” he insists; “he thought outside any artistic universe whose laws would allow boxes to exist … Warhol always wanted to make work for a world where X and not-X would be true at the same time.”Gopnik is also keen to dislodge the many canards about Warhol’s private life. The most adhesive of these is the one about him surrounding himself with every kind of kink and freak while remaining fastidiously hors de sexual combat. Gopnik carefully rummages through the laundry basket to reveal plenty of evidence that Warhol was an enthusiastic player in the NYC gay scene from the moment he first stepped off the Greyhound bus from Pittsburgh in 1949. What’s more, despite his self-consciousness about his patchy skin and baldness, there’s plenty of photographic and anecdotal evidence that Warhol had a gym-honed body with particularly good legs, and plenty of body hair. If we are determined to continue seeing Our Andy as fey and de-natured, Gopnik suggests, then it says more about our lingering homophobia that cannot bear to contemplate an artistic genius “caught in the act with men”.The other myth he is keen to stamp on is the one about Warhol being deeply devout. While in his later years he took to popping in to the fabulously turreted St Vincent Ferrer on the Upper East Side, Warhol treated religion just as he treated everything else, which is to say entirely on his own terms. He avoided mass because it went on too long – five minutes, he opined, was quite enough for anyone – and shunned confession because he was convinced the priests would recognise him through the grille and gossip about his sins (and potentially disappoint him, perhaps, if they didn’t). He liked the clothes, the buildings and the props, and was not above splashing holy water around at home “as a kind of heavenly disinfectant”, but he left it to his mother, who was also his housemate, to keep the Warhola clan in good standing with their Rusyn-Carpathian God.And then there’s the soup. “Almost every recollection of Warhol’s early days comes clogged with soup cans,” notes Gopnik wearily, and then proceeds to kick them away one by one. It is simply not true that Andy fell in love with the red and white Campbell’s tin in his early childhood, and then clung on to it for dear life as a highly charged transitional object with which to negotiate the perils of adult life. In Depression-era Pittsburgh, no one was flush enough to buy ready-mades for the table. Instead, Julia Warhola mushed together some water, salt, pepper and ketchup (the latter was allowed because it was Heinz, and Heinz owned Pittsburgh) into an approximation of something from the old country. Even once Andy’s career was taking off in New York, Mrs Warhola was still offering visitors chicken soup cooked from scratch, rather than poured from a tin.The real origin story of Warhol’s encounter with Campbell’s soup will never be known. Various old-timers claim that they were the ones who first called Andy’s attention to the potential of the red and cream label with its folksy cursive font, even supplying him with the ur-can, the one from which all the others derive. But what really matters is not where Warhol got the soup, but what he was trying to do with it. The answer turns out to be nothing less than the destruction of painting’s then current dominant mode, abstract expressionism, which had held sway since the second world war. He knew he couldn’t drip like de Kooning or drop like Pollock and so, drawing on his decade as a commercial illustrator, he set about the radical business of returning subject matter to art.It is hard now to recapture the shock of 1962 when the iterations of Campbell’s soup went on display at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles (New York wasn’t interested). But the cumulative effect of their pristine forms, their tromp l’oeil construction, their obsessive reiteration (there were 32 prints, one for each flavour), luminous banality and, above all, their thereness, was to blast apart everything that we thought – and think – we know about art.

Mogul Mowgli review – Riz Ahmed tackles British selfhood head on,"Profound drama about culture, family and what it means to represent a community",3,"Riz Ahmed brings his intense and always engaging presence to this film as star, co-producer and co-writer with its director, Bassam Tariq. It is a deeply personal drama about culture, family, community and what it means to represent – though it can also be self-indulgent and even a bit self-involved, though this is arguably a function of the story.Ahmed plays a British-Pakistani rapper, Zed, who has become a huge hit in New York, is preparing for a US tour and is clearly on the verge of the big time (Ahmed’s own rapping is also impressive). Zed’s girlfriend suggests he uses the time before the tour stars to reconnect with his family in Wembley, London, whom he hasn’t seen in two years, especially his hardworking mum and dad (strong performances from Sudha Bhuchar and Alyy Khan).But things are tense when he returns, with unspoken reproaches from his parents about being away, and there are murmurings from his home town friends about Zed being a sellout and a “coconut”. And then through a nauseous twist of fate – some terrible, inexplicable judgment from the heavens – Zed is admitted to hospital with a muscle-wasting autoimmune disease that means he may have to abandon his place on the tour and give it to hated rival rapper Majid (Nabhaan Rizwan) – even letting him perform some of his material.As he undergoes painful treatment, Zed starts to hallucinate about his personal history and his place in Britain and Pakistan’s history: a strange masked figure relates the mythic tale of Toba Tek Singh, the area ripped apart by the 1947 partition. Zed’s ordeal is made even more anguished by the Faustian bargain presented by the hospital doctors: the only therapy possible involves the risk of infertility.On one level, Mogul Mowgli could be read as a black-comic fable about the overwhelming importance of never going home and never getting bogged down in that boring place you’ve worked so hard to get away from. That background is fine to write powerful lyrics about and generally bolster your star status in the US. But the moment you go back there, the muscle-wasting disease will kick in.Of course, it is nothing so cynical. Zed feels deeply about the place he came from – a complicated nexus of determinant backgrounds. And he feels strongly about his work as an artist, although here, too, there is a question of appropriating other cultures’ art forms. There is an imaginary rap battle with a British-African performer. It is performed with forthright sincerity and it tackles the complexities of 21st-century British selfhood head on. Mogul Mowgli is in cinemas from 30 October. Near the Jugular, a season of films chosen by Bassam Tariq and Riz Ahmed is running at BFI Southbank and on BFI Player until 30 November."
Spycies review – not so perfect spies,Naive animation and a clumsy ecological message mar this feature starring a spy cat and hacker rat,1,"This simplistic animated feature produced by the Chinese streaming platform iQiyi centres on top-tier spy cat Vladimir (Kirk Thornton), who finds himself demoted to security detail and forced into a job share with a hacker rat named Hector (Dino Andrade). Hector is obsessed with a TV soap starring a glamorous, leggy bee. Radioactive material is stolen from their lab and so they must retrieve it by breaking into a hospital.Teahouses and fire-breathing dragons hint at this Chinese-French co-production’s setting, but the action lacks a sense of place. There’s a dynamic, human edge to the skilfully drawn characters that is sadly missing from the inanimate dialogue, “humour” and voice work. The film’s well-meaning message about conserving endangered species is clumsily deployed too. “Our mission is to make sure all races survive,” assures an altruistic brown bear, fundamentally confusing race with species."
Emma review – Austen's sweet satire gets a multiplex makeover,"Autumn de Wilde’s adaptation ramps up the comedy, but Anya Taylor-Joy remains wonderfully edgy as Jane Austen’s meddling heroine",3,"With its heady mix of social satire, romantic intrigue and endlessly reinterpretable gender politics, Jane Austen’s 1815 novel Emma has long proved catnip for film-makers. The 2009 TV miniseries starring Romola Garai followed a string of small-screen productions, dating back to such offerings as a 1948 BBC “telefilm” with Judy Campbell. Recent big-screen adaptations have ranged from Douglas McGrath’s 1996 hit featuring Gwyneth Paltrow (for which composer Rachel Portman won an Oscar) to the 2010 Hindi-language romcom Aisha with Sonam Kapoor. For many, however, Amy Heckerling’s 1995 “queen bee” treat Clueless remains a favourite, astutely transposing the British riffs of Austen’s source to the modern milieu of an American high school.This latest colourful incarnation boasts the remarkable Anya Taylor-Joy as Austen’s “handsome, clever and rich” heroine Emma Woodhouse, spoilt daughter of a doting widowed father, who has lived nearly 21 years “with very little to distress or vex her”. With no responsibility beyond the care of her draught-obsessed papa (a mournful Bill Nighy, dressed to accentuate his pipe-cleaner limbs), Emma entertains herself by match-making, presumptuously manipulating the relationships of those around her.When the comparatively lowly Harriet (played by Mia Goth with an infantile innocence that extends from saucer-wide eyes to a gambolling playground gait) falls into Miss Woodhouse’s circle, Emma rudely diverts her from the course of true love. Instead, she sets her sights on the clearly unattainable – and entirely inappropriate – Mr Elton (Josh O’Connor, oozing insufferable divinity). Meanwhile, neighbouring friend-in-law Mr Knightley (Johnny Flynn, combining vulnerability with a weapons-grade animal magnetism notably absent from Austen’s novel) circles Emma with an air of both adoration and exasperation, lamenting her casual cruelty while secretly admiring her wit and beauty.Directed by rock photographer and music-video veteran Autumn de Wilde, from a script by Man Booker prize winner Eleanor Catton, this latest Emma. (self-consciously styled in the title with a full stop) takes flirtatious liberties with Austen, to often hilarious effect. There’s a strong element of screwball comedy at play (De Wilde cites Bringing Up Baby as an inspiration alongside John Hughes’s coming-of-age movies), an approach that pays crowd-pleasing dividends, even as it reduces the complexities of the original text to a rather more caricatured screen romp.Having introduced Mr Knightley galloping gamely on a steed before watching him strip naked, De Wilde employs a mirrored bum-flashing motif that playfully suggests fleshy passions in her otherwise politely distanced leads. Later, the sturdy cinematic spectacle of dance doesn’t so much whisper what is left unsaid by the dialogue as scream it, ensuring that cinema audiences know exactly what’s going on, even as readers are still figuring it out. Elsewhere, scenes of near-slapstick mastication rub shoulders with moments in which existential unease mutates into something closer to sitcom-style silliness – flimsy, but great fun.Musically, Emma. juxtaposes folk tunes with operatic voices as the action traverses social boundaries, with composers Isobel Waller-Bridge and David Schweitzer linking characters to instruments (a harp for Emma, a bassoon for Mr Knightley) in their cues. Live performances play a key role, too, from the piano duelling of Emma and Jane Fairfax (the multitalented Amber Anderson) to a duet in which Knightley sings and plays violin while Emma seethes silently from a distance.The impressive ensemble cast includes Miranda Hart, who gets the balance between pathos and pratfalls just right as the loquacious but unjustly wounded Miss Bates. As the abrasive Mrs Elton, Tanya Reynolds deploys a raised chin and the merest hint of a sneer to excellent effect, while Callum Turner’s Frank Churchill is the cad incarnate.In the lead role, Anya Taylor-Joy creates an admirably spiky character who is less likable than some of her screen predecessors, and all the better for it. There’s a touch of Liza Minnelli in the juxtaposition of Taylor-Joy’s angular face and window-to-the-soul eyes, something that enables her to telegraph contradictory emotions with apparent ease – a silent-movie quality perfectly suited to this role.As production designer, Kave Quinn conjures a lavish environment in which the possibility of treading mud into cloistered enclaves remains a perceived threat, and costume designer Alexandra Byrne dresses the cast in a series of intrusively high collars that appear to offer everyone’s head on a platter – a neat visual metaphor for Austen’s guillotine-sharp social satire. The film may blunt some of the edges of that satire for the multiplex market, but it’s still in there, continuing to inspire new adaptations of what remains a timeless text."
Sonic the Hedgehog review – running to a standstill,This hastily ‘improved’ adaptation of the Sega video game classic still lacks spine,2,"All publicity is not good publicity, as the team behind the live-action Sonic the Hedgehog discovered when the film’s trailer was released in April 2019. Fans of the 1991 Sega video game were disturbed by the animated blue hedgehog’s uncanny human proportions, and so the project was delayed six months in order to “fix” the problem. The freshly redesigned Sonic, voiced by Parks and Recreation’s Ben Schwartz, is certainly cuter than his previous iteration, squat and cheeky next to James Marsden’s sleepy, Hollywood-handsome sheriff. Yet as in the case of Tom Hooper’s hastily smoothed-out Cats, the improved visual effects do little to enhance the two-dimensional storytelling.An over-explained and all-too-brief prologue sets up Sonic as an orphaned loner whose powers of super-speed have forced him into exile on Earth. I’d have liked to have seen more of Sonic’s video game inspired-world; instead, the action is grounded in Green Hills, Montana, where Marsden’s Tom Wachowski becomes Sonic’s first real friend, keeping him from the sticky clutches of goofy drone-lord Dr Robotnik (Jim Carrey, underwritten and overdoing it). Marsden is charming enough, summoning surprising chemistry with Schwartz, and so it’s not total torture spending an hour and a half with the pair. Yet for better or worse, it doesn’t linger."
First Love review – a bloody slice of Tokyo pulp fiction,Director Takashi Miike plays to his strengths in a flamboyantly violent boy-meets-girl crime caper,4,"Less than three minutes into Takashi Miike’s First Love, a severed head rolls into an alleyway, eyes wide open and blinking in shock. Eye-popping is one way to describe the prolific Japanese director’s 103rd film, a cheerfully pulpy Tokyo-set noir.Leo (Masataka Kubota) is a boxer, hunkily brooding and ambivalent in an Alain Delon in Rocco and His Brothers kind of way (or maybe, with his red jacket, James Dean in Rebel Without a Cause). He has unfulfilled potential, with little to live for – until he runs headfirst into damsel in distress Yuri, aka Monica (Sakurako Konishi), an addict and sex worker on the run from the mob.On their tail is the enraged girlfriend of Yuri’s now-dead pimp (Becky Rabone, in a gleeful and deranged riff on the gangster’s moll), as well as a comical, coked-up yakuza named Kase (Shōta Sometani). There’s also the ghost of Yuri’s abusive father, who appears at inopportune moments wrapped in a large white sheet.Kôji Endô’s thundering jazz-rock score amplifies Miike’s tendency towards playful cartoon excess. A seemingly benign mechanical puppy triggers an explosion. In another adrenaline-fuelled scene, the action literally explodes into an anime sequence in homage to the elderly Japanese stuntmen whose blockbuster car chases Miike was inspired by. These tonal swerves temper some of the more flamboyant violence."
Parasite review – a gasp-inducing masterpiece,"In Bong Joon-ho’s flawless tragicomedy, a poor yet united family bluff their way into the lives of a wealthy Seoul household",5,"The ideal way to experience South Korean auteur Bong Joon-ho’s awards-garlanded, international box-office smash is with as little prior knowledge as possible. So if you’re reading this before seeing the film, and you’ve managed to avoid the whirlwind of publicity it has attracted since winning the Palme d’Or last May, it may be simpler to just stop and head straight to the cinema. Because, at the risk of adding to the hype, Parasite really is the kind of remarkable experience that makes modern movie-going such a joy. I saw it for the fourth time last week and I’m now desperate to view the black-and-white version that Bong recently unveiled at the Rotterdam film festival.Described by its creator as “a comedy without clowns, a tragedy without villains”, Parasite is more Shakespearean than Hitchockian – a tale of two families from opposite ends of the socioeconomic spectrum, told with the trademark genre-fluidity that has seen Bong’s back catalogue slip seamlessly from murder mystery, via monster movie, to dystopian future-fantasy and beyond. We first meet the Kim family, headed by father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) and mother Chung-sook (Chang Hyae-jin), in their lowly semi-basement home, hunting for stray wifi coverage and leaving their windows open to benefit from bug-killing street fumigation. They have nothing but one another and a shared sense of hard-scrabble entrepreneurism. So when son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) is faced with an unexpected opportunity to home-tutor a rich schoolgirl, he gets his gifted artist sister, Ki-jung (Park So-dam), to forge a college certificate, bluffing his way into the job and into the home of the Park family.An architectural wonder perched high above the slums of Seoul, with views not of urinating drunks but of luxurious lawns and starlit skies, this wealthy house is everything the Kims’ pokey dwelling is not: elegant, angular and weirdly isolated. While aloof businessman Mr Park (Lee Sun-kyun) is at work, his anxious, uptight wife, Yeon-kyo (Cho Yeo-jeong), tends to their coquettish daughter and hyperactive young son. It’s a lifestyle that relies upon hired help: tutors, a chauffeur and, most importantly, a devoted housekeeper Moon-gwang (Lee Jung-eun), who stayed with the building after its original architect owner moved out. Spying an opening, Ki-woo (newly dubbed “Kevin”) realises that his own family could easily fill such roles, and hatches a plan that will inveigle the Kims into the privileged lives and home of the Parks.Beyond the deliberate ambiguity of the title (which, like Jordan Peele’s oddly comparable Us, cuts both ways), Bong once again foregrounds a distrust of wealth and authority that has been a recurrent feature of his work since his 2003 breakout Memories of Murder, continuing through films as diverse as The Host, Mother, Okja and, of course, Snowpiercer, to which Parasite contains several knowing nods.The Kim family may live in sewage-flooded squalor, but they are clearly every bit as smart as, and a lot more united than, the Parks, who turn their noses up at the smell of “people who ride the subway”. Similarly, while the smug Mr Park is habitually depicted ascending the stairs of his ultra-modern home, and the Kims are pictured scampering down city steps to their own underworld apartment, it’s clear who holds the dramatic high ground.When it comes to deception, too, those on the upper rungs of the societal ladder are as practised as those upon whom they look down. In a world of vertical non-integration, Parasite finds gasp-inducing depths lurking beneath even the most apparently placid surfaces. Yet Bong is careful to keep his opposing forces keenly balanced, creating the cinematic equivalent of a Rorschach inkblot test in which the audience is invited to decide for themselves the precise meaning of these strangely symmetrical apparitions.Perfectly accompanying the film’s tonal shifts is Jung Jae-il’s magnificently modulated music, which moves from the sombre piano patterns of the curtain-raiser, through the mini symphony of The Belt of Faith to the cracked craziness of cues in which choric vocals do battle with a musical saw. Just as the action can segue from slapstick to horror and back – sometimes within the space of a single scene – so Jung plays things straight even as madness beckons, ensuring that the underlying elements of pathos are amplified rather than undercut by pastiche.For me, Parasite is best described as a melancholy ghost story, albeit one disguised beneath umpteen layers of superbly designed (and impeccably photographed) generic mutations. Thrillingly played by a flawless ensemble cast who hit every note and harmonic resonance of Bong and co-writer Han Jin-won’s multitonal script, it’s a tragicomic masterclass that will get under your skin and eat away at your cinematic soul."
Underwater review – Kristen Stewart vehicle sinks without trace,A substandard subaqua version of Alien that throws away characterisation in search of cheap thrills,2,"This underwater disaster flick, set on a deep-sea drilling rig, doesn’t even bother to disguise the fact that it’s essentially a subaqua version of Alien. But the inevitable comparisons do the film no favours – the dive bomb into immediate action means that the characters are barely sketched, giving us little to care about. Character archetypes are present and correct, with TJ Miller drawing the short straw as the brash, gum-chewing wild card who is destined for a particularly colourful close encounter. The murky cinematography further hinders a picture that looks as though it was shot through raw sewage."
Mr Jones review – gripping Stalin-era thriller with James Norton,"On the cusp of the second world war, with Hitler stirring his power base and Stalin selling the idea of a communist utopia to the west, a young Welsh journalist takes the unfashionable stance that there is only one “truth”. Gareth Jones (James Norton), former adviser to prime minister Lloyd George, hustles a trip to Moscow with the intention of interviewing Stalin, but instead stumbles on the story of a man-made famine in Ukraine.",4,"Twenty minutes have been cut from Agnieszka Holland’s fact-based drama since its premiere last year and the result is a stirring, at times vividly inventive piece of film-making that strikes a note of warning about the risks of fake news. Holland fills the Moscow cityscape with colour – skies of Soviet red and interiors decorated in a decadent palette of bourbon and naked flesh – then evokes icebound Ukraine in a stripped-down monochrome. A subplot about George Orwell is perhaps surplus to requirements, but otherwise the film is a striking, efficient political thriller."
Plus One review – a rom com worth falling for,A predictable odd-couple romance is given extra zest by the fantastic on-screen chemistry of its leads,4,"Wedding season has staked its claim over the summer months of newly single Alice (Maya Erskine) and perennial bachelor Ben (Jack Quaid). And in order to weather the cringey speeches and mass-catering slop – and to avoid the dreaded singles table – the college buddies decide to team up and attend together. No surprises in how this chipper on/off romance plays out, but the sharp writing by first-time directing duo Jeff Chan and Andrew Rhymer, and the kind of chemistry between the leads that could fuel space travel, makes for a fresh and forthright take on the rom com.Quaid (the son of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid) teeters on the brink between smooth and smarmy as entitled Ben, whose impossibly high standards see him cooling on each new relationship within a matter of weeks. But Erskine, with her earthy chuckle and precision-tooled comic timing, is the real discovery here. She’s a smutty, sniggering joy in the role and I can’t wait to see what she does next."
The Lighthouse review – inner demons get lost in the fog,This period chiller starring Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe sacrifices storyline for atmosphere,2,"In conjuring mood, atmosphere and mounting tension, American writer-director Robert Eggers is a skilful craftsman. Following his taut 2015 debut feature, The Witch, cult indie production company A24 has given him carte blanche and, to his credit, Eggers hasn’t held back. A spooky, late-Victorian period piece, shot in black and white on location in Nova Scotia, this two-hander features Willem Dafoe as bossy, flatulent lighthouse keeper Thomas Wake, and Robert Pattinson as his younger, more taciturn apprentice, Ephraim Winslow. The island’s quirks include appalling weather, a belligerent seagull, and a stash of kerosene for when the rum runs dry. A perfect storm for a descent into madness.There are striking details and images to admire, such as the film’s use of the 1.19:1 Movietone ratio, recalling the square framing of early sound movies, or Pattinson’s oil-slicked cheekbones blanched to blinding white. Yet increasingly these devices begin to feel like technical exercises that dazzle while obscuring the story – or lack thereof. The lighthouse itself is a liminal space between land and sea that works as a kind of purgatory, though the assaulting whirr of machinery suggests the churning cogs of hell. The narrative tracks the disintegration of a man’s spirit, but Eggers is interested in his guts (the film is ripe with sewage, semen and chamber pots of shit), not his soul. Frat boy humour is dressed up in an expensive, arthouse jacket.Dafoe is credible as a man dotty with power, but Pattinson, despite his go-for-broke energy, strains to keep up. The lewd, overwrought, Herman Melville-inspired dialogue is alternately mumbled and shouted, the intense, grand guignol performances more interesting as an experiment (what if we could get Willem Dafoe to bark like a dog?) than conducive to eliciting meaning."
Risky turns and buried treasure: the best of Sundance 2020,"Critics sniffing out gems at the US indie film festival found an Italian foodie treat, a career high for Miranda July – and solid proof that a Peter Pan remake rarely flies",0,"As glamorous as covering the Sundance film festival can be – this year’s opening night delivered Taylor Swift to wintry Park City, Utah – it’s an assignment that can make a critic feel like a dog. You’re constantly nosing around for new treasures: buzzy finds, hopefully wonderful. You’re eating scraps at parties or in alleys. You always have to pee.So it made perfect sense when, early in the week, we found The Truffle Hunters – the most apt movie that will ever emerge from a film festival, anywhere. It’s an exquisite, frequently funny documentary about an Italian trade in its twilight phase: the woodsy pursuit of ultra-expensive white Alba truffles undertaken by elderly men and their canine companions (who do all the work). We come to know and love these dogs, with names like Birba and Titina, blessed by sombre priests who pray for a lucky season, and doted on like gifted children. And while co-directors Michael Dweck and Gregory Kershaw (of 2018’s gorgeous The Last Race) strap a wearable camera on a pooch’s head for some killer footage, their perspective is usually one of elegant distance, all the better to tease out notes of darkening fortune and human-animal kinship. An instant foodie hit (Sony Picture Classics snapped it up), it was the closest thing to a consensus favourite.If only the truffle hunt proved as easy for us critics during the rest of the fest. In recent years, Sundance has proved to be a reliable launch pad for an extraordinary amount of best-of-year work: everything from dramatic powerhouses such as Call Me By Your Name and The Souvenir to head-spinning horror sensations Get Out and Hereditary. Now, as seen with the slick Swift profile Miss Americana, Sundance’s opening-night selection can be streaming on Netflix before the festival even ends. Every annual film showcase from Cannes downwards is wrestling with these questions of exclusivity and access – Sundance more than most, with its reputation as keeper of the American indie flame.To its programmers’ credit, the festival seems to have responded by doubling down on riskiness. If you were willing to put in the work, there was much value to be found in 2020’s lineup, which yielded several small-scale triumphs, intimate in scope but deep in feeling and spirit. Female directors may be exotic creatures to Bafta and Oscar voters, but at Sundance they represented a robust 46% of the titles in competition.Moreover, the female-driven films were far and away superior. Hitting a career high, Miranda July (Me and You and Everyone We Know) unleashed her magnificently weird heist comedy Kajillionare, a cross between Wes Anderson and Michael Mann, starring Richard Jenkins, Debra Winger and a heartbreakingly good Evan Rachel Wood. They play a long-haired family of Los Angeles grifters desperate to scheme their way through another day of existence; all of them are unprepared for their youngest member’s romantic awakening.Cameraperson documentarian Kirsten Johnson gave us Dick Johnson Is Dead, a playfully profound, Agnès Varda-esque collaboration with her octogenarian dad, shot while he was slipping into dementia. (In the wake of the shocking mid-festival news about Kobe Bryant and his daughter, Johnson’s film – a lingering goodbye – felt like a gift.)And wrecked audiences leapt to their feet in praise after seeing Eliza Hittman’s ruinous Never Rarely Sometimes Always, feminist in subject matter and execution. An unflinching depiction of a Pennsylvania teen’s secret quest to get an abortion, the drama from the writer-director of 2017’s Beach Rats feels like a sister to the 2007 Romanian classic 4 Months, 3 Weeks & 2 Days – with the extra frisson that this particular journey to the grungy transit hubs of New York seems even more harrowing than living in a communist country in the 1980s. There’s a soft, anonymous, even awkward quality to the actors Hittman prefers to cast; Never’s Sidney Flanigan and Talia Ryder (the latter playing a supportive cousin who comes along) could be any random kids, adding to the universality of women’s rights under siege.Sundance’s most fearless titles unspooled to the droning backdrop of the Trump impeachment hearings, increasingly an exercise in fact-avoidance. In contrast, film-makers pursued their truths to the bitter end: Welcome to Chechnya, a galvanising documentary about the smuggling of LGBTQ people out of a country that criminalises them, was the festival’s most rousing and essential film. Director David France, already famous for his 2012 history of the Aids activist group Act Up in How to Survive a Plague, summons the nervous energy of a peak Bourne thriller. (Some escapees appeared at post-screening Q&As, bold acts of public defiance.) Crip Camp, about the 1970s rise of the disability-rights movement, had a sun-dappled, utopian heart. Even The Go-Go’s – you knew a movie called The Go-Go’s was bound to arrive one day – rhapsodised about the punk movement that nourished and radicalised the 1980s all-female band (regardless of their inability to play instruments).The films weren’t all great. Benh Zeitlin, the wunderkind whose 2012 Beasts of the Southern Wild soared from Sundance all the way to the Academy Awards, arrived with his aggressively “magical” Wendy, proving once again that adapting Peter Pan is a fool’s errand for talented up-and-comers and Hollywood titans alike. Filled to the brim with screechy children jumping off cliffs, the movie is larded with dialogue that sounds like adolescent self-therapy: doubt yourself and you’re old already. Never slow down. Never think twice. And Mudbound’s Dee Rees, another Sundance success story, floundered with her convoluted The Last Thing He Wanted (based on Joan Didion’s 1996 spy novel), starring a stalwart Anne Hathaway as a chain-smoking reporter trapped between Contra arms deals and bad sex with Ben Affleck.Those two selections seemed loyal to a fault, whereas the actual spirit of today’s Sundance is revisionary. It was only three years ago that Harvey Weinstein mingled among the pink hats at a Sundance women’s march. The seismic impact of #MeToo and Time’s Up continues to be felt, evidenced by the well-received On the Record, a lucid yet enraged documentary by Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering that unpacks the rape accusations lodged against Def Jam mogul Russell Simmons. “I didn’t want to let the culture down,” says conflicted former A&R executive Drew Dixon – herself allegedly a victim of Simmons’s predations while still viewing him as a hero to the black community – in one of the most complex moments of shame, regret and fury at the festival.Meanwhile, the tonsorial pressures of working at a fictional 1980s African American music channel found its fun expression in Bad Hair, a quasi-political, half-successful horror-comedy about a possessed weave from Dear White People director Justin Simien, a man who knows how to parody a Janet Jackson hit: I Get It colonised this head for days.Elsewhere, female empowerment shone brightly in Herself, an Irish starting-over drama from Phyllida Lloyd built on the durable Wild Rose formula, scorched eyeballs in the rape-revenge provocation Promising Young Woman (starring Carey Mulligan), and made a glorious mess of things in Shirley, an Edward Albee-esque campus psychodrama starring Elisabeth Moss – in a raw, ragged turn that would make Jennifer Jason Leigh proud – as the liberated novelist Shirley Jackson. Shirley represents a major step forward for the stylish, near-experimental film-maker Josephine Decker (Madeline’s Madeline), whose atmospheric nuances were a perfect match for an essentially literary story that desperately needed breath in its lungs.Still, for all this valid screenwriting, wouldn’t you know that a film based on tweets would suck up all the attention? Zola, a strippers-turned-sex-workers caper developed by Janicza Bravo from a viral 148-tweet thread, accrued some early buzz for its dense, Twitter-whistling soundscape and ultra-confident performances from Taylour Paige and the always interesting Riley Keough. To my eyes, though, we weren’t seeing something nearly as poetic as Harmony Korine’s trash-terpiece Spring Breakers. Rather, with Zola’s extended twerking shots and sub-Hustlers scenes of reinvention, we were lapping up sexploitation. (Composer Mica Levi, a genius constructor of trashy little beats, understood the gig better than anyone involved.)Zola went down too easily; The Nowhere Inn, co-written by Annie Clark (AKA St Vincent) and Carrie Brownstein, knocked you back like a harsh shot of 180-proof strangeness. Kicking off in the vein of a Portlandia-like mockumentary about art-rock lifestyles, the film gets progressively more vicious, arriving – via a few Lynchian side streets – at the pungent idea that maybe we don’t want to demystify our pop stars all that much. Why do we need them to be like us? “I wanted us to be deeply, deeply, narcissistically unlikable,” Clark told viewers of the midnight world premiere, left stunned by a tour flick as distinctly fragrant as Prince’s Under the Cherry Moon, and sure to accrue its own legion of obsessives. That’s the truffle stink we were hunting for all week.Best filmsWelcome to Chechnya, an instant LGBTQ landmark; the stealth heartbreaker Kajillionaire; deceptively deep foodie film The Truffle Hunters.Worst filmsCringingly shameless opioid drama Four Good Days; the boring haunted-widow horror film The Night House; Romola Garai’s inauspicious directorial debut, Amulet.Best performanceElisabeth Moss tears it up as a frazzled, unpredictable force of nature in Shirley (and her counterpart, Michael Stuhlbarg, is equally impressive).Worst performanceAny of the obnoxiously wonderstruck kids in Wendy.Weirdest, most welcome supporting actorWillem Dafoe in The Last Thing He Wanted, as Anne Hathaway’s hard-drinking, arms-dealer dad — couldn’t the whole movie have been about him?Biggest sale A record $17.5m – plus an additional 69 cents to beat 2016’s The Birth of a Nation – for the rights to the surreal Andy Samberg comedy Palm Springs.Sweetest line of dialogueFrom Miranda July’s euphoric Kajillionaire: “Most happiness comes from dumb things.”Yuckiest horror film that wasn’t quite a horror filmBrandon (son of David) Cronenberg’s Possessor: yes, he also enjoys making a squishy, splattery mess of the human body.Most perfectly OK Hollywood remake of a far-better foreign filmDownhill, an unsurprising re-do of the brilliant Swedish family meltdown Force Majeure.

A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood – touching tribute to a US TV hero,Tom Hanks is wholesomeness itself in Marielle Heller’s tribute to US children’s TV star Mister Rogers,4,"Fred Rogers – beloved in the States for his unfailingly sanguine persona, but largely unknown in the UK – was an American television presenter and the man behind the popular, long-running children’s series Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood.This exquisite adaptation of Tom Junod’s 1998 Esquire profile paints a carefully shaded picture from a sceptic’s vantage point. When investigative reporter Lloyd Vogel (Matthew Rhys) is assigned a puff piece about one of the nation’s heroes, he takes it upon himself to locate the dark heart of Mr Rogers (Tom Hanks, the epitome of on-screen goodness). There isn’t one. Director Marielle Heller (2015’s The Diary of a Teenage Girl, 2018’s Can You Ever Forgive Me) cleverly mines comedy from Rogers’s boundless empathy as Vogel tries to probe for weak spots, finding only his own. Through their interaction he is encouraged, gently, to confront his own demons and daddy issues.Rogers explains that his show tries to give children a positive way to deal with their feelings. It sounds preachy and schematic, yet the film itself is subtle, melancholy and deeply felt in its sincerity."
One Piece: Stampede review – piratical manga mayhem,This imaginative carnival of battling buccaneers makes Pirates of the Caribbean look like Swallows and Amazons,3,"This is the kind of thing a sexually frustrated cabin boy might dream up after six months shipwrecked on an all-seawater and manga diet: a power-crazed Japanese piratical fantasy that lands with all the subtlety of a 100-minute guitar solo. The world’s buccaneers all turn up to Delta Island for Pirate Fest and a chance to hunt for renowned outlaw Gol D Roger’s booty. But they’ve been hoodwinked: festival MC Buena Festa has teamed up with the grudgeful Douglas Bullet, a peanut-headed, musclebound brute with Michael Bolton hair, to lure them all into a trap to usher in a new pirate era.What starts off like cosplay Wacky Races soon snowballs into non-stop battle royale. The various pirate crews are a stupendously imaginative carnival, careering into the melee proclaiming their chosen power-move in gairaigo (ie, loanwords). These names have surreal brilliance: Gum-Gum Kong Gun, Zeus Breeze Tempest, Blade of Beauty … St Exupéry (WTF?). Dialogue is decipherable only by One Piece connoisseurs (not as much of a problem as might appear – this is the 14th film based on what is apparently the all-time bestselling manga series). Characterisation is as profound as a skeleton privateer laughing at his own farts.Every time you think director Takashi Otsuka has hit a ceiling for either ridiculousness or destructiveness, he effortlessly busts through both. “Go be the strongest somewhere else,” yells the masochistic hero Monkey D Luffy (voiced by Mayumi Takana and Colleen Clinkenbeard) after yet another beating by Bullet. The character animation is rough-hewn and spirited, all the better to capture One Piece’s scurvy rabble, and contrasts well with the digitally invoked mayhem, like Bullet’s purple crystal tsunamis. All the destruction does get a bit wearing, but it seems churlish to complain: this makes Pirates of the Caribbean look like Swallows and Amazons. One Piece: Stampede is released in the UK on 2 February."
Wendy review – Peter Pan fantasy that never grows up into an interesting film,Beasts of the Southern Wild director Benh Zeitlin returns with an overlong and sometimes excruciating update of the Pan story ,2,"Wendy, a spin on JM Barrie’s Peter Pan myth, takes all the chaos, noise and lack-of-focus of director Benh Zeitlin’s earlier picture Beasts of the Southern Wild and amplifies it. The 2012 surprise hit, which went from Sundance discovery to four Academy Award nominations, got a tremendous amount of mileage from its peculiarity of place and heartfelt father-daughter relationship. That’s very much missing here. What we’re left with is something like Spike Jonze’s 2009 adaptation of Where the Wild Things Are without the adorable creatures. Wendy is undoubtedly self-assured and in-your-face, and the gorgeous location photography certainly has an impact. But it’s wrecked by chapters so lengthy they become simply excruciating.We begin with a tense scene in a greasy spoon diner loaded with crusty characters inches from a train yard hauling freight. After a child totters off and disappears, we cut years later to three pre-adolescent siblings (friends of the missing kid), children of the restaurant’s hardworking but loving single mom owner. From the window of her bedroom, Wendy (Devin French) spies a kid on the roof of a passing train and takes a leap of faith. Her twin brothers (Gage and Gavin Naquin) follow. In time (and via many methods of transport) they arrive in a mystical land where unaccompanied minors are free to stomp around, yell and never grow up.Peter (Yashua Mack) is anarchy incarnate, and his attitude to the newcomers swerves between indifference and welcoming. The only rule seems to be to never grow up, and we’ll eventually see the sad sacks who did (one with a hook for a hand!) and now live on the dreary side of the island. This leads to some defections, rescues, fights and revelations, all to the cacophony of kids with limitless, high-volume lungs.But here’s the thing: is there no independent film-maker whois honest enough to say that kids want to play video games, not romp around with sticks? Where, in real life, are these return-to-Walden youngsters so beloved by Brooklyn-based storytellers? All I see are kids addicted to their phones.The film’s sequences of extreme youthful vigor continue at interminable length, and I suspect even the most whimsy-prone will grow tired of it. There are some half-baked environmentalist lessons, in case anyone is worried Wendy may inspire copycat crimes of childhood disobedience to no higher purpose. These come from a new-to-the-Peter-Pan-franchise character called Mother, a sea creature who is the living heart of the island and who toots out explosions from volcanos. This all looks great, proving absolutely that Zeitlin does have acuity for creating individual moments. But it goes on and on and on.To be fair, the picture ends with quite an emotional thrill which, to my great surprise, I found sincerely moving. The tightly edited final sequence is an effective admixture of movie magic and it sends one out of Wendy with chills. It might even be enough to make some reconsider the discomfort of the rest of the film. But I can withstand such lures: Neverland, never again."
The Nest review – Jude Law and Carrie Coon fall apart in eerie 80s drama,The director of Martha Marcy May Marlene has delivered an accomplished follow-up focused on a family imploding in a gloomy house in Surrey,4,"There’s always a warm homecoming at festivals for directors who return after breaking out there years prior, as well as an unspoken fear that their follow-up might not have quite the same impact. In 2011, Sean Durkin premiered his first feature, the chilly psychodrama Martha Marcy May Marlene, at Sundance and won a directing award as well as a flurry of excitable reviews, planting his name, as well as star Elizabeth Olsen’s, on the map. It was the kind of jolting debut that made anyone who watched it curious to know what he would do next. In the nine years since, he directed the disturbing British miniseries Southcliffe, but has been notably absent from the big screen. He returns to the fold this year with the accomplished and uneasy family drama The Nest, a film with a delicate slow build that feels fitting for a director who’s also taken his time to make it.Durkin, who was born in Canada before moving to Britain and then New York, has taken elements from his continent-hopping youth for the plot of his latest, the story of a family making the big move and the emotional rot that sets in. It’s the 1980s, and the O’Haras are leaving their suburban American setting to live in the UK, where father Rory (Jude Law) was born. His American wife Alison (Carrie Coon) is unsure, having moved four times in the past 10 years, but he’s convinced there are financial opportunities they simply can’t afford to turn down. He works as a commodities broker but is driven by an ambition to do and make more, and as they settle into their new lives at a grandiose country mansion in Surrey, his excitement for what lies ahead starts to unravel.Rory is a convincingly cocksure smooth-talker whose embrace of the American dream has returned him to England with a different, more daring worldview. He’s hungry and wants to give his family more, even if they might already have enough. His background was one of limited means and so his idea of happiness is somewhat skewed, forever trying to play the part of a man he never thought he could become, tirelessly constructing an extravagant self-image to mask his working-class origins. But it means he’s often blinded to what his family really needs, and so as he pushes them further and further into a financial bracket they cannot easily sustain, cracks start to appear.There’s a deftly controlled interplay between a man who wants to be in control in a traditional sense and a quietly strong-willed wife who wants to allow him this but fears for the price his reckless decision-making might have on their family. Alison is constantly told she doesn’t need to concern herself with the bigger picture (“It’s not your job to worry,” Rory tells her at one point) but she’s smart enough to know something is awry. The ridiculously ostentatious house they live in, the hunt for a Mayfair apartment, talk of a condo in the Algarve – it’s all, embarrassingly, obviously too much. Watching Alison gain the strength to challenge Rory, sometimes in darkly amusing ways, gives the film some of its most dramatically juicy moments but the film avoids feeding us the more predictably telegraphed conflict we might expect from the set-up.Because The Nest is a slow burn, requiring extreme, dedicated patience even from those familiar with Durkin’s last film. He gently plays with genre tropes, briefly fooling us into thinking that maybe we’re watching a horror film set in a dark, decaying old house, but the horror is of a more human kind as the decay starts to infect the family dynamic, slowly but surely taking them to a place that might not allow for a return. Law is an actor known for his magnetic charm, but it’s always more compelling to watch it backgrounded by a certain darkness, and this is him at his best, playing a man who starts to question the bullshit he’s lived by for so long. Coon, an actor who typically finds a way of stealing whatever film she’s in no matter how small the role, is also on top form, gently crumbling while also finding herself as a woman. The pair convince entirely as a married couple with a history, shown less to us through exposition and more through day-to-day behaviour.It’s elegantly constructed and precisely composed, with Durkin painstakingly recreating an era without falling into nostalgic overload. But it’s also a drama about a family that keeps us at a distance for the most part. It’s intriguing without always being involving and while the lethargic narrative might speed up in the final act, it’s only by a fraction and I wanted just a little bit more of something to grasp on to at the end, having spent so much time with characters I found so fascinating. I feel as though The Nest will haunt me though with its eerie portrait of a family falling apart without ever being sure if they can put themselves back together again.The Nest is showing at the Sundance film festival with a release date yet to be announced"
Downhill review – Ferrell and Louis-Dreyfus crash with redundant remake,An unnecessary English language remake of 2014’s savage marital comedy Force Majeure never manages to rise above the pointlessness of its inception,2,"When it was announced in 2018 that the critically adored Swedish comedy Force Majeure would be remade by Fox, the overwhelming response from anyone who had seen the original was one of quizzical exhaustion. Why just four years after it won the Un Certain Regard jury prize at Cannes do we need to see a more “palatable” English-speaking remix? And is this still where we’re at as an industry and a culture that an arguably perfect film needs to be retouched just because it’s afflicted with subtitles?There was also something strangely dated about the news, the sort of quickie remake that seems to mercifully happen less these days, a slowing trend that’s the result of a string of flops as well as a wider embrace and respect of international cinema. But what kept Downhill on many a radar regardless was an undeniably impressive roster of talent. Will Ferrell and Julia Louis-Dreyfus (making a rare big-screen appearance) would play the leads. Peep Show and Succession’s Jesse Armstrong would co-write the script. And, most importantly, the film would have the blessing of the original’s writer-director Ruben Östlund. Might there be a reason for retelling this story in a different language that’s bigger than “just because”?The story of both films hinges on a devastating moment of panic and the emotional wreckage it then leaves. Pete (Ferrell) and Billie (Louis-Dreyfus) have taken their sons on a family ski trip to the Alps, mistakenly at a location that’s more suited to those wishing to party than parent. During a lunch outside one day, a controlled avalanche nearby thrusts a cloud of snow their way and fearing the worst, Pete grabs his phone and leaves his family. He returns to find them safe but his kneejerk reaction creates a rapidly expanding crack in his relationship.What remains potent from original to remake is the unease of the premise, the uncomfortable questions it invites into a seemingly sturdy marriage, the sort of mistake that’s so instinctive that it’s impossible to explain away. In the moment, he chose himself, and his phone, over his loved ones and there’s no form of apology that can provide him any cover. But there’s something just a few degrees off about Downhill, a niggling sense that not only was the decision to reheat a recent, universally acclaimed film unnecessary but that the decisions being made by Armstrong along with writer-director team Nat Faxon and Jim Rash are often rather misjudged.There’s a wrestle going on throughout the film’s brief 85-minute running time between a crowd-pleasing studio comedy and something more specific and low-key and it becomes progressively difficult to know how best to consume what we’re being fed. The casting of Ferrell and Louis-Dreyfus, two performers more typically associated with lighter fare, carries with it certain expectations and while Louis-Dreyfus fares well with the smaller moments, Ferrell doesn’t quite convince with a performance that’s forever threatening to break out into his more familiar showboat shtick. There’s a lived-in chemistry that’s missing from the pairing and the film’s great many awkward moments between them don’t feel quite as cutting or as uncomfortable as they should. It’s a dark comedy that feels too light.There’s also a distracting outsized comic performance from Miranda Otto playing a sex-crazed Austrian who would feel more at home in a Eurotrip sequel than a considered study of marital discord. She’s just another mismatched element in a film filled with them, each clanging against the other. There are some brief insights along the way, including a potentially knotty examination of how fractions within a family can prove alienating but the film’s commentary is largely surface-level. An attempt to contrast the pair with a younger couple is similarly superficial with lazy culture clash jokes mostly involving their use of hashtags. The slightness of the plot gave room for the characters to breathe in Force Majeure but when transported to a broader, slicker canvas, it feels somehow incomplete.Louis-Dreyfus, one of the best and most empathetic comic actors working today, is easily the standout but there’s never quite enough for her to do or say, at least not enough to warrant her alleged five-year mission to make it. Her last film was 2013’s Enough Said, Nicole Holofcener’s wonderful, humane, funny romantic comedy which gifted her with a living, breathing character who added depth to the film’s sitcom premise but her appearance in Downhill just caused me to crave more for her, something with a trickier edge perhaps, something that feels less of a given that she can pull off without breaking a sweat. I’d struggle on the spot to highlight one particular scene where she gets a moment to truly shine but then that’s a problem with the film as a whole. It doesn’t have the stickiness of the original, it’s a smooth assembly job without an edge, an agreeable enough extended episode of a show you half-watch but nothing more.There’s nothing exactly catastrophic here but what no one involved in the film manages to do is provide adequate evidence for why this needed to exist in the first place. Ostlund should reconsider his blessing.Downhill is showing at the Sundance film festival and will be released in the US on 14 February and in the UK on 28 February."
Surge review – Ben Whishaw pounds the streets in gripping psychodrama,"The tension builds repeatedly in Aneil Karia’s fierce, atmospheric tale of a security officer who strides out on a surreal odyssey after losing his job",3,"After some much-admired short films, including the excellent Bafta-nominated Work, British film-maker Aneil Karia now makes a vehement, if flawed feature debut at the Sundance film festival. It’s a fierce, claustrophobic and atmospheric character study with a big pressure-cooker performance from Ben Whishaw playing Joseph, a young airport security officer who succumbs to a breakdown due to loneliness, insomnia and unresolved feelings for his co-worker Lily (Jasmine Jobson). Joseph loses it big time at work, walks off the job and, with his brain almost audibly pulsing with suppressed craziness, strides through the clamorous, uncaring London streets on an odyssey of chaos and confrontation. This involves many surreally disturbing scenes with total strangers – but also with Lily and his equally unhappy mum and dad (Ellie Haddington and Ian Gelder), encounters that involve unexpected moments of tenderness.The movie’s title is well chosen. Almost each individual scene – and arguably the film itself – is a surge, an oppressive swelling of the meteorological pressure in Joseph’s head. Each sequence seems to be building, building, building to something, but then, instead of a climax, we enigmatically cut to another scene later and reset for another psycho-emotional surge. It’s a shrewd depiction of the banal day-to-day unhappiness that Joseph lives with. Each body search that Joseph has to do at the security gates involves an unbearable official intimacy with a total stranger, one of whom is clearly disturbed; and, for an awful moment here, Joseph’s own palpable instability is such that the audience can’t be sure which is mad and which is sane.Violence or some sort of outbreak is clearly unavoidable, yet when the violence comes it seems almost indistinguishable in dramatic terms from the tense brooding prelude. Whishaw’s performance is mostly a wordless anthology of flinches, tics, grimaces, periods of unsettling blankness, together with a bit of Henry-Portrait-of-a-Serial-Killer looking in the mirror. It would not have worked with an actor any less accomplished and charismatic than Whishaw. He certainly sells it hard.This is an intriguing essay in mood, but I felt that the feature-film length of Surge tests the material. Perhaps it would have worked better as a short film, based around the great opening scenes at the airport, with Joseph in his heartbreakingly drab uniform with the V-neck jumper and ID on a lanyard. There are times when Surge feels directionless: in his despair and near-madness – and desperate for five quid so he can buy an HDMI cable to fix Lily’s TV – Joseph turns to a life of crime, doing no fewer than three bank stick-ups without ever having to deal with a police officer. Wouldn’t the police be a bit more on the ball with something like this? Maybe not.Weirdly, these crimes themselves feel like part of the weightless, consequence-free bad dream that is Joseph’s lawless existence. Karia never loses control of the mood, but the mood itself seems almost unchanging. There are some extraordinary images, particularly one in which Joseph, in his delirium, gets a room in a posh hotel, and then rips open the mattress and climbs inside this quasi-womb. Karia is a smart film-maker and this is a valuable beginning. Surge is released in the UK on 28 May, in cinemas and on digital platforms."
The Goop Lab review – so Gwyneth Paltrow doesn’t know what a vagina is,"Like the star’s wellness brand, this whole show is a demented paean to self-indulgence. And for someone peddling health treatments, she seems alarmingly ignorant about anatomy",1,"She suggests you steam it, put jade eggs up it and recently launched a candle that smells like it, but Gwyneth Paltrow seems not to know what a vagina is.That’s the takeaway from The Goop Lab, the Netflix series launched to bring Paltrow’s lifestyle brand to a wider audience. The moment the high priestess of the pudenda’s ignorance is revealed comes in the third of six episodes, entitled The Pleasure Is Hers, courtesy of Betty Dodson. Dodson is a 90-year-old New Yorker and old-school feminist who has been teaching female masturbation workshops for half a century. She lets Gwyneth speak about the holy of holies for a bit. Then she leans forward and tells her: “The vagina is the birth canal only. Ya wanna talk about the vulva – that’s the clitoris, the inner lips and all that good shit around it.” The high priestess of the pudenda is shook. “I thought the vagina was the whole thing?” It’s almost as though she never had any idea what she was talking about. Her CEO, Elise Loehnen, fails to improve matters when she thinks Betty’s patented “rock’n’roll” method for inducing female orgasm involves rocking from side-to-side.Nor did Gwyneth have any idea that porn stars have often had labiaplasty to make themselves look “neat”. Which is an almost impressive level of ignorance for anyone who pretends an interest in feminist issues and women’s health to have maintained in the year of our lord 2020, and proud testimony to the impregnability of the Paltrovian bubble. How nice it must be to live there.Anyway. Dodson, possibly enjoying herself by now, further startles Gwynnie with the notion that, to maximise their pleasure during sex, “women have got to learn how to ‘run the fuck’.” She is worth the price of admission alone. Which is good because nothing else in The Goop Lab is.From vampire-facialled head to seaweed-wrapped toe, it’s exactly the guff you would expect. Self-indulgence is relabelled self-care and raised to high art. Massages are everywhere. Expensive diets to improve longevity are embarked upon. Paltrow’s blood is taken and reinjected into her face because when you look good, you feel good, right? In most episodes, the Goop team are sent on a glamorous foreign trip – to Jamaica, for example, to take magic mushrooms and call them “a healing modality” – where they try out various unregulated “therapies” while lawyers sit in their offices feverishly checking that all waivers have been signed.There is an adamantine refusal to accept that sorrow and anxiety are attendant upon life all the way through, and a demented commitment to expunging every negative moment from it, whether by vegan eating, cold plunges, the cleansing of energy fields, psychic intervention or any other pseudoscientific activity that can be monetised for people whose gullibility marches in lockstep with their wealth.The place is awash with thin blonde women, pastels and vocal fry. Virtually the only men you see are more or less creepy advocates for whatever wellness therapy they have developed, patented and depend on for their incomes. It is the cult of the individual taken to its logical conclusion. It is the zenith and nadir of late western capitalism. It is six hours of masturbation, albeit not of a kind Betty would recognise.And all that is before we get to the potential harm done by this sort of claptrap feeding into the thinking behind eating disorders, promulgating the very narrowest of beauty and fitness aesthetics, and contributing to the notion that to those who have (wealth, leisure, social capital) shall be given more (life, health, happiness).Like an overpriced jade egg, I say you can shove it up your jacksie. Someone commission a series from Betty and let’s sort this mess out."
#AnneFrank. Parallel Stories review – Helen Mirren hosts a heartfelt tribute,"This moving, valuable documentary marking the 75th anniversary of the Auschwitz liberation draws on the testimony of many Holocaust survivors",4,"The 75th anniversary of the Auschwitz liberation has been marked by this heartfelt and valuable documentary, presented on camera by Helen Mirren, centring on the Anne Frank story (Mirren is shown in a reconstruction of Anne’s secret room in the Amsterdam house, and reading from her diaries) but also bringing in testimony from many current Holocaust survivors, and their families, as well as talking to archivists and historians.It is a film that is targeted at younger people with what is perhaps an educational mission, and with this in mind there is a connecting-thread motif. It periodically imagines a young woman travelling by rail all over Europe to various historical sites, ending in Amsterdam, posting pictures and thoughts on Instagram, hashtagging key phrases.Perhaps the film needed that, perhaps it didn’t; and I have to admit I also wasn’t entirely sure about Mirren’s readings in which she will often catch her breath with emotion. It’s entirely sincere, of course, but unearned, compared to the calm, frank and unshowy testimony of the survivors themselves.But, in the main, this is a very substantial and worthwhile film, with eyewitness accounts supplemented by robust contributions from people such as historian Michael Birnbaum, and a clear guide to the way that our understanding of the Holocaust has grown, beginning with that historic moment in which it was arguably crystallised in the public mind: the 1961 Adolf Eichmann trial.There are some amazing Shoah exhibits all over the world, which are often very beautiful and moving – and, incidentally, a very shrewd account of the Terezin ghetto in the Czech Republic. And I’m always surprised by how many extant photographs there are of Anne Frank herself, whose image gives this story such power. #AnneFrank. Parallel Stories is released in the UK on 27 January. This article was amended on 24 January 2020 to clarify that Helen Mirren filmed in a reconstruction of Anne Frank’s “secret room”, not in the room itself as an earlier version implied."
"Paw Patrol: Ready, Race, Rescue! review – 48 minutes in the pits",This barely feature-length spin-off from the TV cartoon takes our gang to the racetrack and sends them skidding into tedium,2,"They sure do churn em out. Here’s another episode of Nickelodeon’s animated TV show about a team of rescue dogs, jazzed up and padded out into a 48-minute cinema package. As a parent of a toddler, I’m not immune to Paw Patrol pester power. But I find the cinema outings soulless and depressing: three-year-olds disappearing into gawping trances, parents into the glow of their phones.The new film feels like a cut-price knockoff of Pixar’s Cars, with a dull plot about a rally tournament where the star driver is a flashy but nice kid called the Whoosh (voiced by Joseph Motiki) and the Paw Patrol gang’s job is to crew the pitstop during the race. The villain is mega-sneaky racing driver Cheetah (Addison Holley), who introduces yet another irritatingly repetitive Paw Patrol catchphrase: “If you can’t beat ’em, cheat ’em!” When the Whoosh crashes out after being nobbled by Cheetah, firefighter pup Marshall (Lukas Engel) must take his place behind the wheel.Can Marshall dodge Cheetah’s dirty tricks and overcome his lack of confidence to take first place? All the usual believe-in-yourself, hard-work-wins messages apply, alongside some screechy tyre-burning action. But there’s zero here for adults: Paw Patrol is action with stabilisers, training little kids up for big kid bangs. It’s so aggressively targeted at pre-schoolers that in no sense can you call it a family movie. And parents who’ve forked out for a flashing Paw Patrol toothbrush may blow a piston at the running gag about the Whoosh being a walking product placement, constantly mugging for the camera in his own branded merch.Paw Patrol: Ready, Race, Rescue! is released in the UK on 24 January."
Detective Chinatown 3 review – majestically madcap buddy-cop whodunnit,Martial arts star Tony Jaa joins the zany police franchise as our heroes head to Tokyo for more no-holds-barred slapstick action,3,"Asian cinema’s wackiest buddy-comedy action franchise is now at the threequel stage and after a period of bewilderment I’ve begun to enjoy its eccentric hyperactivity. The two zany Chinese cops, Qin Feng (Haoran Liu) and Tang Ren (Baoqiang Wang), have already clocked up some misadventures in Bangkok for the first film and New York for the second (which featured a peculiar cameo from Michael Pitt); now the daffy duo rock up in Tokyo, where they have been summoned to tackle a bizarre crime.A local gang boss has been murdered, apparently by a turf rival called Watanabe (Miura Tomokazu) over dinner, but this man insists he’s innocent and demands our heroes find the evidence that will acquit him. The rest of the film is one bonkers digression after another, concerning some strange criminal conspiracies and the shadowy motivations of the victim’s assistant Anna Kobayashi (Masami Nagasawa).The Thai action star Tony Jaa makes an appearance for some enjoyable martial arts sequences, and there’s a small role for the veteran Japanese player Tadanobu Asano – who appeared in Takashi Miike’s cult shocker Ichi the Killer – as a police detective. You can’t fault this film for its ambition and its willingness to pull out all the stops in terms of spectacle, especially during a colossal slapstick fight scene at Tokyo airport and zany chaos at Tokyo’s world-famous Shibuya crossing.Bizarrely, after all the knockabout absurdity, the movie climaxes with a melodramatic court scene involving a passionate speech and a sentimental flashback to the culprit’s unhappy childhood. We get a diverting moment when the “locked room” detective-story theories of mystery author John Dickson Carr are given an airing. There’s a puppyish charm here.The release of Detective Chinatown 3 has been postponed due to the coronavirus outbreak."
Be Natural: The Untold Story of Alice Guy-Blaché review – paean to a movie pioneer,This intriguing documentary shines a light on the astonishing career of the first woman to direct a film – and possibly the first director ever,4,"Pamela B Green’s hectic, garrulous, fascinating documentary recovers the story of French film-maker Alice Guy-Blaché (working from Alison McMahan’s book Alice Guy-Blaché: Lost Visionary of the Cinema). She was a hugely important pioneer of early cinema who was the first woman to direct a feature film – perhaps the first director ever – a figure admired by Eisenstein and Hitchcock, and a prolific director, screenwriter, producer and prototypical studio chief who helped invent the idiom of modern movie-making. The notice “Be Natural” on the wall of her Solax studio in New Jersey was a testament to her belief that, however stylised and generic, acting and films in general should not be bizarre pantomimes but artworks connected to the real world.The documentary is narrated by its producer Jodie Foster, and tells the remarkable life story of a woman who was one of the first entranced witnesses to the Lumières’ initial screenings of their cinematograph invention in Paris. She was employed by a photography company taken over by Léon Gaumont, and from there developed her own interest in the cinema, directing what is perhaps the world’s first narrative film, entitled The Cabbage Fairy (1896) and then establishing a studio in Fort Lee, New Jersey – the place where American movie-making happened before the big move west to Hollywood.However, after her divorce and her return to France, Guy-Blaché found herself erased from history, as she failed to find work and then saw successive generations of film historians become professionally invested in the alpha-male reputations of Gaumont, Feuillade, Lumière etc.In an age when reels of celluloid easily became lost, the films themselves could not speak for Guy-Blaché, and even the great Henri Langlois, revered head of the Cinémathèque Française, appeared oblivious to her achievements. Now that is all changing. Be Natural: The Untold Story of Alice Guy-Blaché is released in the UK on 17 January."
Bad Boys for Life review – odd-couple Miami cops back with a blast,The plot’s dumb but there’s plenty to enjoy as Will Smith and Martin Lawrence return after 17 years to trade jibes and blow stuff up,3,"Martin Lawrence may not have starred in a motion picture for close to a decade, but he has a special place in my life. When I went to see his dopey 2001 comedy Black Knight, it was the first time I truly laughed with abandon post-9/11. With absolute seriousness, I will be forever grateful. So, while Bad Boys for Life has a completely asinine story, generic action, predictable plot beats, moronic dialogue and truly reprehensible politics, I still had a good time.Lawrence, who can tell an entire story on his face in one reaction shot, must shout “Oh shit!” a hundred times in Bad Boys for Life. Each time it is funny for a different reason. He uses an exclamatory “Oh shit!” the way Rembrandt used oils. If he was endearing as a young man, he is doubly so at the age of 54, with his Bad Boys character Marcus Burnett a new grandfather eager to retire from the Miami police force. He needs glasses for distance, is infrequently intimate with his wife and hears the Barcalounger calling to him. “All our lives we’ve been Bad Boys,” he says in one of the film’s more humiliating moments. “Now it’s time to be Good Men.”Marcus’s partner, however – the never-married Mike Lowery (Will Smith) – is forever committed to putting the baddies behind bars. Oh, who are we kidding? Lowery’s modus operandi here, as in the two previous Bad Boys films, is to turn lawbreakers into Swiss cheese with a barrage of bullets, or just blow them up. Good luck finding a film with a more lusty zeal for the militarisation of the police force.This latest chapter, directed by the Belgian duo Adil El Arbi and Billal Fallah, comes 17 years after the last from explosion auteur Michael Bay (who makes a cameo appearance here). The Miami PD has a new hi-tech division with drones and tanks and Arbi-Fallah’s camera drools over the weaponry more than it does over the scantily clad Florida women hanging out at the nightclubs. In one scene, when our heroes prep to go out into the field, they are forced to use rubber ammunition or “ACLU bullets”. Smith (and the movie with him) scowls at such an indignity.The Boys’ new crew is led by Smith’s maybe-some-day love interest Rita (Paola Núñez, in her first English-language feature), a striking and tough woman who, by Hollywood standards, is an age-appropriate match. (Smith is a mere 10 years Núñez’s senior.) Also in the squad is Vanessa Hudgens (given very little to do), the enormous Alexander Ludwig (playing against type as a hacker) and Charles Melton, meant to represent a new breed of Bad Boy.The team of screenwriters (Chris Bremner, Peter Craig and Joe Carnahan) are clearly trying to kickstart some kind of Fast and Furious group dynamic, but of the newcomers, only Núñez and Ludwig have any pizzazz. Regardless, the stars of the show will always be Smith and Lawrence, cussing at each other as they speed through traffic bashing into things and making things blow up. Apart from one shot that tilts the camera on its side as if you are playing your Xbox while lying down, the action scenes lack any real wow factor. What works, though, are the reactions: the screams, the swears, the quibbling between the cringing Lawrence and tough-guy Smith. It’s a formula too sweet and smooth to deny.But to simply dismiss Bad Boys for Life for being too far-fetched and violent is to close yourself off from its very real charms. There are plenty of cop-loving action movies that are reprehensible. Lawrence and Smith have that self-fulfilling X Factor. If Bob Hope and Bing Crosby had a grenade launcher, it would end up a little like this. Bad Boys for Life is released in Australia on 16 January and in the UK and the US on 17 January."
Lucian Freud: A Self Portrait review – picturing a titan of British art,"Detailing an epic social life as well as an obsession with painting himself in to his own works, this is a fascinating, if limited, overview",3,"The latest in the excellent Exhibition on Screen series is pinned to the current Lucian Freud: The Self Portraits show at the Royal Academy, which is due to end later this month. It’s really designed to fill in the gaps and provide context; a slightly purer form, perhaps, of the gallery film mini-genre we have got used to.Well, this film – with its subtly edited subtitle, A Self Portrait – is well up to standard: it takes us through Freud’s upbringing, education and early development as an artist, pointing out (naturally) his epic social life as well as his fervent dedication to painting. The film also takes advantage of interview material with the artist (who died in 2011) shot by his former assistant David Dawson, who also took the famous photograph of Freud painting a tiny picture of the Queen.Freud’s early work, with its precise outlines and mysterious symbolism, is given its due, though of course most of the attention is devoted to his thickly painted later masterworks, which reflect the artist’s own piercing gaze. (There’s a fascinating section devoted to Freud’s habit of painting himself almost invisibly into his pictures, via shadows, or mirrors, or indeed other self-portraits, as barely noticeable props.) There’s the usual informed comment from curatorial talking heads, one or two of whom ended up sitting for Freud; and the comparisons to Rembrandt, advanced at some length, don’t seem entirely overblown.If there’s a slight drawback, it’s that the remit of the format, which focuses on a single aspect of Freud’s work, ends up feeling a little narrow. There’s an unavoidable temptation to want to wander into areas not connected to self-portraiture. But there’s no harm in leaving the viewer wanting more.Lucian Freud: A Self Portrait is released in the UK on 14 January."
Lullaby review – a no-thrills thriller,A middle-class French family is terrorised by the nanny from hell in this contrived drama,2,"When Myriam (Leïla Bekhti) and her husband, Paul (Antoine Reinartz), employ the unflappable and serene Louise (Karin Viard) as the new nanny for their two children, they don’t anticipate how essential she will become to the smooth running of the household. And for her part, Louise embraces her status as honorary family member a little too eagerly. But while Louise is not all she seems, she’s not well written enough as a character to register as anything more than a string of button-pushing plot devices.This is crass and exploitative stuff that feels too contrived – despite the child peril, lingering shots of knives and the increasingly demented behaviour of Louise – to build much in the way of real tension. Viard does her best, but the credibility of the picture, as well as that of her character, is undermined somewhat by her frenzied attack against an imaginary octopus."
"La Dolce Vita review – a sexy, surreal masterpiece of modernity",Federico Fellini’s rereleased film brilliantly captures postwar Rome and its denizens as they tumble headlong into hedonistic excess – and secret melancholy,5,"For a dizzying moment in the disorientated postwar era, cinema and Federico Fellini put Rome at the centre of the world; now his early masterpiece from 1960, La Dolce Vita, is rereleased as part of a retrospective at London’s BFI Southbank to mark the 100th anniversary of his birth. It’s a film with Fellini’s genius for revealing dreamlike and surreal images everywhere, especially that extraordinary image of Christ being helicoptered over the city, apparently on its way to be delivered to the pope.The movie finds Rome in a hysterical, excitable but also somehow desperate mood – the mood of “Il Boom”, that economic and cultural revival in which Italy was euphorically eager to forget the catastrophe of fascism and defeat, and to start all over again, in a headlong rush of modernity and excitement: movies, music, fashion and style. It is as if Rome’s new contemporary sexiness and hedonism has revived the spirit of pre-Christian Rome and pagan ritual. But this coexists with a secret melancholy, a spiritual bust to go with the boom: ennui and fear.Marcello Mastroianni plays Marcello, a handsome and jaded gossip journalist who is a man about town, a night owl, a womaniser whose affairs drive his regular girlfriend Emma (Yvonne Furnaux) to despair. Most importantly, he is an habitué of the fashionable Via Veneto, where Hollywood and Italian movie stars are routinely surrounded by aggressive photographers; here is where Marcello’s own colleague, Paparazzo (Walter Santesso), gave the world a new word. (When Marcello addresses him crisply as “Paparazzo!” it now sounds accusing in an unintentional way.) For shooting nighttime scenes, Fellini created a gigantic full-scale replica of the Via Veneto at the Cinecittà studios, and Shawn Levy’s book about Rome in this period, Dolce Vita Confidential, amusingly describes how Fellini came to prefer his own artificial Via Veneto – larger, straighter – to the real thing.Marcello despises himself for having failed to write a novel, and he is actually acquainted with a serious and much-lauded writer known simply as Steiner (played by Alain Cuny), that name perhaps signalling a Mitteleuropaïsch seriousness at odds with Rome’s carefree world. It is Steiner who is to be the touchstone of Marcello’s fragile idealism, his sense that he might one day make something of himself; and it is Steiner’s awful fate that is to seal Marcello’s disillusion: especially the way the paparazzi behave around his widow.Is Marcello a damned soul? There is a whiff of sulphur in his relationship with Maddalena (Anouk Aimée), whose name perhaps recalls Mary Magdalene, especially when at the end of a long evening they go off together with a sex worker to her wretched apartment to have sex there, for the low-life thrills. (The woman hopes that Marcello might give her 2,000 lire in the morning; he does not.)Fellini contrives an amazing sequence when Marcello has to cover a spasm of religious hysteria when two children are reported to have had a vision of the Blessed Virgin: an impromptu media circus convenes as the sick and the disabled arrive en masse, hoping to be cured. And it is disturbing and even moving when Marcello’s handsome and roguish old father (Annibale Ninchi) arrives in Rome without warning and Marcello takes him for a night on the town; the older man charms the local young women, one of whom – to Marcello’s consternation and dismay – takes him home to her apartment.There is an excruciating and mortifying sequel as his father suffers some kind of medical crisis, brought on, we can only assume, by incautious exertion, or the prospect of exertion. Marcello has to come round to this woman’s place to get him a taxi – having already confessed to a friend that he doesn’t even know his father very well. He sees in him a picture of both his future and present self. (Paolo Sorrentino’s ageing journalist Jep in his 2013 film The Great Beauty, played by Toni Servillo, is in some way a conflation of Marcello and his father.) There is something so sad in it.An extended sequence in a 16th-century castle as the guest of a decadent and financially ruined aristocratic family is the prelude to a gloomy twilight of Marcello’s self-respect. It is a comparable, lugubrious mood that Antonioni found in his movie La Notte a year later. More parties lead to that strange beach confrontation with the fish, a sea monster that is a portent of disaster.La Dolce Vita is widely remembered for Marcello gallantly disporting himself in the Trevi fountain with the visiting Hollywood diva Sylvia (Anita Ekberg), a scene that might be simply too preposterous, were it not for the inspired ending that Fellini conjures. Suddenly, like a hard cut, night turns to morning, like awakening from a dream, and the pair are still fully clothed in the fountain, blinking in the daylight. Have they really been like that, all night, or is the whole thing a dream? And the press interview scene is bizarre, with Sylvia asked whether she prefers pyjamas or a nightgown, or if she thinks neorealism is dead.Like the interview scenes in Godard’s Breathless that same year, it shows a fascination with the theatre of celebrity. It is a brilliant film, but there is nothing sweet about it. La Dolce Vita is rereleased in the UK on 3 January."
Cleanin’ Up the Town: Remembering Ghostbusters review – slime time,The director and surviving stars revisit the groundbreaking supernatural comedy in an enjoyably geeky documentary,3,"If you’re a Ghostbusters superfan – and, for heaven’s sake, who isn’t? – then this amiably celebratory documentary about the original film is going to be pretty watchable, although it could have been cut down to 20 minutes as a featurette to go on the DVD/Blu-ray edition.There’s decent stuff here. The film enjoyably geeks out on the technical challenges involved in creating the ghosts, and there are nice interviews with director Ivan Reitman, veteran comedy producer Joe Medjuck and stars Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis (recorded before his death in 2014), Sigourney Weaver and Ernie Hudson. Unfortunately, no Bill Murray though. And another thing we don’t get is Ray Parker Jr’s legendary theme tune, presumably for copyright reasons.This has an interesting, detailed, technical story to tell about a film that was green-lit at Columbia in 1983 on the basis of Aykroyd’s original script and was in cinemas just one year later, having done some extraordinarily innovative effects and model work in a great surge of creativity (although I’ve always felt that the “slimer” surely owes something to Terry Gilliam). The location work in New York, enabled via arrangement with Mayor Ed Koch, was truly spectacular, and the colossal sets being built were no less humungous.Another person who is mentioned here, but not interviewed, is that once super-powerful agent-slash-producer and all-round éminence grise Michael Ovitz who was involved with Ghostbusters: a figure once as big and important as they come in Hollywood, but now almost forgotten. He’s someone who himself might make an excellent documentary subject. Cleanin’ Up the Town: Remembering Ghostbusters is released in the UK on 7 January."
We Are from Jazz review – zany Russian musical comedy,"In this entertaining fantasy from the Soviet era, a brilliant pianist is expelled from the music academy because of his passion for decadent American jazz",4,"Only in a Woody Allen film will you hear quite as much Dixieland jazz as this. Here is We Are from Jazz, or We Are Jazzmen, the zany jazz comedy musical from Russian director Karen Shakhnazarov, originally released in 1983, but now revived as part of the Melodia! festival of Russian musicals at London’s BFI Southbank and Ciné Lumière.Shakhnazarov is now a rather establishment figure in Putin’s Russia as director general of the official Mosfilm studios and supporter of the party line, but his breakthrough film showed him to be a sprightly, subversive, comic talent – a tweaker of authority’s nose. His story imagines the birth of jazz in the Soviet Union, and it has the spirit of Hollywood movies such as George Roy Hill’s The Sting or even Billy Wilder’s Some Like It Hot.Igor Skylar is Kostya, a brilliant young jazz pianist expelled from the music academy because jazz is emblematic of decadent American capitalism. Kostya tries valiantly to argue for the progressive, revolutionary credentials of jazz – the music of the African-American people, fighting against their white oppressor. But it is no good. So Kostya wanders the streets, recruiting street musicians for his band, and finds Stepan (Aleksandr Pankratov-Chyorny), Zhora (Nikolai Averyushkin), and Ivan (Pyotr Shcherbakov).Another kind of jazz musical might have concentrated on the picaresque adventures of our heroes, perhaps particularly their adventures in love; and it’s true that a beautiful singer called Katya (Yelena Tsyplakova) tries to tempt Kostya away from his pals to form a band with her. But this is more of an absurdist, bizarre, even existential jazz musical. The guys (they’re never that fussed about deciding on a name) keep worrying about jazz. What is jazz? What are they doing playing it? When will people understand and like jazz?With a sickeningly ironic inevitability, the Soviet authorities, having disliked jazz, are forming committees in which they will decide what kind of jazz is sufficiently pure. And there are uproarious, dreamlike scenes in which they get to play lavish concerts on expensive sets: one including a giant rotating LP disc.Kostya himself sounds like a mature Oscar Peterson. A very entertaining fantasy comedy."
In the Line of Duty review – race-against-time cop thriller,Troubled detective Aaron Eckhart is forced to team up with a young citizen journalist in this run-of-the-mill action spectacle,2,"There’s a straight-to-video feel to this cop thriller, directed by action veteran Steven C Miller, written by Jeremy Drysdale (who scripted the indie hit Grand Theft Parsons) and starring its exec producer, Aaron Eckhart.He plays Detective Frank Penny, a troubled but decent police officer with a reputation for shooting first and asking questions later. He accidentally ruins an anti-kidnap operation by killing the kidnapper who was about to pick up the ransom money in a public square, and now it’s a race against time to find out where the hostage is being held before she dies. And this tough, old-school cop finds himself having to tolerate a young citizen journalist, Ava Brooks (Courtney Eaton), who tags along, live streaming the whole thing on her phone, thus putting in place the ingredients for an odd-couple situation with both people involved learning to respect and like each other.I have to admit there is a good chase sequence at the beginning, with Penny on the run as his culprit sprints away through the city, bashing into everything but a cart piled high with oranges. However, from there on, it becomes a pretty much generic and almost plotless action spectacle, with people forever being thrown on to car windshields that duly splinter, squad cars pirouetting through the air, and an old-fashioned, hanging-off-a-helicopter routine – although the Mission: Impossible franchise makes all this look bargain-basement.It’s amiable, but the real action thrills and the chemistry between the leads isn’t there. In the Line of Duty is released in the UK on 3 January."
Cats review – a purr-fectly dreadful hairball of woe,The queasy fears prompted by one of the most disturbing movie trailers ever seen are realised in full in Tom Hooper’s jaw-dropping feline folly,1,"‘A furry orgy in a dumpster’: what the reviews say about CatsThe filming of Cats is a difficult matter,It isn’t just one of your holiday games,Each actor involved here looks mad as a hatter,When the trailer came out, we were CALLING THEM NAMES.It began with Cat poems from old TS Eliot,In the 80s, Lloyd Webber just put them on stageThat was frankly a bit of a gamble for Andrew, butCoach-loads of punters made Cats all the rage.Now Cats is on film, with many a lonely pussPlayed by performers of A-lister class.But the number of mammaries looks frankly erroneousAnd tails that appear to emerge from each arse.There are lots of big names here, names we see daily,Names that supposedly give us a lift.Nothing like Jonathan Pie or Bill Bailey,But names like James Corden, and – yes – Taylor Swift.The setting is London, it does look post-nuclearThere aren’t any people, so maybe there wereBomb blasts – or maybe a bio disasterCausing cat-human mutants with digital fur.The twitching of ears on their heads is distractingAs they gaze at the greenscreen and sashay and crawl,It’s weird to behold them all gurning and acting,And why do so many resemble Darth Maul?Did director Tom Hooper intend this appearance?Did it make him feel happy – or cause him some stress?We have to assume that he gave it his clearanceBut THE MAN HIMSELF KNOWS and will never confess.These are the Jellicle felines of legend,All elbows and shoulders and undulant arms.Each male in the cast looks a bit of a bellend,And those bizarre whiskers don’t add to their charms.The Jellicles welcome Victoria: a new cat,Francesca Hayward’s the thesp with this role,She’s sleek, unlike Corden – well known for TV chatBut it’s his size that reveals that he’s meant to be droll.And then Idris Elba comes on as McCavity,(A boomy-voiced villain in anyone’s book)There’s a prominent gap in his penis locality.I honestly didn’t … well … know where to look.As Grizabella, Jennifer Hudson will sniffleSinging Memory, this movie’s moment of truth.But it’s warbling warbling warbling piffleFrom a bag lady drama-queen obsessed with lost youth.The Jellicles’ leader is Old DeuteronomyJudi Dench has this part, looking very bemused.What’s with that extra big fur coat?

The Courier review – dreary action-thriller fails to deliver,"After saving the life of a trial witness, biker Olga Kurylenko goes on the run from Gary Oldman’s super-dull supervillain",1,"Michael Caine once said that he had never seen the awful Jaws 4 in which he appeared, and added: “But I’ve seen the house it bought for my mum. It’s fantastic!’ What, you wonder, has Oscar-winning actor Gary Oldman bought with his fee for doing this terrible action-thriller, with its range of bad acting, ropey production values and stock footage of cityscape exteriors? Can’t we see that instead? Can’t we have 99 minutes of Gary taking us on a tour of his micro-winery in northern California? Or showing us the sumptuous leather interior of his BMW?Oldman plays Ezekiel Mannings, a supervillainous evil mastermind in a luxurious Manhattan apartment with an eyepatch and a love of classical music, often listening to an LP with eyes closed and an evil smile playing about his thin lips. Woe betide the cringing henchman or cowering underling who has to interrupt this reverie to stammeringly report that the key prosecution witness in a case against him has not in fact been murdered, as per his express instructions.What has happened is that a sexy, badass, leather-clad motorbike courier (Olga Kurylenko) – unintriguingly known simply as “the courier” – had been tricked into delivering a package containing a poison-gas bomb into the secure room where this witness had been holed up. But the witness gets away with the courier’s help and now they are both on the run, while details of their continued survival are periodically conveyed to Mr Mannings, and he is terribly cross about it.Oldman delivers his lines with a strange lethargy and tonelessness, as if – just before speaking – he has just realised that income tax will have to be deducted from his fee. The Courier is released in the UK on 20 December."
Ip Man 4 review – kung fu master gives America a kicking,"In the solemn fourth film about the real-life martial arts teacher, Ip Man takes on a racist bully in the US marine corps",2,"Donnie Yen returns for his last coolly impassive outing as the real-life Chinese martial artist and wing chun master Ip Man, who trained generations of kung fu students, Bruce Lee being the most famous.In this final, faintly solemn episode, Ip is a widower, growing old, and has been given a diagnosis of cancer. We see him leave Hong Kong and make a journey to the United States in the 1960s (where his great student Lee is already making a name for himself) on a mission to find a private school for his tearaway young son. (In fact, the real Ip made no such journey.)Ip finds a great deal of anti-Chinese racism from white Americans, and from his fellow Chinese he finds hostility and resentment towards Lee for teaching wing chun to foreigners.On a nearby marine corps camp, the military have a profound suspicion of kung fu, preferring the all-American practice of karate – the film leaves it to us to notice the irony of espousing something Japanese, although it’s weirdly not clear if we’re supposed to notice it.Finally, Ip Man, although ailing and no longer young, is asked to face off with an overbearing racist bully: gunner sergeant Geddes, played by the British martial arts star Scott Adkins. Quite a contest.Given that a fair amount of creative licence has been exercised here, it is strange that Bruce Lee has such a small part to play: a cameo at the karate contest at the beginning, a chat with Ip, but then he recedes into the shadows. Perhaps the movie can’t handle more than one martial arts legend at a time. It would be like bringing Miss Marple into a Hercule Poirot story. Ip Man 4 is released in Australia on 20 December and in the UK and the US on 25 December."
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker review – death is not the end in new trilogy's laborious exit,Some familiar – and some surprising – franchise favourites return for a final fling in JJ Abrams’s whoppingly comprehensive galaxy quest,3,"As one of the greatest sagas in cinema history reaches its climax, it’s concerning that Star Wars has lately been generating more drama off screen than on. There’s been the personnel changes (original director Colin Trevorrow left after “creative differences”, prompting the return of JJ Abrams). Then there was the fact that this instalment’s predecessor, Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi, took the story to surprising new places and left a lot of questions unanswered.Some fans were left confused; a nastier contingent railed against its so-called “identity politics”. Even some of the actors have admitted their doubts about The Last Jedi – John Boyega recently described it as “feeling a bit iffy”. Add in the fact that this instalment has to cap off a 42-year trilogy of trilogies, and that Baby Yoda from spin-off series The Mandalorian has outshone any character in the movies in terms of public affection, and this has more work to do than it ought to.Given that there is no possible way of pleasing all the people even half the time when it comes to Star Wars, the good news is, The Rise of Skywalker is the send-off the saga deserves. The bad news is, it is largely the send-off we expected. Of course there is epic action to savour and surprises and spoilers to spill, but given the long, long build-up, some of the saga’s big revelations and developments might be a little unsatisfying on reflection.We’re given little time to think about that though: the story gets moving quickly and barely pauses for breath. The Resistance gang is all brought together swiftly, including a cut-and-pasted Carrie Fisher, and in short measure they’re off in the Millennium Falcon on a kind of galaxy-trotting treasure-hunt, told in quick, efficient strokes. The central characters – Daisy Ridley’s Rey, Oscar Isaac’s Poe, John Boyega’s Finn, and good old Chewbacca (who gets a bit more to do this time), establish an easy, seriocomic camaraderie that makes you wish they’d spent more time together on screen.Their whistle-stop tour is fleshed out with action set-pieces, new characters and locations, and plenty of attractive visual detail in the margins. There’s so much plotting and exposition, it feels like two movies condensed into one at times, and there is little downtime in which to really get into any character depth but Abrams’ knack for efficient storytelling and the odd visual flourish carries it along, at least to the half-way point.As for the Dark Side, it is no secret that Ian McDiarmid’s old-school Sith lord Emperor Palpatine is back in the frame, along with Adam Driver’s conflicted Kylo Ren, whose cracked mask hints all too obviously at his bruised inner turmoil. But then Rey has her issues too. She is kind to abused droids and injured snake monsters, but there are question marks over her morality too, as hinted at at in the trailer’s much-discussed inclusion of a “dark Rey”.Ren and Rey’s mysterious connection has been the most intriguing aspect of the new trilogy. Here, it unfolds in a series of teases and false starts that almost border on wearisome, though there are hints of ambiguity and even eroticism to it. Let’s just hope they don’t turn out to be brother and sister this time. As with the original Star Wars trilogy, there is just enough in this dynamic to muddy up the simplistic good-versus-evil themes, although this latest trilogy has been as much about hope versus fear, which is where it could possibly strike a contemporary chord.The big questions get answered, but cannot be discussed further, for the time being. Let’s just say some old Star Wars traditions die hard. As do old Star Wars characters. There are so many returning old faces in this movie, you start to wonder if anyone ever actually dies and stays dead in this far-away galaxy. But if you’re going to do a send-off this huge, there are a lot of goodbyes to say, and a lot of loose ends to tie up. The fact that The Rise of Skywalker manages most of them and within a vaguely coherent story is something of an achievement in itself. This vast, hulking Star Destroyer of a franchise has become too cumbersome to pull off any genuinely nimble manoeuvres, but at the same time, it never falls out of the sky. Partly that’s a simple matter of momentum, but it is also a question of faith. Over its long history, Star Wars has acquired a mythic grandeur few movie franchises can ever hope to match. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker opens on 19 December in the UK and 20 December in the US"
Pink Wall review – time travellers on romance's rocky road,Director Tom Cullen reshuffles events in an intimate drama about how the messiness of life jeopardises a new relationship,3,"Tom Cullen is the actor who had his breakthrough in Andrew Haigh’s contemporary romantic drama Weekend in 2011; now he makes an interesting and worthwhile debut as writer-director with Pink Wall, an intimate, scenes-from-a-relationship movie. We see various moments from various years in the time that a certain troubled couple are together, and the reshuffling of the narrative order somehow accentuates the poignant entropy as things fall apart.Jay Duplass plays Leon, an amiable, unambitious American guy in London with vague plans to become a photographer, but who likes hanging out in his flat cooking, listening to music and smoking weed, generally savouring the solo mood of directionless creativity and fun. (There’s a moment when, slightly loopy from solitude, he self-satirically calls out “Lovely balloons!” at something he’s seen out of the window and bursts out laughing. I did, too.)Leon falls in love with Jenna, who is exactly wrong for him or maybe exactly right. She is a formidably smart, professionally driven TV producer played by Tatiana Maslany, renowned for her bravura multi-personality performance in the BBC America sci-fi thriller Orphan Black, and with whom Cullen acted in a comparable film from 2016 called The Other Half. Jenna might herself have feelings for her best female friend that she has never entirely dealt with, and which get buried by the reality of this new heterosexual situation with Leon.Cullen shows that their entire relationship might stem from Jenna’s unexpressed gratitude for the piercingly important insight that Leon had into Jenna at the very beginning of their life together when they were just living a studenty existence, with no idea of the future. Leon tells Jenna that with her fierce focus and talent for organising people and making things happen, she should be a producer. And he is right. Inevitably, her career takes off, but he is becalmed, and issues about sexuality, monogamy and children become more difficult and painful.Perhaps the biggest moment of the film comes at the very beginning when, some way into their relationship, Leon and Jenna go out for a pub lunch with her mum and brother – the conversation is barrelling along pretty nicely and then takes a sudden, unexpected left turn. Duplass shows how Leon has been taken aback by something said and Maslany turns her character’s behaviour on a sixpence from cordiality to something very different.The faultline has been laid open for us. And the rest of the scene plays out in a break-up/make-up structure that is confidently presented by Maslany and Duplass but repeats elsewhere in the film, and is indicative of something slightly actor-ish about the drama.That isn’t to say there aren’t many great touches. I loved Leon and Jenna’s relationship opening up to the ecstatic accompaniment of the Meters’ song Cissy Strut and Leon’s spacey interpretation of the music. And cinematographer Bobby Shore has an interesting closeup on Maslany in a party scene when Leon is regaling everyone with a bizarre anecdote about when he was a kid and was trying to look at his own anus in the bathroom with the help of a mirror and his dad walked in on him.Leon plays it as an outrageously and obviously funny story, but the shot of Jenna’s fractionally uncertain smile tells us something more complicated. Has she heard that anecdote before? Does she entirely like the performative side of Leon here? Has she, in fact, picked up on something that Leon doesn’t entirely realise: that this anecdote is part of a carefully curated and edited story about his relationship with his father, which was actually very unhappy?And so the drama zigzags back and forth along the timeline, culminating in a powerful exchange taking place on an outdoor hike. With some self-consciousness, Leon makes what he considers to be a lovely, relationship-saving gesture, intended to bring about what he (and we, the audience) might assume is the imminent happy ending. But that is not how it pans out, and I admired how Cullen tries to absorb the uncinematic messiness of real life.Pink Wall can be a bit contrived at times, with situations that have been rather effortfully created. But there are strong, forthright performances from Maslany and Duplass as the lovers who were never meant to be. Pink Wall is released in the UK on 13 December."
Jumanji: The Next Level review – Dwayne Johnson ups his comedy game,"The old gang re-enter the video game fantasy world for more body-swap hijinks and Indiana Jones-ish adventures, and Johnson levels-up his comedy stylings",3,"Jumanji is back, activating the time-honoured sequel device of bringing in character actors from the older grandparent generation. It is showing every sign of becoming a very solid family-movie franchise, cheerfully drawing once more on the traditions of Indiana Jones and the body-swap movies of yesteryear. And there is once again a really nice quadrophonic chemistry between its four stars: Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Karen Gillan and Jack Black (joined by more big names this time around), and the odd-couple comedy bonding of Hart and Johnson. (A noticeable flaw is that Black does not get much of a chance to demonstrate his comedy chops.)In the previous instalment of the franchise, four high-school kids, Bethany (Madison Iseman), Spence (Alex Wolff), Martha (Morgan Turner) and Fridge (Ser’Darius Blain), were catapulted into the VR world of the Jumanji video game, occupying avatars on a mission to rescue someone trapped inside its colossal invented landscape. And Spence got to exist inside the body of alpha-male explorer Dr Smoulder Bravestone, amusingly played by Johnson – an experience that allowed him to escape his wimpy-nerdishness, value himself for who he is, and learn that it’s what inside that counts.Now, a couple of years have gone by, the quartet are at college and things aren’t quite as happy as we might have hoped. Spence is at NYU, lonely, stressed and pining for his bygone triumph in the imaginary world of Jumanji. Without his three friends realising it, he has retrieved the Jumanji game console and has once again made a desperate leap into the digital rabbit-hole. It looks as if the remaining three will have to leap in after him – but now we make the acquaintance of Spence’s crotchety but good-natured grandpa Eddie, played by Danny DeVito, and Eddie’s old codger pal Milo, played by Danny Glover. Through a weird quirk of fate, it is Fridge and Martha who re-enter Jumanji, bizarrely accompanied by wacky old Eddie and Milo, with Bethany left behind, to search out the object of their original quest: Alex, played in the real world by Colin Hanks and in the game by Nick Jonas. They too will wind up in this fantasy universe.So the question of who plays who has been reshuffled and suffice it to say DeVito’s grumpy, pernickety, wisecracking old dude now occupies the mighty body of Johnson – giving Johnson a chance to show his comedy stylings, and pretty impressive they are. It is rare in the literal-minded world of Hollywood (in any genre) to let an actor show off in this theatrical way. As for Glover’s laidback Milo, he occupies the body of zoologist Moose Finbar, played by Hart – and Hart is funny in more or less the way he would have been anyway. Martha is once again biologist Ruby Roundhouse and Fridge is annoyed to find himself inside Jack Black’s body. And where is Spence? Whose body does he inhabit? Well, this is a casting reveal, and it would be unsporting to say more, but more performance comedy ensues.What gives Jumanji its likability is that it has the emphases and comedy beats of an animation, but also the performance technique of live action – and the occasional reshuffling of avatars and players lets the actors show off a little bit further. Jumanji’s next level is rather satisfying. Perhaps the next Jumanji film will experiment with an “acoustic unplugged” version which takes place solely in the real world, or a dark version in which Martha becomes a hip games designer who introduces a Battle Royale element. But my prediction is that fans would be perfectly happy with another episode on the same lines as before.Released in the UK on 11 December, in the US 13 December, and in Australia on 26 December."
Bombshell review – Fox News abuse drama pulls its hardest punches,Roger Ailes’ victims fight back in a film where the odious media mogul looms large … before Rupert Murdoch saves the day,3,"The loathsome Roger Ailes, notorious as a former Nixon apparatchik and veteran CEO of the stridently mediocre Fox News channel, became even less fragrant in 2016 when the open secret of his sexual harassment became an open non-secret. The channel’s former anchor Gretchen Carlson successfully filed a lawsuit against him, revealing that he made sexual advances to her and other women at Fox; their careers would be advanced (or cancelled) at his seedy whim. Carlson’s courageous lawsuit was supported by six other women and the 76-year-old Ailes’s own boss, Rupert Murdoch, fired his underling, who died a year later.This gruesome soap opera of misogyny and reactionary politics has already been turned into a Showtime TV drama, The Loudest Voice, with Naomi Watts as Carlson and Russell Crowe as Ailes – and now it is a movie directed by Jay Roach and written by Charles Randolph, with Nicole Kidman as Carlson and John Lithgow horribly plausible and latexed up as her bloated old sex-criminal employer. Charlize Theron is Fox News presenter Megyn Kelly, who infuriated the Fox News fanbase by challenging Trump on his anti-women attitudes before the election, and Margot Robbie plays Kayla Pospisil, a fictional composite of all the younger women who were abused. She is the “Christian influencer” on Instagram who figures she can get ahead at Fox, and submits, almost in a dream, to the humiliation required.It is a strange film in some ways, speckled with powerful, insightful moments but also with some strained acting, pulled punches and fudged attitudes, unable to decide if its heroines are compromised through having been loyal Fox staffers. Ailes is the obvious villain but Murdoch (still alive, with lawyers and power in the media world) is almost presented as the good guy, finally intervening to create a happy ending and played in cameo by Malcolm McDowell. Despite the film’s title, the Carlson/Ailes lawsuit was not a bombshell in the way the Harvey Weinstein revelations were a year later. This may have been because Ailes’s accuser was no feminist, and was for years fully on board with the aggressively boorish and sexist attitudes of Fox News.As for Kelly, the film uses some narrative sleight of hand to suggest that she joined forces with Carlson, when it fact she appears to have limited her support to reporting her own harassment from Ailes in an internal investigation.Where Bombshell succeeds is in showing how the predatory and sinister abuse plays out in the corporate environment – in bullying. The film shows that sexual harassment and bullying are not separate issues but part of the continuum of coercion. It sketches out a queasy scenario in which a younger female journalist is taken out for a drink by a male boss who brutally asks for sex in return for career advancement, and the film shows how the aghast woman’s instinct is to forgive this man, to pretend it isn’t happening, even to apologise: “I’m sorry if I’ve given you the impression that our relationship could be anything but professional…”Carlson and Kelly are the male-bully victims and there is a truly toe-curling scene in which Carlson, already demoted to an afternoon slot for complaining about on-air bantz from her grisly male co-hosts, presents a “no cosmetics” show. Ailes crassly blunders into the studio and shouts at her in front of the crew, screaming that no one wants to see a middle-aged woman sweating. Humiliated, Carlson can only riposte: “Thank you for the advice!” — and Kidman powerfully shows her rage.I found Theron’s performance as Kelly a little studied and mannered, but again she powerfully shows the same power dynamic. When male inadequates no longer find a woman in the workplace attractive or susceptible to condescension, they bully and demean her, and Ailes revoltingly allowed Donald Trump to do this to Kelly via Twitter, partly because Trump was a ratings star and partly because Ailes not-so-secretly agreed with the future president. The unexpressed irony of this movie is that the president, a serial non-respecter of women, detonated his own explosion of cynical bigotry. The rubble has yet to be cleared away."
Lucy in the Sky review – earthbound tale of an obsessed astronaut,Natalie Portman shines but Noah Hawley’s fact-based drama lacks the right stuff,2,"Natalie Portman stars in a drama that is loosely based on the case of Lisa Nowak, the Nasa astronaut who was disgraced after attacking the girlfriend of her ex-lover. The feature debut from Noah Hawley pushes the idea that, once someone has ventured into space, readjusting to life back on Earth can be a struggle. This theme – of an all-consuming job that bends everything else out of shape – has been explored more successfully before, by Kathryn Bigelow’s The Hurt Locker and by Portman herself in Darren Aronofsky’s Black Swan, among others.Here, however, there are tonal issues. Neither as coolly observational as The Hurt Locker nor as stridently bonkers as Black Swan, Lucy in the Sky is low on real insight and feels like a psychology column in a supermarket tabloid. Portman gives her all, but she out-classes this rather pedestrian telling of a story of stratospheric levels of obsession and ambition."
Invasion Planet Earth review – ludicrously ambitious low-cost sci-fi,"A suburban London psychiatrist and his patients are kidnapped by aliens in this clunky, on-a-budget adventure",2,"This UK-produced apocalyptic science-fiction yarn looks as if it was made with just enough budget to cover a couple of lights, petrol, the delightfully clunky visual effects – the digital equivalent of sticky-back plastic and pipe cleaners – and a few sandwiches for the cast and crew. But props are due to writer-director Simon Cox, the several dozen producers credited and cast and crew who sunk time, money and effort to make something so ludicrously ambitious with such meagre means, even if the end result is markedly uneven.The main protagonist is Tom Dunn (Simon Haycock), a psychiatrist living in the London suburbs with his school-teacher wife Mandy (Lucy Drive), who has just discovered she’s pregnant. This is bittersweet news for the couple who are still grieving the death a few years earlier of their small daughter, but both are trying to be hopeful and positive. That’s going to be needed because it looks as if the world is on the brink of war and aliens have invaded. The extraterrestrials kidnap Tom and a handful of his most eccentric patients, setting on them off on bizarre adventures seemingly engineered to make them confront their deepest fears and traumas.It’s not entirely clear if these head games from another planet have good or ill intentions, but one thing is clear: they must have been watching a lot of vintage sci-fi, especially the Terminator and Matrix franchises, judging by their taste in spaceship interior design. The performances, apart from those of the lead actors, are often painfully stiff, but presumably the cast had to do a lot of reacting to tennis balls on sticks in green-screen studios. That’s hard work for sure. Invasion Planet Earth is released in the UK on 5 December."
"So Long, My Son review – exquisite, agonising Chinese family saga","The epic story of two married couples enduring personal tragedy and state-imposed suffering is an almost unbearably poignant, profound masterpiece",5,"Wang Xiaoshuai navigates an ocean of sadness in this film. It can finally be watched only through a blur of tears and with a terrible, futile need to reach into the screen and hug the two ageing lead characters. So Long, My Son is an epic generational drama of two families in China, from the 1980s to the present day; directed and shot with clarity and calm, audaciously structured in terms of flashback and flashforward – and acted superbly.There is also touch of melodrama in it, if such a thing can be said to exist in the unshowy walking pace of Wang’s storytelling style, with some influences from classic Japanese family drama perhaps, and gestures of soap-operatic melancholy, largely in the repeated (and unexpected) use of the plaintive tune Auld Lang Syne. This is a film that doesn’t signpost its relevant facts very emphatically and you have to stay alert for shifts in the timeline, and for important details that are only revealed later. But, once you have mentally readjusted away from traditional linear expectations, this movie opens up like a flower.It is about the terrible burden of grief, rage and guilt, and the greater burden of forgiveness; it is also about an emotional wound that only gets worse with the years. That wound has been inflicted on two levels: by the ordinary, arbitrary heartbreak of life and by the malign agencies of the Chinese state, with its draconian one-child policy to control population and boost economic growth, begun in the late 70s and not completely abandoned until 2015.Liyun (Yong Mei) and Yaojun (Wang Jingchun) are an obedient, hardworking married couple in the big city with an eight-year-old boy Xingxing. Their best friends are fellow factory hands Haiyan (Liya Ai) and her husband, who have an eight-year-old son of their own, Haohao; their kids are best friends. But, when Liyun gets pregnant with an (illicit) second child, she discovers just how much of an apparatchik party-zealot her friend and neighbour Haiyan actually is. She reports Liyun to the authorities and gets her dragged off to the hospital for an abortion she doesn’t want, while Yaojun impotently rages at the government and at himself for failing to stand up for Liyun. And then Haohao boisterously chivvies and bullies Xingxing into going swimming at a dangerous reservoir with the other, wilder neighbourhood kids, despite Xingxing’s timid complaints that he can’t swim. The catastrophic result (all the more painful for never being explicitly shown) inflicts a crippling psychic blow to all four adults and to Haohao, who is to grow up with a need to go into the medical profession and save lives.As the new millennium dawns, fate provides a new twist to the suppressed guilt suffered by Haiyan and her family by making them wealthy in the new Chinese world of adventure. Meanwhile, wretched, lonely Liyun and Yaojun move away, to a remote coastal town where they adopt a boy, Xing (Roy Wang), who senses that he is second-best and becomes a tearaway delinquent, breaking his adoptive parents’ already shattered hearts. Moreover, Haohao’s glamorous aunt Moli (Xi Qi) forms a tendresse for Yaojun, which creates its own refinement of pain.At the centre of the film are the wonderfully compassionate and tender performances from Yong Mei and Wang Jingchun as the ageing, lonely pair whose unexpressed agony, by the end of this film, feels unbearably intimate. For me, the tragedy of their relationship is revealed in the closing act when they return to their hometown, grey old little country mice that they now are, silently goggling at all the glitzy new buildings and video ad hoardings – signs of that commercial triumph that the one-child policy was there to deliver.Yaojun appears to wave cheerily at something outside the car. It turns out to be a statue of Mao waving, almost dwarfed amid the steel and glass, and Yaojun turns his placid smile at his wife as if to explain: that is what I was waving back to, you see? Isn’t it silly? And how absurd to shed a tear now after all this time?Apart from everything else, this film reveals a terrible, simple truth: those who have endured the terrible agony of losing a child are not a separate tribe (that is: separate from the luckier ones) destined or earmarked for tragedy from the beginning. Neither are they people who have endured this blow in return for the expectation of some mysterious compensatory gift from the cosmos. Their fate is arbitrary and they are just like us; our current happiness used to be theirs.So Long, My Son is a piercingly, profoundly moving picture that peels and exposes the senses. So Long, My Son is released in the UK on 6 December."
Human Nature review – quiet revolution that began in a yoghurt pot,"An engrossing documentary about Crispr, a breakthrough in molecular biology with enormous implications for treating genetic diseases",4,"This documentary from writer-director Adam Bolt and co-writer Regina Sobel is about a revolution that has been quietly taking place in molecular biology and medicine: a revolution compared here to the invention of the internet but gaining a fraction of the attention. (The more pertinent comparison may be with nuclear energy.) It is the innovation of gene editing and Crispr (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats), a crucial pattern of DNA sequences in micro-organisms that allows them to resist viral infection by replicating a section of the virus’s DNA and using it as a kind of “wanted” poster to fight off the invader.This mechanism can be used to cut, copy and replace pieces of DNA – to “edit” it, like changing a piece of written text – and the technology has enormous implications for treating genetic diseases. Incredibly, it appears to have been developed first not by academic researchers or biotech geniuses, but a yoghurt and cheese manufacturer. Philippe Horvath and Rodolphe Barrangou of the food firm Danisco developed Crispr while figuring out how to make their product less susceptible to bacteria.Now Crispr is opening up exciting new avenues of medical thinking but at the same time reopening the debate on eugenics and the ethical implications of altering DNA, particularly the “germline” DNA that theoretically modifies your children’s genetic makeup. The film is at its most intriguing in its earlier half, when it simply takes you through the growing excitement within the scientific community as the reality of Crispr emerges.Once we get to the later sections debating the various qualms, with archive clips of Aldous Huxley discussing his novel Brave New World and of Jeff Goldblum in the movie Jurassic Park, the film becomes less interesting. The technology is excitingly new, but the debate isn’t. Rightly or wrongly, this film ends on a note dismissing worries as overblown moral panic.The one thing it doesn’t do is produce the pro-Crispr Shakespeare quotation – Polixenes from The Winter’s Tale, defending the practice of crossbreeding flowers to create blooms like carnations: “This is an art / Which does mend nature, change it rather, but / The art itself is nature.” Human Nature is released in the UK on 6 December."
"Koko: A Red Dog Story review – meta-mockumentary is maddening, but hard to resist",What should be a delightful romp about a famous dog blends fact and fiction so thoroughly it may end up breaking your brain,3,"That beloved Australian pooch Red Dog is back! Well, kind of. Sort of. Maybe? It’s complicated.By “Red Dog” I am not actually referring to the legendarily gregarious canine – the subject of multiple books and two hugely successful Australian films, who was so treasured in the Pilbara region in Western Australia that a statue was erected in his honour.I am instead referring to Koko, one of the dog actors who played Red Dog in the first movie, to whom the sequel Red Dog: True Blue was dedicated.Koko’s life – which ended in 2012 – is the topic of Koko: A Red Dog Story, a sassy and energetic third and final outing which playfully explores the unconditional love offered by dogs and the emotional impact they have on humans.Co-directors Aaron McCann and Dominic Pearce open with the narrator (Jason Isaacs, best-known as Lucius Malfoy in the Harry Potter films) putting all human achievements within perspective: “Fire, the wheel, the silicon chip – all very impressive,” he says. “But the single greatest thing to happen to the human race is the evolution of the domestic dog.”In direct-to-cam interviews, Kriv Stenders (director of the first two Red Dog films), Carol Hobday (Koko’s breeder and first human parent) and Nelson Woss (producer of all three films and Koko’s key human during his later years) reminisce about their titular old pal in ways one would associate with a human, setting in motion a film that treats its love for pooches very seriously – but in endearing, tongue-in-cheek ways.“He was very driven, incredibly focused,” says Stenders. “A star,” adds Woss. And “a brat – just like a normal child,” according to Hobday, who later amusingly recalls how Koko apparently got a big head after winning his first championship, leading him to “to strut around the town as if he owned the place.”If you watch the film without watching the trailer, Koko: A Red Dog Story looks like a documentary, sounds like a documentary, and, erm, barks like a documentary – albeit with semi-fictitious elements, including reenactment scenes where Stenders, Hobday and Woss are are played by actors (and Koko is played by a lookalike, Hero).But the trailer – and the press notes – presents it as something different altogether: a Christopher Guest-style film or, as the press notes put it, “a fictionalised take on real-life events shot in a documentary style”, and “the Spinal Tap or Exit Through the Gift Shop of dog movies”. Herein lies the problem: it’s not quite a mockumentary either.The film is a highly spirited and thoroughly entertaining love letter to doggos in general, and one loveable pooch in particular, but thanks to the appearance of and testimonies from the real people involved in this dog’s life, it blends fact and fiction in a way that came close to breaking my brain: were the segments I was particularly moved by – including a portion examining Koko’s showdog career, and an intense emotional moment late in the piece – true to life or tall tales (tails?).A conversation with the producer assured me that those moments were fundamentally truthful – but some details were made up, and they’re hard to distinguish from the others: Koko was never in the running for a role in Fury Road; never went on a press tour overseas; and never jumped through a glass window.It seems it’s best to think of A Red Dog Story as a feature film presented in a documentary style – but one which, unlike mockumentaries, is based on truth.The Red Dog series has always involved capturing and embellishing a legend, so perhaps the unusual approach is justified. The most pleasant surprise in the first sequel, Red Dog: True Blue, was its meta qualities; it even began with characters visiting the cinema to watch the original movie, before evolving into a bedtime yarn with a A Princess Bride-esque flashback narrative. McCann and Pearce get meta in different ways, jumping between interview footage, re-enactments, home videos and news footage.But the details of Koko’s real life were clearly rich enough for the directors to embrace without complicating it with small and immaterial lies. And it is hard to see the point; it feels like the audience may be getting punk’d for no good reason. It’s not operating on the same level, for instance, as Martin Scorsese’s recent (and historically inaccurate) quasi-documentary Rolling Thunder Revue, which is a film about putting on performances and wearing masks.Yet Koko: A Red Dog Story is hard to resist. At the risk of conjuring a sentence that will inflame the centuries-long war between canines and felines, it is certain to be catnip for dog lovers. A general, playful wholesomeness ensconces the film, which arrives in Australian cinemas very much an underdog – against stiff competition in the form of Frozen 2 and the new The Addams Family.Despite the confusion, I’m rooting for Red Dog. Or Koko. Or one of the dog actors who played Koko. Like I said, it’s complicated. Koko: A Red Dog Story is in Australian cinemas from 5 December"
Proceder review – the life and crimes of a Polish rap star,This biopic of the late Tomasz Chada recreates his onstage charisma effectively but his relentless bad behaviour makes him hard to like,2,"Like so many other biopics of musicians from the wrong side of the ring road, this dramatisation of the life of Polish rapper Tomasz Chada wants to find a redemptive moral in the morass of biographical material. The problem is, Chada’s storyline is thin on salvation, given he was an enthusiastic car thief (until prison slowed down his long career in crime), a committed consumer of drugs and alcohol, and an all round toerag to most of the people in his life, including the many women who tried to reform him, and the producer buddy who gave him a big break. Nevertheless, true to his inner good Catholic Polish boy child, he loved his mum and longed for her affection and approval – even though he sort of craps on her, too.He is played by Piotr Witkowski, whose feline eyes, eat-you-up grin and loping gait give Chada a charisma that helps you sort of see the appeal. His gritty raps about the mean streets of Warsaw and his life of crime – the usual fodder for hip-hop dirty realism the world over – are presumably sufficiently impressive in Polish to have won him an audience big enough to warrant this biopic in the first place. But it’s a rocky eight-kilometre road, and the bizarre narrative sleight of hand that the script pulls two thirds in feels like a convoluted way to pony up the redemption hit that audiences crave – one that maybaffle Chada fans who know what happened to their hero. Proceder is released in the UK on 29 November."
"The Biggest Little Farm review – The Good Life, California style","A lovingly made documentary about a couple who move out of LA to farm the land using traditional, environmentally friendly methods",3,"Those interested in farming, adorable animals and environmentally friendly lifestyles will swoon over this lovingly made documentary made by John and Molly Chester, a pair of Los Angeles-based workers from the media salt mines who upped sticks and bought a farm.John is a director-cinematographer specialising in wildlife photography, and Molly a chef and food blogger interested in rediscovering traditional farming methods as opposed to the large-scale, pesticide-intensive agriculture that’s highly profitable but ravishes the land. With advice and guidance from biodynamic farming guru Alan York, they bring a large plot with mostly avocado and lemon trees on a dusty sod of exhausted soil back to life, farming a wide variety of fruits and flocks of chickens and ducks whose eggs go down a storm with foodies.Over the nearly 10 years covered in the film they expand into sheep, cows, and an endearing sow who becomes best buddies with a greasy-looking rooster, all of which John films with great skill and empathy. But it’s to the film’s credit that it doesn’t just become a self-congratulatory, highly professional home movie; Chester responsibly explores the downside and many challenges inherent in their agrarian methods. The couple have to decide whether they should go to war with the coyotes when their fowl flocks are decimated; meanwhile, their pro-diversity approach duly stimulates the bird and mammal population but that also means damaged fruit crops. Then there’s the growing threat from wildfires.Ultimately, the film opts to accentuate the positive to an almost annoying extent, with sappy backing music and TV-doc-style production values; and some might wonder how exactly, for instance, they managed to raise enough to move out of a Santa Monica apartment and then suddenly buy what looks like a sizeable chunk of real estate. But, like Isabella Tree’s inspiring memoir Wilding, about the rehabilitation of the West Sussex Knepp estate, this might just inspire some to go full on Tom and Barbara Good and get back to nature. The Biggest Little Farm is released in the UK on 29 November."
1917 review – Sam Mendes turns western front horror into a single-shot masterpiece,This phantasmagoric first world war nightmare from the British director is ambitious and unshakeable storytelling,5,"Sam Mendes’s 1917 is an amazingly audacious film; as exciting as a heist movie, disturbing as a sci-fi nightmare. Working with co-writer Krysty Wilson-Cairns, he has created a first world war drama of the Western Front and a terrible journey undertaken by two boys like a ghost train ride into a day-lit house of horror, periodically descending into night and then resurfacing into an alien world, bright with menace.And it’s filmed in one extraordinary single take by cinematographer Roger Deakins, a continuous fluid travelling shot (with digital edits sneaked in, evidently at those moments where we lose sight of them, or in moments of darkness or explosion – but where exactly, I mostly couldn’t tell) .Mendes shows us what these soldiers see and sometimes wheels the camera around so we can see them seeing it: a gruelling odyssey whose trench scenes are perhaps intended to recall Kubrick’s Paths of Glory – and later our stricken hero enunciates a panicky line in the midst of his terrified comrades that reminded me of something similar from Apocalypse Now: “Where’s your commanding officer?” (The single-take horror also reminded me of the TV director in that film, frantically telling the numbed grunts not to look at the camera. I wonder if this might have inspired Mendes?)The situation is that Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George MacKay) are lance corporals – and messengers. These men, like the rest of their company, have been lulled into a false sense of security by what appears to have been a German retreat, and an imminent “big push” from the Allied forces to clinch victory.But the gruff General (Colin Firth) tells them that aerial photo reconnaissance has disclosed that so far from having retreated, the Germans have simply withdrawn to a position where they are better defended, luring their enemy onward into a trap. Now another British division is about to advance into certain slaughter. Field telephone communication having been cut off, the only way to tell them to call off their attack is via messenger. And so these two shivering soldiers have to make their way across no man’s land, across the abandoned German lines, through (supposedly) vacated German territory and as far as the advancing Allied troops.Blake and Schofield travel through a postapocalyptic landscape, a bad dream of broken tree stumps, mud lakes left by shell craters, dead bodies, rats. And then when they stumble into the German trenches, they discover how much better built they are, and how much better quipped, trained and led the Germans are – and how much they are more likely to win.But they must carry on, and Mendes and Deakins convey, along with these men’s sense of futility and fear, the strange nausea and exhilaration that Blake and Schofield feel, the nihilist elation that comes with the moment-by-moment experience of survival, fiercely holding on to life with every eardrum-splitting sniper shot. But ahead of them lies chaos and loss.The most extraordinary sequence comes when a German airman crash lands almost on top of Blake and Schofield and there is a moment of simple human compassion when the German staggers out of his blazing craft, dying and begging for water. Schofield runs to get him some from a rusty pump and behind his back – behind the audience’s backs – the story’s most fateful event occurs, off camera. It’s a staggeringly bold bit of storytelling, and it comes off.The single-take technique fascinatingly creates a kind of theatrical effect: the spectacle of two people moving through an unbroken space. It is immersive, yes, but that overused word does not quite convey the paradoxical alienation that is being created: the distance, the pure strangeness. The two men’s experiences are bizarre and shocking, but a poignant and then tragic sympathy is finally dredged up from the mud of their ordeal.1917 is Mendes’s most purely ambitious and passionate picture since his misunderstood and underappreciated Jarhead of 2005. It’s bold, thrilling film-making. 1917 is released in the US on 25 December, in Australia on 7 January 2020 and in the UK on 10 January 2020."
Little Women review – sisters are writin' it for themselves in Greta Gerwig's festive treat,"Saoirse Ronan and Emma Watson head a terrific all-star cast in a wonderfully warm, funny and heartfelt version of Louisa May Alcott’s coming-of-age classic",5,"There’s nothing little about Greta Gerwig’s rich, warm, bustlingly populated and passionately devoted new tribute to Louisa May Alcott’s classic novel of sisterhood. She revives Little Women as a coming-of-age movie, a marriage comedy, a sibling-rivalry drama – and perhaps most interestingly of all, an autofictional manifesto for writing your own life. This is where fledgling author Jo March must negotiate her terms directly with her mutton-chop whiskered publisher (no agent!). She must enforce her own copyright prerogative. She must decide, having created a heroine so clearly based on herself, if a wedding is the only plausible ending to her story, which gives her a commercial bestseller and a materially comfortable life.Saoirse Ronan plays the fiercely opinionated and boundlessly energetic Jo, one of four teenage sisters increasingly faced with genteel poverty in 19th-century Massachusetts, their father (Bob Odenkirk) away serving the north’s cause in the civil war. Thoughtful Meg is played by Emma Watson, Florence Pugh is pugnacious, hot-headed Amy, and Eliza Scanlen the delicate, gentle Beth. Their mother, Marmie, is played with style and easy authority by Laura Dern, and the casting brings into view a slight facial resemblance between Dern and Ronan. James Norton plays John Brooke, the diffident, penniless tutor who is to capture Meg’s heart; and Professor Friedrich Bhaer, the middle-aged German academic who is to be Jo’s fatherly suitor-slash-mentor in New York, is reinvented as a considerably younger and dishier Frenchman played by Louis Garrel.As for the two most legendary characters: cantankerous and wealthy Aunt March (this story’s equivalent of Betsey Trotwood) is played by Meryl Streep. The handsome boy next door Laurie is probably in love with all four of the March girls, and this film shows how they collectively have feelings for him, combining sisterly protectiveness, intense crush, exasperated disdain and One-Directional fan worship. Laurie is played by Timothée Chalamet. Surely, no other casting was possible. It is great to see Chris Cooper playing Laurie’s kindly grandfather.Gerwig’s treatment of the story has the March girls being played by the same four actors (not splitting them into younger and older versions as is sometimes the case) and structures the story into a mesh of flashbacks, intercutting their girlish episodes at home with their later lives as young women: Jo as the writer in New York, Meg married to John, Amy on a European tour with the formidable aunt who hopes thereby to school her in the reality of the marriage market, and Beth at home where she will meet her own awful fate.Gerwig’s Little Women have a great collective vitality, always puppyishly hugging and crowding around, while getting into scrapes and putting on theatre shows. They have something of the Brontë sisters or even the Dashwood sisters but with a much more rough-and-ready Americanness. The movie devises a heartbreaking wish-fulfilment-versus-reality double sequence about Beth’s final illness that for a second will have you doubting what you remember.But the sharpest, fiercest thing about this story is the unspoken, unacknowledged face-off between Jo and Amy, romantically triangulated with Laurie, who is a physically slight figure (slighter than Christian Bale in the 1994 version) impish, puckish, littler than the women who surround him. Jo and Amy aspire to be artists, and interestingly an artistic career is the only professional alternative they can imagine to being a wife and mother. But only Jo will find success creatively. Amy is furthermore guilty of the unpardonable sin of burning Jo’s manuscript in a fit of pique, and being saved from falling into the ice – she is the one who has to get saved, not the saviour – is a redemptive moment that only redoubles Jo’s superiority.And Laurie is to play a vital part in their drama. Amy (a character that Pugh makes much more tough and grownup than usual) is embittered by Laurie’s proposal of marriage, which comes after he has been rejected by Jo: “I’ve been second to Jo my whole life.” And Chalamet interestingly conveys the temporarily jaded and (we assume) dissolute life that Laurie is pursuing in Paris after the rejection.Yet, despite a vivid pairing of Jo and Laurie and some great romantic chemistry between Ronan and Chalamet, and, despite it being perfectly obvious that Laurie is a more compellingly romantic catch than Bhaer (however dreamy Garrel may be), we know how things don’t turn out the way we might expect, or want. We might assume that Jo and Laurie should be together, but the movie insists on marriage being not quite the same as a romcom happy ending. Perhaps it is really Meg and John who have this.This is such a beguiling, generous film from Gerwig. There is a lot of love in it. Little Women is released in the US on Christmas Day, in the UK on Boxing Day and in Australia on New Year’s Day."
Cattle Hill review – udderly bewildering rock'n'roll cows,"A heifer with dreams of stardom turns to her retired rock star dad for advice in this strange, candy-coloured family animation",2,"If you see just one Norwegian animated film featuring a bull being treated for BSE with electroshock therapy, make sure it’s Cattle Hill. Offering a possibly troubling glimpse into the national psyche, director Lise I Osvoll and screenwriter Anne Elvedal’s deceptively candy-coloured film aimed at the family audience revolves around a teenage cow called Klara, living in the city with her divorced mother. Klara dreams of winning a talent competition, or even just having a talent, and decides to visit her retired rock star dad at his bucolic farm in search of tuition and bonding.But the poor bull seems to have lost his mind, and is convinced some nefarious rascal, invisible to everyone else, is stealing from him and ruining his life. Meanwhile, an evil porcine landlady on one of those gyroscopic hoverboard things comes round to demand he make a hundred apple pies by next week or he will lose the farm. Like any good bovine daughter, Klara decides to help and soon discovers the antagonist is a mischievous and insatiably greedy scarecrow with a carved pumpkin head, whom she and her new friend – a shy goat with vertigo issues – can only thwart by baking a pie made out of poo.The goofy-looking figures have been animated on the cheap, which means the fur textures look like plastic microfibre cloth and the faces barely move. That they’re voiced by an unknown American-accented cast, dubbed over the original Norwegian, just makes this feel even more displaced and bizarre – but the songs are surprisingly catchy. If this doesn’t give your kids nightmares, they might love it. Cattle Hill is released in the UK on 22 November."
"Greener Grass review – weird, deadpan satire of sunny suburbia",A soccer mom casually gives away her baby to an admiring neighbour in a comedy with echoes of The Stepford Wives,3,"Jocelyn DeBoer and Dawn Luebbe are LA comedy actors and veterans of the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre improv group who are now jointly making their feature debut as writer-director-stars of this elaborately deadpan suburbia satire inhabited by squeaky-clean people with hints of Stepford and Todd Solondz. The title might lead you to think that it is all about envy – the gnawing torment that your neighbours’ lawn is lusher, their SUV bigger etc – but it’s not, or not exactly.DeBoer and Luebbe play Jill and Lisa, two best frenemies and competitive stay-at-home soccer moms whose husbands do the breadwinning; they live in a manicured little community where people drive around in golf carts. Jill has a strange need to please people, so when Lisa says that Jill’s new baby is adorable, Jill impulsively offers it to her and Lisa accepts.This weird glassy-eyed trade, accepted as perfectly normal by everyone involved but gradually regretted by Jill like a sleepwalker beginning to wake up, colours the rest of the movie with an air of surreal ghastliness. Strange hallucinatory things happen, semi-symbolic metamorphoses occur, and Jill begins to lose her sheen of perfectness.Of course, there’s a fish-in-a-barrel quality to this movie’s targets and, as with so much satire, I suspected that “weird” is easier than “funny”. But this grew on me. There is something startling about the TV shows that the children are watching, including a daytime adventure called Kids With Knives, and I liked Jill’s horrified reaction to her stroppy and incontinent child Julian (Julian Hillard) who bizarrely shrieks: “Mom’s a school! ‘I’m mom, full of rooms and clocks!’”It creates its own unwholesome self-enclosed Percocet aesthetic, and perhaps this is a film for America’s contemporary opioid culture. Greener Grass is released in the UK on 22 November."
Here for Life review – Artangel's odd odyssey through the city streets,"Part documentary, part drama, this uncompromising film blurs the boundaries between fake and real, truth and fiction",2,"Produced by Artangel, the arts-patronage outfit that has backed a wide range of visual artists and avant-garde filmmakers including Clio Barnard, Matthew Barney and Richard Billingham, this debut feature for directors Andrea Luka Zimmerman and Adrian Jackson is almost impossible to categorise. It opens cold without explanation as it introduces various non-professional participants either interacting with each other or directly addressing the camera in assorted spots around east and south London, including Brixton market and Billingsgate fish market. It is part documentary, part collectively created drama that keeps all its boundaries – between the fake and the real, biography/confession and fiction, and so on – porous and smudgy.In the early stages, even an open-minded viewer might struggle to see where this is all going and what holds these fragmentary shards of performance and conversation together. It’s all a bit of a jumble: stories about troubled childhoods, fractured or even abusive relationships, and sudden beautiful bursts of song and rapped poetry. Without any captions to explain who’s who, you can’t identify the performers who make some bits immensely entertaining, such as the elderly man with waist-long dreadlocks who sings spirituals in tectonic baritone, or the lithe woman with a buzz cut whose vocal performance at an open-mic session is mesmerising.The more naturalistic moments where the performers are just gassing with one another, about menopause or how to steal a bicycle, can be just as engaging but only if you absorb the material with the same amused, semi-attentive gaze you use on video art in a gallery playing on a loop. Watched in one go in a cinema won’t do the material any favours. Here for Life is released in the UK on 22 November."
Dark Waters review – Mark Ruffalo v big business in enraging drama,The shocking true story of how corporate corruption infected the water of a small town is brought to the screen in mostly effective form by Todd Haynes,3,"At the end of Dark Waters, a dense, angry drama about the horrifying health effects of corporate negligence, it’s possible, and perhaps quite likely, to leave the cinema with complaints about the specifics of the film-making. Sometimes it pushes too much, sometimes not enough, a conventional procedural with undeniable flaws. But what’s entirely impossible as the credits roll, is to leave without a palpable sense of fury, a real world, off-screen outrage directed not just at a particular issue but at a particular company. It’s a film that works best as a two-hour assault on DuPont, a chemical company with toxic blood all over its hands.It shouldn’t be this rare to see a film in 2019 imploring us to bear witness to crimes committed by a hugely powerful, and profitable, corporation, one that’s named and shamed repeatedly throughout, but it still feels like an outlier, belonging more in the 70s than it does now. It’s this focused rage that propels it forward, giving it a vitality that’s often missing from the direction, a strange choice for director Todd Haynes whose films are typically known for their queerness and vibrancy.Here he’s a steady, if anonymous, pair of hands, telling a story based on a shocking New York Times long read about dogged, modest corporate lawyer Rob Bilott (Mark Ruffalo) who’s confronted with a game-changing case. Working for a high-profile law firm, acting on behalf of major chemical clients, he finds himself reminded of his humble beginnings when a farmer from his home town of Parkersburg enters his slick office. His farm is dying, or more specifically his cows are, 190 of them to date, and he’s convinced that it’s a result of drinking water infected by a neighbouring factory owned by DuPont, one of the world’s largest chemical companies. Bilott is initially reluctant to take on a personal case, given his firm’s focus on corporate clients, but he finds the evidence undeniable and the further he digs, the bigger the case becomes.It’s been quite the year for big-screen whistleblowers, kicked off in Sundance with Amazon’s tight, tense CIA thriller The Report and the far more plodding Katharine Gun drama Official Secrets. Dark Waters falls somewhere between the two, solidly effective and mostly involving yet relying a little too much on the dusty conventions of the subgenre to make a major mark. Arriving in the thick of awards season, it’s likely to get buried, or drowned, by the competition although its damning snapshot of corporate corruption and one man’s tireless, heroic effort to expose it should be seen and remembered. It probably would have been a surer fit for Netflix and Haynes’s muted work behind the camera gives it the feel of a film intended for the small screen.It’s his most straightforward project to date and his serviceable work is matched with an equally sturdy script from Mario Correa and Matthew Michael Carnahan, the latter having ample experience in taking Goliath to task having co-written 2016’s criminally underrated, BP-baiting Deepwater Horizon. There’s a simple pleasure in watching Bilott do his job and do it well, despite the odds that were stacked against him and Ruffalo avoids turning him into a showman, quietly and diligently finding a way to bring DuPont to task within the framework of the legal system. The focus on the minutiae of the case makes the film’s silly, incongruous scene of Bilott worrying his car might be rigged to explode feel all the more unnecessary (it was predictably used in the trailer, hoping to fool viewers into thinking of this as a thriller). Instead, it’s the insidious confidence of a company of this scale that has a far more chilling effect, the accepted knowledge that wealth will win no matter what.Ruffalo is reliably solid in the lead, keeping his performance believably dialled down but those around him are less well-modulated. There are oversized turns, or at least scenes, from Tim Robbins, Bill Pullman and especially Bill Camp as the farmer in need while, as Bilott’s wife, Anne Hathaway is both miscast and misused. The thankless wife role is a given in this territory and what’s frustrating here is how the film gives us an interesting thread (Bilott’s wife was also a lawyer who gave up her career to have children) and then abandons it completely. Attaching an actor of Hathaway’s status leads us to expect more than what she’s given and when her big scenes do come, they don’t land. We can see her acting too hard which automatically removes us from the naturalistic setting.Misgivings aside, Dark Waters deserves to make an impact and early speculation suggests that it will. This week a Wall Street analyst, after watching the film, claimed that it could be “very damaging” for DuPont and perhaps that’s its biggest ace. As a drama, it’s patchy but as a document, it’s undeniable.Dark Waters is released in the US on 22 November and in the UK on 28 February"
"Red Devil review – sex, drugs and far from droll",A lamentable dearth of laughs infects this comedy-fantasy set in a nightmarish dystopia where everyone is high on something,1,"A decidedly tedious, profoundly unfunny comedy-crime-fantasy set in some nightmarish version of a British metropolis (essentially a sound stage with murky lighting) where nearly everyone is high on something, be it super-skunk or a highly addictive, crack-like substance called Red Devil.Writer-director Savvas D Michael (Smoking Guns) prods the plot forward at gunpoint as we follow three converging storylines. In one, Hugo (Ian Reddington), an ageing cannabis farmer-dealer in a flappy-eared hat, entertains an assortment of customers, none of whom seem especially interested in hanging out with him and listening to his appalling taste in music and sharing the obligatory spliff after purchase. His only hanger-on is Gabriel (Matt Lapinskas), a sneering millennial who, judging by the black-feathered bolero he wears, apparently raided the costume box of a low-rent production of Swan Lake before he bought a handgun.Meanwhile, married couple Oscar (Jack Turner) and Ella (Fernanda Diniz) are on a murderous rampage through the city, killing Red Devil dealers. They are so turned on by their vigilante antics they sometimes have sex in the middle of an assassination. Finally, Red addict Riley (Jamie Crew) snivels a lot while desperately searching for a fix, the shortage created by Oscar and Ella’s antics.The banal and ludicrous, sub-early-Tarantino dialogue at least sounds vaguely like the kind of stoned nonsense people drone at each other when they are high, but that doesn’t make this any more entertaining to watch. The sprinkling of casually amoral violence and mild misogyny are just the CBD gummies on the rancid cake of stupid that is this waste of hard-drive memory. Red Devil is released in the UK on 15 November."
The Mandalorian review – splashy Star Wars show is a dusty disappointment,Jon Favreau’s foray into the Star Wars universe for Disney+ fails to impress in a first episode that aims to be a ‘spaghetti western in space’,2,"The recent efforts of the Disney/Lucasfilm behemoth to free the Star Wars universe from the shackles of its own story have met with mixed results, to put it mildly. Standalone films Rogue One and Solo billed themselves as “A Star Wars Story” in an effort to break out of the trilogy-of-trilogies while retaining the essence of the franchise, whatever that much might mean. (That definition being either the thrill of intergalactic derring-do or the built-in brand-name familiarity, adjusting for cynicism.) Both features, however, failed to conjure an ineffable something that’s always made the numbered installments pop. The spinoffs’ preoccupation with proximity to the earlier films’ context – trumpeting all the ways in which these expansions connect to or, even worse, explain the magic of George Lucas’s far-far-away – weighed them down and held them back from full independence.The Mandalorian, Jon Favreau’s small-screen addition to the canon and the marquee release for the nascent and bug-riddled Disney+ streaming platform, largely evades this pitfall. Excepting the more detour-heavy episodes of the assorted animated series, this represents the first successful attempt to reconcile the distance between being an appendage of a popular intellectual property and being its own work. Favreau sets his latest effort apart by assuming the cinematic language of the spaghetti western, a genre that looks and feels sufficiently different from what’s come before. But while the series’ pilot episode achieves a certain distinctness, it lacks in distinction; it is its own thing, and yet not much of anything.Pedro Pascal portrays the title bounty hunter, though we have to take the production’s word for it. For the entirety of the first episode’s 40 minutes, Pascal’s face remains concealed beneath a mask of the sort previously worn by Fetts Jango and Boba. The character’s identity remains concealed and any link to the Fett lineage blessedly unremarked upon, but it does contribute to his overall impression as a nonentity. Even Casey Affleck’s performance from behind a linen sheet in A Ghost Story had more nuance and emotional conveyance than the blank non-stare of the Mandalorian’s mask.Favreau’s only slightly missing the mark of “enigma” he’s going for, in accordance with the already espoused reference point of Clint Eastwood’s Man With No Name from the films of Sergio Leone. (We even get faux-Ennio Morricone riffs on synthesizer in the background.) It’s a sturdy model from which to build this figure of otherwise little palpable substance. Aside from his clumsily written quips, he prefers to operate as the strong silent type, traversing the cosmos and hauling in law-breakers in exchange for a quick payday. Favreau sets the majority of this episode’s scenes in genre-appropriate desert climates, with a noteworthy departure on an ice-planet concealing a less-than-impactful CGI monstrosity. The long-form homage works, on the whole, until the time comes to lay the cards on the table and Favreau has to re-stage a classic sequence from The Wild Bunch just to muster a grand finale.“Spaghetti western but in space” is so much better in theory than in practice, a recurring theme in the pilot episode. Other concepts more entertaining as written sentences to be mentally gnawed on than realized images: “Nick Nolte in prosthetic makeup as an alien blerg-rancher”; “Carl Weathers exchanging laments about the travails of freelancing”; and “Werner Herzog delicately enunciating the word ‘parsec’”. However outré the building blocks of this first episode may be on paper, they lose their sense of wonder in translation to the screen. Maybe it’s just the absence of John Williams’ theme music that triggers childlike awe as if from Pavlovian conditioning.The pilot’s final moments, in which – and stop reading here if you’re wary of spoilers, though to what extent can one spoil the first episode of a serial television show, really? – Pascal’s gunslinger discovers what sure looks like baby Yoda, foretell future episodes embedding themselves in the narrative tapestry of the main films. The revelations of what role this shriveled-up 50-year-old infant will play, as well as the reason Herzog’s antagonist wants it dead, will undoubtedly drag this series closer to the superficial resemblance of a Star War. Though that feels immaterial to the question of whether the show will improve over time. Its issues hew toward the fundamentals of direction, performance, and dialogue, more problems of basic filmmaking skill than miscalculated vision. Favreau started from a more specific, vivid place than in his jobs for Marvel or on Disney’s wretched Lion King remake. Unlike his nomadic antihero, however, he doesn’t take it much of anywhere.The Mandalorian is streaming weekly on Disney+ in the US now and in the UK from 31 March"
Charlie's Angels review – ramshackle action reboot goes at half throttle,There’s intermittent fun to be had in this throwaway relaunch of the female secret agent franchise but the party is cut short by incoherent action and a clunky script ,3,"Back in 2000, the glossy relaunch of Charlie’s Angels felt like a genuine pop culture event. The central casting of Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu, all at the height of their fame, was an impressively inspired get. The accompanying lead single from Destiny’s Child was not only a smash hit but a deserved one. The gaudy aesthetic and post-Matrix bullet time action were laughable but also undeniably of the moment. It was the most 2000 film released in 2000, and at the time it was impossible to avoid – a slick, pre-packaged blockbuster received with as much enthusiasm as it was made. Almost 20 years, one sequel and one failed TV series later, the franchise is back, but all that buzz has been replaced with something else: deafening silence.The sub-par marketing campaign and sub-sub-par lead track from Miley Cyrus, Ariana Grande and Lana Del Rey haven’t landed with much of an impact, while the new trio (one recognisable star and two question marks) don’t bring with them the same curiosity factor as their noughties foremothers. Tracking for an opening of less than $15m, compared with the 2000 iteration’s $40m without inflation, there seems to be a sense of apathy, or even worse, unawareness from audiences for the latest refresh, easily dismissed as an inevitable rather than necessary product. It might sound like faint praise to say Charlie’s Angels 2019 is slightly better than expected, but in another year of ill-conceived reboots, it’s a depressingly low bar.What’s striking, and refreshing, about the latest version is that it’s written and directed by a woman, an attempted course correct for a franchise that’s typically been associated with a rather leery male gaze. It’s the first screenplay and second film as director for Elizabeth Banks, a predominantly comic actor who’s edged her way deeper into Hollywood by moving further behind the scenes. It also boasts a story credit from the Pulitzer prize-winning playwright David Auburn, proof of which I would dare anyone to recognise, given how scrappy the narrative feels, thrashing around carelessly from country to country, set piece to set piece.The plot brings together three new angels, two of whom are already embedded within the Townsend agency and one of whom is an unlikely recruit. There’s Sabina (Kristen Stewart), whose quippy nature irks the more serious-minded Jane (British newcomer Ella Balinska), and both are protecting whistleblower Elena (Aladdin’s Naomi Scott), who fears for the dangers attached to a new power source her company is developing. After a meeting goes sour, the three are on the run along with their Bosley (Banks), or in this universe one of many Bosleys (who also include Patrick Stewart, Djimon Hounsou and, er, Michael Strahan, because … sure) and they must work together to find a way to save the world … in style.It’s an initial relief to find that Banks hasn’t decided to go the way of so many reboots and bring us a grounded, gritty take on featherlight material, and it’s her awareness of the inherent silliness of the franchise that proves to be one of the film’s saving graces. It’s never taken too seriously, and thus is hard to dislike, a disposable film aware of its own disposability. But there’s enough that proves to be entertaining to make one wish it was just that bit better. Key to the film’s formula is a balancing act between action and comedy, as in previous incarnations, and somehow Banks manages to fall short on both. The script is a polish or two away from really flying, with so many one-liners tanking, and the dynamic between the three women never truly sparks in the way one would hope. The action is similarly underwhelming and often incoherently edited, whether it’s a fight scene or a car chase, and when the laughs and stunts are paired, there’s a shortage of fizz, like a glass of champagne that’s been left out too long.The actors are game, though, and while post-Twilight Stewart has often struggled to juggle bigger roles with her mostly exceptional work on the indie outskirts (she made for a dry, disengaged Snow White), she’s more comfortable here, having fun as the comedy support, trying her darnedest to add humour to a script that’s sorely lacking. Her character is allegedly queer, although all we get is a brief look to confirm it, another much-hyped yet rather damp attempt to provide multiplex visibility for the LGBT community. Newcomer Balinska and Scott are solid enough, bringing energy to less fleshed-out characters, while Stewart has some fun chewing scenery around them.There are mixed attempts from Banks to try to modernise the gender politics. While a sharper awareness of how men underestimate the skills and physical competency of women is nicely heightened and the trio are made to be sexy without being turned into sex objects, there are other flourishes that don’t work as well. After the cold open, Banks inserts a clumsy, cheap-looking montage of random girls and young women before the film’s title, which feels more like a deodorant ad than the start of a mainstream movie, while the sisterhood and intense bond between the three angels feels baseless and lacking in texture. It makes the decision to almost entirely eradicate love interests in place of female friendship better conceptually than on screen.It’s forgettable on reflection, but pacey in the moment, proving to be far less wretched a watch than so many other creatively bankrupt IP resurrections of late. It’s better than it could have been while also not being quite good enough to warrant any further instalments.Charlie’s Angels is released in the US on 15 November and in the UK on 29 November"
Lady and the Tramp review – Disney's lovestruck dogs come to half-life,"A slick, serviceable, streaming-only remake updates the technology but can’t quite recreate the magic of the 1955 original",3,"Disney’s glossy live-action update of Lady and the Tramp, like the majority of the studio’s other IRL remakes, exists purely because it has to rather than because it should do, a product born not from a creative brainwave but from a commercial inevitability. The hugely profitable, and mostly tiresome, trend of dusting off handcrafted classics and rehauling them for a new audience has sped up this year with Aladdin, The Lion King, Dumbo and a Maleficent sequel all released theatrically, the underwhelming box office of the latter two hinting at growing audience fatigue. The decision to premiere Lady and the Tramp digitally, morphing it into a TV movie, launching Disney’s splashy new content platform Disney+, is therefore a wise one and taken as such, it’s adequate if wholly unnecessary entertainment, ending up somewhere between a lady and a tramp.The story, still simple and still effective, tells of romance across class borders between two dogs: Lady (voiced by Tessa Thompson), who lives a comfortable life as the surrogate child of a human couple (Kiersey Clemons and Thomas Mann), and Tramp (voiced by Justin Theroux), a street-dwelling loner whose day-to-day depends on whatever scraps of food he can find. Lady’s domestic bliss is sent into a tailspin when an actual human baby arrives and through a frantic set of circumstances, she finds herself on the street, roughing it with her unlikely new friend.There’s some low-stakes enjoyment to be had here, benefited largely from the film’s Disney+ drop. It’s certainly slick and boasts higher production values than the average streaming premiere but it’s a comparatively modest Disney remake that would have felt dwarfed, in a number of ways, on the big screen. The 1955 original was a breezy 76 minutes and in updating, The Lego Ninjago Movie director Charlie Bean has added almost half an hour, a considerable amount of padding and one that didn’t do Kenneth Branagh’s 38-minute-longer take on Cinderella any favours. It’s a smoother expansion here, the film’s laid-back pace pairing nicely with the Savannah setting and a jazzy soundtrack, even if the extended plot doesn’t add a whole lot more of notable worth (although thankfully the uneasy orientalism of the Siamese Cat Song has been replaced with something far less problematic).The central dogs are impressively trained and cute to watch but there’s a lingering problem that also affected this summer’s big-budget remake of The Lion King. In trying to make talking animals look as real as they can, there’s an emotional depth missing from their expressions when they’re speaking. Thompson and Theroux, along with fellow voice actors Janelle Monáe, Sam Elliott and Ashley Jensen try hard, but there’s something not quite, ahem, animated enough about their on-screen incarnations. It removes us from the more emotional moments and it’s an issue the studio will need to figure out before The Little Mermaid, given that a crab has at least two musical numbers. The horror.There’s also a frustrating waste of Clemons, who was so incredibly charming in last year’s little-seen music indie Hearts Beat Loud, stuck here with little to do, or sing, as the human lady of the house. But perhaps the strangest thing about the film is that it was co-written by the “godfather of mumblecore”, Andrew Bujalski, an indie auteur whose acclaimed lo-fi films often feel improvised in nature, given his rejection of so many traditional scripting standards. His influence is sadly invisible here and any hope that the film might have followed in the footsteps of 2016’s exceptional Pete’s Dragon, a remake from similarly mismatched arthouse staple David Lowery, is left out on the street. The script, like so much of the film, is serviceable at best, never once explaining to us why Bujalski would want to get involved other than for financial reasons, which one wouldn’t begrudge him given the scale of his output to date.Lady and the Tramp works well enough on its own simple terms as watchable, competently made home viewing.

"Midway review – a long, loud and tedious history lesson",Roland Emmerich’s version of the second world war Pacific battle is a drearily earnest monument to CGI mayhem,2,"Never in the history of war movies have so few thrills been delivered by so much mayhem and destruction. The attack on the US naval base at Pearl Harbor in 1941 and the battle of Midway six months later have been brought to the screen with boredom-inspiring spectacle by Roland Emmerich. The film is a passion project and comes with a guarantee that its events are historically accurate.This is the director who sent aliens to invade Earth in Independence Day and armed the president with a rocket launcher in White House Down. But now Emmerich is getting serious, carving a great monument of a movie, a cinematic statue to the bravery of the young men who sacrificed their lives in the Pacific. And like watching a statue for two and a half hours, there’s nothing to do but sit back and yawn.The film begins with Pearl Harbor, a battle scene that, like the set pieces that follow, hurls a barrage of CGI with some mild 12A-rated carnage that never offers a real sense of jeopardy. Ed Skrein, the British actor from Deadpool, is Lieutenant Dick Best, a showoff pilot whose “cowboy bullshit” in the cockpit is thwarting his promotion chances to squadron commander. Skrein does his best, but a couple of tics – gum chewing and a thick New Jersey accent – do not a character make.The most interesting strand of the movie involves Patrick Wilson as intelligence officer Edwin Layton, whose warnings about a Japanese attack were repeatedly ignored by top brass. Woody Harrelson (looking distractingly like Ted Danson with bleached white hair) is the newly appointed commander of the Pacific fleet, Admiral Nimitz, a man who overcomes his instinctive mistrust of the geeks in the codebreaking unit to take heed of their intelligence about a new Japanese assault.The Americans go into the battle of Midway as underdogs, outmanned and outgunned, but with the element of surprise on their side this time: the Japanese are unaware that their naval messages are being intercepted. The clash of firepower when it comes is a colossal thundering snore of a battle. But the heroism of dive bombers like Dick is something to behold as they fly their planes nose down to get as close as possible to the enemy target. Today, the whole thing would be executed by unmanned drones operated thousands of miles from the war zone.Emmerich goes mercifully easy on the flag-waving patriotism, and he’s pretty even-handed, too, in his portrayal of the Japanese enemy. But his film never really grapples with the human cost of war, and the death of so many young men. A big, long, loud, boring history lesson, it’s a movie that opens a distance between yesterday’s fights and today’s. Emmerich and his scriptwriter Wes Tooke seem to be saying: “Look at these feisty brave boys, who strapped into planes on doomed missions – they did it for our freedom.” The best thing to do with this movie would be to take cover and wait for it to pass. Midway is released in the UK and the US on 8 November and in Australia on 28 November."
Luce review – hard lessons for a high-school star,"In this strange and muddled drama, Octavia Spencer plays a teacher who makes an unsettling discovery about one of her pupils",2,"Here is a contemporary ensemble drama that sets out to stress test fault lines in US society – racial, sexual, generational. It is adapted by JC Lee from his off-Broadway play and the director is Julius Onah.Kelvin Harrison Jr plays Luce, a brilliant African-American high-school student heading for future greatness. His career is all the more remarkable considering that at seven years old, he had been an Eritrean child soldier, adopted by a white liberal couple, Amy (Naomi Watts) and Peter (Tim Roth). But Luce has this too-good-to-be-true broad smile and borderline insufferable attitude of praise for his school.His history teacher Harriet Wilson (Octavia Spencer) doesn’t appear to like this overachiever much and then calls in his mom to discuss a certain unsettling paper Luce has written about the radical revolutionary Frantz Fanon – and the fact that Luce has stashed illegal fireworks in his locker. Her suspicious attitude triggers a disastrous series of events.Luce is a strange film. It’s certainly about secrets and lies and stereotypical assumptions, and its ambiguities and unresolved mysteries are intentionally created. The pairing of Roth and Watts reminded me of the married couple they played in Michael Haneke’s horror remake Funny Games – an echo that had me wondering if this was inspired by the high-school mystery in Haneke’s film Hidden. But each constituent part of the drama, each narrative twist, each enigmatic gesture, is weirdly forced, overacted and under-explained.It is strange how Harriet overreacts to the surely reasonably well-known figure of Frantz Fanon (Zadie Smith has a recent essay relating Fanon to Jordan Peele’s movie Get Out) and even if we assume that her attitude concerns her other suspicions and is in any case a symptom of her fraught family situation – well, these plot lines themselves appear to lead nowhere, despite an almost bizarrely melodramatic and questionably judged “meltdown” scene for Harriet’s troubled sister Rosemary (Marsha Stephanie Blake).On top of all this, there is a consent issue involving Luce’s ex-girlfriend Stephanie (Andrea Bang) whose own apparent changes of mind and heart are opaque in ways that are dramatically unconvincing. Luce feels theatrical in the wrong way: muddled and contrived. Luce is released in the UK on 8 November."
Last Christmas review – Emma Thompson's romcom is an overstuffed turkey,An attempt to pay tribute to the music of George Michael and the fandom of Love Actually fails on both counts and at many more things along the way,2,"Somewhere in the last decade, audiences, and in turn financiers, fell out of love with the London-set romantic comedy, a subgenre that had almost single-handedly been keeping the British film industry alive, or at least somewhat in profit. They were repetitive, predictable and filled with characters who were exclusively, uncomfortably, posh and white yet they were also undeniably effective crowd-pleasers and like many, I’ve missed them, as parodical as they can often be. So has Emma Thompson, it seems. Because with all the confidence of a well-spoken Oxbridge alumnus delivering a climactic declaration of love in a public place, she’s chucked together Last Christmas, a thirsty little festive film eager to remind us all why we actually loved Love Actually in the first place.Based on the song by Wham! because sure, Last Christmas tells the story of George Michael-obsessed, former Yugoslavian 26-year-old Kate (33-year-old Emilia Clarke, with a regular posh accent), a Disneyfied Fleabag whose foibles are cutesy rather than catastrophic. She spouts lines like “Why is my life so shit?” and “A shitting bird just shit in my eye!” while working in an an all-year-round Christmas store in Covent Garden (!!!) dressed as an elf (an outfit she keeps on even when she’s off the clock for some bizarre, unexplained reason). But Kate really wants to be a professional singer although she’s technically sort of homeless and lives on whatever couch she can find. She avoids her concerned mother (Thompson, thick comedy accent), exhausts her beleaguered boss (Michelle Yeoh, trying her darndest), frustrates her ever-decreasing circle of friends and drifts from shag to shag while struggling to make anything substantial last.But then, in one of the clumsiest meet-cutes in recent memory, while dusting Christmas decorations, she spots a handsome stranger (Henry Golding) staring at a bird. After a shit on her face (from the bird, not Golding), the pair start to fall for each other and go on a number of geographically questionable saunters around the city. But why does he keep disappearing on her? Can she sort out her life? And would Richard Curtis approve of this?The spoiler-free answer to all three questions would be that you can probably figure it out from the first 20 minutes. It’s all-too-easy to ridicule the work of Curtis but there was a deceptive precision to his scripts, seamlessly balancing the rom with the com, and an awareness of the films that have inspired Last Christmas only serves to highlight its utter incompetence in comparison. It might look the part, with the director Paul Feig successfully capturing the glossy, tourist-friendly London one would crave from such a film, but the script feels like a rejected first draft with unfunny filler one-liners and a scrappy, ill-thought through narrative. It’s a beautifully wrapped Christmas gift that’s filled with rotten turkey leftovers.Kate is the sort of falling-into-a-heap-of-rubbish-without-messing-up-her-artfully-dishevelled-outfit archetype that Feig so carefully managed to avoid in his comic magnum opus Bridesmaids. In that film, Kristen Wiig’s life was a genuine, unvarnished mess and she was a sometimes brittle, often selfish character struggling to get her life back together. But here, there’s a defiant avoidance of nuance or depth in Thompson’s script, co-written by performance artist Bryony Kimmings, and Kate is nothing more than a jumble of sub-Bridget Jones quirks whose heavy eye makeup is used to convey that she’s going through a really rough time. Clarke is also miscast, playing Kate with an uncomfortably forced, overly mannered schtick, trying to emulate a Meg Ryan or a Julia Roberts but without any of their inherent charm. Golding has a bit more of that to spare but the couple has no real chemistry and he’s lumbered with a secret that turns his character into a rather tiresome cad.There are a number of need-to-discuss issues attached to a gonzo, if painfully obvious, third act development that would be impossible to explain here without spoiling but there’s an uneasiness over how the film frames the redemption Kate seems to need and the ways in which she needs to receive it. The final 30 minutes also mean that so much of the film can be repositioned as both unintentionally funny and unintentionally creepy in ways that will likely lead to a stocking’s worth of memes over the coming weeks.Thompson reportedly gained the blessing of George Michael before his death in 2016 and sees the film as a tribute to his music. One of the film’s few plus points is the opportunity to listen to so many of his songs up on the big screen but it’s also the fifth film in the last year that’s used the much-loved back catalogue of a singer or band to carry the heavy emotional lifting that a subpar script can’t manage by itself. Yesterday, Rocketman, Blinded by the Light, Bohemian Rhapsody and now Last Christmas have manipulated our attachment to familiar music in order to force us into feeling something that’s ultimately unearned. So while, Praying for Time still has a hair-raising impact, it’s the song rather than the maudlin scenes it’s paired with that leads us to emote. It’s also an astonishingly straight and sanitised film to be paired with the music of Michael, one of the most unabashedly queer and unapologetically hypersexual public figures in entertainment. Wouldn’t a love story between two men have been a more fitting tribute?The combination of Michael’s music, a cosy festive aesthetic, picturesque London scenery and an irresistible fascination over what the plot morphs into does make Last Christmas sort of digestible in a half-watching-while-drunk-on-eggnog kind of way but this really is a clunky, charmless disappointment. Last Christmas is, or at least should be, cancelled.Last Christmas is out in the US on 8 November and in the UK on 15 November."
After the Wedding review – soapy saga of privilege and philanthropy,Michelle Williams’s free-spirited fundraiser runs into trouble as she looks for handouts in New York society,3,"The Sad Rich White People Movie is one of my favourite genres, and indeed the white people in this English-language remake of Danish film-maker’s Susanne Bier’s 2006 tearjerker are very sad and very rich. Its drama takes place between a lavish country mansion in upstate New York and a five-star hotel in Manhattan. Billy Crudup plays a famous sculptor whose wife, Theresa ( Julianne Moore), has an array of shoes that are uncomfortable, impractical and completely fabulous.Michelle Williams’s free-spirited Isabel, on the other hand, will take any opportunity to kick off her sandals. She runs an orphanage in India and has been sent to New York to secure $2m of funding. If all goes to plan, Theresa will give it to her. Except, as is revealed at Theresa’s daughter’s wedding, Isabel has an existing connection to the family.The rest is difficult to explain without spoiling it. What I can say is that this story of motherhood and moral conundrums, of privilege and philanthropy and “worthy causes” is one whose dramatic twists and soapy reveals feel at odds with the cultivated tone of serious, muted elegance. “There are people with money and principles,” insists Moore; Williams wears an expression that suggests she’s about to be sick."
The Beach Bum – Harmony Korine stoner comedy,Matthew McConaughey is watchable in the title role but his lowbrow antics are an acquired taste,3,"Matthew McConaughey is Moondog, a womanising stoner poet and self-proclaimed “bottom feeder” (“I gotta go low to get high,” he slurs). Depending on who you ask, writer-director Harmony Korine is either an irritant or a provocateur; here, his avatar, Moondog, is a genius with no ambition, filthy rich with lowbrow tastes. The film’s vaudevillian misadventures lack jeopardy and are often played for straight comedy, boosted by cameos from Zac Efron, Jonah Hill, Jimmy Buffett and Snoop Dogg. It’s not unfunny watching McConaughey smoke a joint from between Isla Fisher’s toes, but some viewers may find themselves less enamoured of Moondog than the film is."
By the Grace of God review – thoughtful abuse drama,"François Ozon eschews his normal flashy style for a direct, unvarnished account of three men preyed upon by a Catholic priest in Lyon",3," François Ozon’s timely, tasteful drama, based on real events in Lyon, France, wastes no time launching into the painful details of one man’s boyhood memory of sexual abuse at the hands of a priest. Then another’s. And another’s. Father Preynat (played by Bernard Verley with smiling ambivalence) is the perpetrator; survivors include 40-year-old banker and family man Alexandre (Melvil Poupaud), fiery atheist François (Denis Ménochet) and the emotionally unstable Emmanuel (a bravura performance from Swann Arlaud), brought together when Alexandre raises the issue with Cardinal Barbarin (François Marthouret), 30 years after the fact.The film takes the silence and complicity of those who felt it better not to “scratch the wound” to task. On the matter of why (and indeed, when) some people choose to speak out, and others don’t, it is thoughtful. Tonally, it’s a far cry from the paranoid sleaze of Ozon’s usual film-making mode. There’s perhaps an over-reliance on voiceover by way of letters and emails, though the film’s unvarnished formal directness is a good thing, given the sensitive material."
"Terminator: Dark Fate review – Arnie’s back, as backup","With flying debris and strong female leads, the franchise’s opportunistic sixth film gets the job done",2,"The year is 2022 and in Mexico City, a terminator just dropped out of the sky. A sleek Rev-9 model (Gabriel Luna) has been sent from the future to kill factory worker Dani Ramos (Natalia Reyes). Lucky for Dani, she is soon flanked by two avenging angels; Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), still around and hunting terminators, and an augmented human soldier named Grace (Mackenzie Davis, of Black Mirror’s San Junipero episode) who has time-travelled to serve as her protector. Arnie’s T-800 is also back (he said he would be), providing extra muscle and cheap laughs about interior design.Though it’s the sixth film in the Terminator franchise, this instalment follows on directly from 1991’s Terminator 2: Judgement Day, a way of discarding the series’ less celebrated outings. As a genre exercise, it mostly works; set pieces are tense, explosive and pleasingly gory, littered with flying scraps of metal and meat. Davis in particular is an authoritative presence. As a sequel, it’s baldly opportunistic, grab-bagging contemporary political issues (reproductive justice; undocumented migrants) in a transparent attempt to justify its cultural relevance. Though the narrative is led by three formidable female characters, I noted that the film is directed, written and produced by eight men."
Chained for Life review – astute satire on actors and beauty,Under the Skin’s Adam Pearson impresses in a confrontational film industry tale,4,"When Mabel (Jess Weixler) asks her fellow actor Rosenthal (a magnetic, brilliantly self-aware Adam Pearson) if he has representation, she means to find out whether he has an agent. In context, this question also works as a direct inquiry about whether Rosenthal, who has a genetic disorder called neurofibromatosis that manifests as a facial deformity, has representation on screen. Aaron Schimberg’s wonky, charming satire about the filming of a campy B-movie is full of these kind of confrontational moments. In an impromptu acting lesson, Mabel performs various facial expressions for Rosenthal but can’t quite land on “empathy” (“that looks a lot like pity,” he remarks).“It is a supreme asset for actors and actresses to be beautiful; it gives them greater possibilities for expressiveness,” reads the quotation from film critic Pauline Kael that opens the film. Schimberg’s loving closeups of British actor Pearson, who appeared in Jonathan Glazer’s Under the Skin, suggest otherwise."
A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon review – an out-of-this-world delight,Aardman send Shaun and co into orbit in another dizzyingly inventive film for everyone,4,"Dizzyingly inventive and playfully visual, the sequel to the 2015 Shaun the Sheep feature film expands the scope of the original with a new story that extends way beyond the hedges of Mossy Bottom Farm and out of this world. Even if it were not packed with delightful sight gags (like the original film, there is no dialogue here, although it boasts plenty of grunts and one world-shaking burp), the cine-literate mischief seeded throughout Farmageddon would guarantee an appeal way beyond the junior audience.The plot, which centres on a visit from an adorable alien who looks like an excitable blue tentacled puppy, contains obvious nods to ET. The sheep come to the rescue in a story that references, through sight gags and musical motifs, everything from Doctor Who to 2001: A Space Odyssey to The X-Files. It’s an absolute joy."
Official Secrets review – Keira Knightley excels in Iraq war whistleblower drama,Knightley stars as the GCHQ translator who leaked a classified memo to the Observer exposing the US plot to spy on the UN shortly before the 2003 invasion of Iraq,3,"“Just because you’re the prime minister doesn’t mean you get to make up your own facts.” So says Keira Knightley’s whistleblower in Gavin Hood’s “based on true events” drama, an on-the-nose revisiting of the run-up to the Iraq war that draws clear parallels with the “alternative facts” rhetoric of modern politics. While US and UK intelligence agencies conspire to engineer a justification for invasion, GCHQ translator Katharine Gun (whose real-life bravery deserves celebration) follows her conscience and alerts the media to their dirty-tricks campaign, throwing her quiet life into turmoil, putting her work, marriage and freedom at risk.It’s 2003, and Gun (played with no-nonsense conviction by Knightley) receives a US National Security Agency group email effectively asking her to spy on UN security council members to fix a forthcoming resolution vote for war. She’s outraged, both by the proposal per se and because she believes Blair’s claims of Saddam Hussein’s al-Qaeda links and WMDs aren’t backed up by the evidence. Despite ominous warnings about being “in breach of the Official Secrets Act – some might call that treason”, Gun leaks the email, which finds its way to the offices of the Observer. Here, journos and editors have stand-up showdowns about supporting or opposing the war, while a cast of extras add Greek choric background accompaniment. Declarative statements abound (“If you get it wrong, it’ll sink you; it’ll sink the paper!”) but eventually this “fucking good story” hits the front page, and Gun’s life implodes.After the drone strikes and hi-tech bugs of Hood’s previous nail-biter Eye in the Sky, Official Secrets unfolds in an altogether fustier world of floppy drives and photocopiers, all whirring away to the strains of a soundtrack that works hard to accentuate the air of tension and suspense. It’s a gloomy environment: cinematographer Florian Hoffmeister shrouds the action in a cloak of darkness. Whether we’re in the sinister warrens of GCHQ or the supposedly more comfortable confines of a cafe or a bedroom, Hoffmeister and Hood trap their characters in dim pools of light, shadows crowding the edges of the frame.By contrast, there’s a pantomine element to some of the performances, most notably Rhys Ifans’s comically chaotic rendering of investigative journalist Ed Vulliamy, mutteringly referred to as a “nutter”, and played accordingly. As Observer editor (and Blairite flag-waver) Roger Alton, the baldified Conleth Hill comes on like a cross between Ed Asner’s Lou Grant and the Fat Controller from Thomas the Tank Engine, all huff and bluster as he mishears “Sunni and Shia” as “Sonny and Cher”, storming around in a sweary, sweaty stew. Meanwhile Matt Smith is heroically handsome and endearingly deflating as reporter Martin Bright, wryly noting that an underground carpark rendezvous with Yvonne (“Fucking”) Ridley is “a little bit Deep Throat, don’t you think?” – an invocation of All the President’s Men that does this film few favours.Amid the clutter of broad-strokes thumbnails and celebrity cameos (Tamsin Greig as former Foreign Office deputy legal adviser Elizabeth Wilmshurst; Kenneth Cranham as a scowly Judge Hyam), Knightley’s nuanced portrayal of the uncertain, self-doubting Gun comes as something of a relief. She’s particularly good at conveying Gun’s horror when realising that her actions may have endangered her husband Yasar (Adam Bakri), a Kurdish Turk whose legal status proves vulnerable. A distanced close-up on Knightley’s face as Ralph Fiennes’s lawyer Ben Emmerson lays bare the Kafka-esque ramifications of her plight is masterfully understated.Adapted by Hood’s co-writers Gregory and Sara Bernstein from Marcia and Thomas Mitchell’s book The Spy Who Tried to Stop a War, Official Secrets inevitably takes some dramatic liberties with its truths. In a recent Guardian feature, for example, former foreign desk assistant Nicole Mowbray recalled how this paper’s readers’ editor had phoned her to explain politely “with deft understatement and a total lack of drama” that a typing snafu she’d made had caused “something of an international incident”. On screen, Mowbray is bawled out by Alton in front of the whole office; a minor invention, perhaps, but one that reminds us that most dramatised depictions of “true events” can be found guilty of “sexing up” their sources – even those inspired by stories in which the devil really is in the detail.Of course, amid the cacophony of barefaced lying that Trump and Johnson have made the norm in this “post-truth” era, Blair’s bland massaging of facts (smugly reassuring David Frost that “war is not inevitable”) can seem almost quaint, however catastrophic the consequences. Whatever its flaws, Official Secrets reminds us just how seriously the state took its pursuit of Gun, who had nothing to gain and everything to lose by raising the alarm, revealing the teeth behind the smarmy smiles."
The week in TV: Dublin Murders; Living With Yourself; Giri/Haji and more – reviews,"The BBC’s new cop hit brings brilliantly flawed humanity to familiar tropes, and Paul Rudd is literally at war with himself on Netflix",0,"Dublin Murders BBC One | iPlayerLiving With Yourself NetflixGiri/Haji BBC Two | iPlayerSuccession Sky Atlantic/Now TVWhy We Hate Discovery UKAre Our Politicians Up to It?: The Debate Channel 5Dublin Murders fell into a few traps, but rolled away from all of them, bloodily nicked but unbowed, to rise tall above ditches, below that grey perma-sky, and shine. It is, honestly, as good as everybody’s telling you.The chief shining is being done so far by virtue of the two main police partners in this particular murder squad actually liking each other, shock. Cassie (Sarah Greene) and Rob (Killian Scott) actually get on, sharing just-so dark humour and cheeky nips from a flask on harbour walls in 2006, when the Celtic Tiger was still all agleam with hubristic promise of gimcrack dockside flats. It’s a rare thing, to see such onscreen chemistry, the chemistry of strong, flawed friendship, probably last witnessed between Cormoran and Robin in Strike.The key word there was “flawed”: Rob Reilly is hugely compromised. Having been (it soon transpires) the child victim of unexplained savagery in 1985, he’s arguably the last murder-squad body on Earth who should be investigating another missing kid. Cassie’s also got her secrets; chiefly a buried stint undercover. By the third episode, a truly novel, exceptionally inspired, twist on the concept of “undercover identity” will emerge.There are intermittent shocks throughout this triumphant eight-part adaptation (two episodes a week), by Sarah Phelps, of Tana French’s bestselling Dublin Murder Squad crime novel series. There are the usual ones – ravens, ravening; weird things found weirdly in woods; a pig-sexist boss – but one of the most unsettling we encounter is Scott, in the shower, in a life-or-death struggle to uncrick his neck.No less terrifically human is Greene. Few others aside from perhaps Vera Stanhope could pull off her soft words over a dead child: “Oh sweetheart… your little face”.One sizable trap was that, yes, yawn, the first body found was that of a 13-year-old girl, found in the woods on an ancient stone altar (the second that of a pretty, half-naked student) and I wonder when writers will grow weary. (At least the writers here are female.) Also, when a young girl disappears, even in 2006, it’s kind of a big thing. The last one I covered was in Soham (2002), and I can still recall vividly the international media caravanserai haring late that hot Saturday to RAF Lakenheath, then filing on the run at 5.40 and having too many slow hours after my burbled cliches to reflect on the true enormity. In Knocknaree, there’s only one local reporter/photographer. All I’m trying to say is: this sort of thing really, and thankfully, is not that common. Personal quibbles apart, it’s still a winner.Living With Yourself is something of a tour de force for Paul Rudd. It’s the age-worn story of boy marries girl, boy becomes ground down by weary failures in lifelovework etc, boy clones self in dodgy Korean Top Happy Spa for $50k, happy best-he-can-be clone saunters home to impress wife, boss etc with newfound joie de vivre. And, of course, original boy wakes alive in grave, shakes shit from hair, walks eight miles in rain to join clone in pass-agg fight for career, wife, own life. Etc.Much, perforce, goes on, yet nothing feels hurried. At first sight it’s like an old Hollywood double-identity romcom, albeit with very good, very modern humour: truly funny, often. Yet Aisling Bea, as Miles’s wife Kate – in fact both Mileses’ wife Kate – is no wifely cipher. As this series gallops onward, it becomes clear that Kate’s going to have to choose between loser Miles and Miles 2.0: and there are big, big existential questions raised about authenticity versus (perceived) perfection. Truly, one for both old-Hollwyood aficionados and, pertinently, the selfie, Instagram age. I loved pretty much every moment, and all performances (Bea has been quite the find this summer): roll on more seasons.Giri/Haji is an immensely promising thriller set between Tokyo and London, and with a fine lead in Takehiro Hira as Kenzo Mori, a (compromised, obviously) detective on a quest in the UK capital. It’s violent, uncompromising and squirrelly, and Kenzo will, despite his corseted persona, find redemption in the outliers: rent boy Rodney (Will Sharpe), douce Sarah (Kelly Macdonald). The stylish anime flashbacks are a welcome addition to primetime drama.Succession ended with a gleeful setup for the third series. It was only afterwards that the downside struck: I’ll have months to wait before hearing, again, Nicholas Britell’s joyful and menacing theme music, arguably the song of the summer. Half of the concluding episode, on board Logan Roy’s (pointlessly huge, naturally, just cos he can) yacht, reminded me of little so much as a Poirot pre-unveiling, all the suspects gathered in the same space. If Poirot had been planning not to unveil a murder suspect but to throw a high-flying “blood sacrifice” of kith and kin to media and shareholders, and if those gathered had been encouraged to bitch and fornicate and swear with exuberant inventiveness throughout. Anyway: Logan threw son Kendall to the wolves. Kendall reciprocated. In style.I wrote at least one moon ago that Logan Roy was the part Brian Cox (not the space one) was born to play. By dint of humour, heft and that old-fashioned Scottish dichotomy of blending artsy creativity with hard-boned financial viciousness, he has made Roy his own, and made us root for, care about, a family which, in usual circumstances, I wouldn’t stop in the rain to scrape off my boot. An utter triumph: after Chernobyl and Spiral, my biggie so far of the year.In reviewing the big Channel 5 Wednesday-night Jeremy Vine thing – Live Brexit Debate: Deal or No Deal?, in which they’d polled 26,000 souls, biggest snapshot since June 2016 – I’d prepared the phrase “thick to the back teeth with Brexit”. Given the standard of most callers to Vine’s lively morning programme, I’d expected a concomitant studio audience.In the event I was prettily surprised: producers had split the tiers into segregated sections (a tip for Question Time?) of open remainers, Brexit ultras, those who’d voted pro-Europe but insist the referendum result demands respect, and so on. And, by and large they didn’t screech with crazed tribal madness but showed each other faint respect and spoke (some) welcome sense, the last bunch in particular.No, it was the guests who were the problem: Michael Howard, who tellingly spoke of the “1916 referendum”? Really? Howard?; and they’d dragged out, to arm-wave and get red-faced pro-Brexit business boss Tim Martin, who increasingly looks like a claymation dreamed up after too long in one of his Wetherspoon’s. Ann Widdecombe spat at Heidi Allen, Heidi spat at Widdy, and there was an intriguing spat, partly off camera, about the very poll itself. The SNP’s Joanna Cherry, a guest on the show, read out the overnight tweets of Prof John Curtice, who thought the ComRes poll used by the programme was flawed in allowing three options – leave with deal (30%), leave with no deal (20%), remain (42%) with the rest as don’t knows – to cloud the issue, rather than going for a simple rerun, to give a straight comparison with 2016.It got quite heated, the head of ComRes arguing with the disembodied tweets of Curtice via the ever-impressive Cherry. She was right, as was the prof, but, as with the thing itself, pointing out “the wrong question was asked in the first place” seldom makes for a scented bower of unity."
What You Gonna Do When the World’s on Fire? review – powerful social documentary,How violence and discrimination affect African American communities in the deep south,4,"Filmed in 2017, in African American communities in Mississippi and Louisiana shaken by a series of murders, beauty and chaos collide in this documentary by Roberto Minervini. Shot in stark black and white, the film bears witness to the lives of individuals touched by the long-simmering savagery on the streets. The characters include a pair of young brothers, a middle-aged woman struggling to keep a business afloat and a team who have united, in the face of police indifference, to protect people and investigate the endemic racially charged violence.Minervini’s is a camera that doesn’t tend to look away from the very worst moments, but even so, there are scenes here, in which he delves into the collective pain of the community, that make for more uncomfortable viewing than usual."
Zombieland: Double Tap review – a fan service sequel for fans who barely exist,A belated sequel to the 2009 sleeper hit brings back the main cast but can’t quite conjure up enough humour or charm to justify its existence,2,"At a relatively brief 99 minutes, Zombieland: Double Tap doesn’t provide one with anywhere near enough time to figure out exactly why Zombieland: Double Tap exists. The closest I could manage was sheer greed, but even that explanation would require a strongly held belief that a substantial fanbase cared about or even remembered the original. It was a decently reviewed sleeper success which provided a much-hankered-for eyeroll at the influx of zombie films flooding cinemas at the time – but it was that and little else. A smile of a movie that turned into more of a shrug over time.A decade wait later, the result of a tortuous development process, here it is, lumbering into cinemas thirsty for coins, missing the boat and all other available transport. It’s not entirely without merit, but it is utterly devoid of necessity, a release date filler that, despite the long gestation period, feels like a worthless quickie, 10 years’ worth of foreplay resulting in an underwhelming splurge. Since the first film, those involved have graduated to better things. Woody Harrelson scored two more Oscar nominations; Emma Stone won an Oscar and was nominated for another; Jesse Eisenberg secured himself a career as a playwright; screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick moved on to the Deadpool franchise; and director Ruben Fleischer landed Venom, the biggest hit of his career to date. Which makes the whole thing even more of a head-scratcher.Crafted with the sort of fan service one might expect from a sequel to a much-loved fan favourite, Zombieland: Double Tap doubles down on what the original provided for those apparently eagerly waiting for more. We’re reunited with the ragtag team from the first film as they come across an extravagant new home: the White House. For a while, there’s a fragile sense of contentment – for the men at least – but their attempts to force their female companions into traditional gender roles (the makeshift daughter and the loyal wife) force the women to flee the nest.What follows – what vaguely, if one squints, passes for a plot – includes a hippie commune, a pilgrimage to Graceland, a candle shop meet-cute and a lacklustre Luke Wilson cameo. Zombie groan.As dated as its slow-mo zombie-killing opening credits, at times Zombieland: Double Tap feels like it was made directly after the original yet carelessly forgotten about. It’s rushed and dusty, a film more belonging on Crackle than the big screen, more expensively budgeted than the first yet mostly creatively bankrupt. The film’s major addition is a dumb, one-note Valley Girl stereotype, played buoyantly by a game Zoey Deutch, who resembles a character from an early 00s sitcom, with every poorly written punchline landing the same – she’s an airhead, end of joke. The script’s potshots at hippies feel equally rusty: they love weed and hate guns. Cool.The returning actors replay the same beats with about as much effort and investment as one might expect, with Stone looking particularly bored, while Fleischer’s stylistic flourishes feel mostly regurgitated. The script’s interesting initial exploration of women eschewing traditional gender roles is soon replaced with a predictable string of women throwing themselves at undeserving men. It’s watchable in an undemanding way, thanks to a snappy pace, but there’s an ingenuity missing, a purpose, a spark that made the first film so much fun. A lot has changed since the first one came out, to the actors, to the genre, to the world, but Zombieland: Double Tap is hopelessly stuck in the past. It’s a corpse of a franchise that shows no sign of coming back to life.Zombieland: Double Tap is released in the UK and US on 18 October."
Lost Lives review – requiem for victims of the Troubles,"This powerful, elegiac documentary focuses on a monumental chronicle of 3,700 lives ended by violence in Northern Ireland",4,"Few films released in 2019 have seemed as timely or as urgent as Lost Lives. Documentarists Michael Hewitt and Diarmuid Lavery have come up with an immensely powerful film about a remarkable artefact: a thumping chronicle written over seven years that stands as an obituary of 3,700 lives taken during the Troubles in Northern Ireland.Hewitt and Lavery pull a scene-setting example from the book’s first pages: nine-year-old Patrick Rooney, killed in his bed by an RUC bullet during a riot in August 1969. In the film’s final moments, they add the name of Lyra McKee, the journalist shot by dissident Republicans during rioting in April 2019. Entry by entry, the film constructs a sorrowful history of promise extinguished and offers a pointed reminder of what lurks behind any rollback of the Good Friday agreement.This simple, effective conceit is given further heft by the who’s-who of Irish acting talent recruited to tackle the judicious, non-partisan phrasing of the five authors (David McKittrick, Seamus Kelters, Brian Feeney, Chris Thornton and David McVea). Ciarán Hinds lends the Rooney story new, tragic life; elsewhere, Adrian Dunbar, Susan Lynch and Kenneth Branagh sound understandably moved or appalled by the waste they describe.The variation of voices staves off any monotony inherent in the list format, and each story opens up some revealing front. Collectively, they provide a renewed sense of just how widespread and all-consuming the Troubles were, how they caught up combatants and civilians, young and old alike.Hewitt and Lavery wouldn’t have had to wander far into the archives for visual evidence of the taut, fraught Ireland of yesteryear, yet be warned: there are images here that couldn’t have been shown on the nightly news, interrupting the detachment instilled in the original prose.The film-makers create jolting contrast: the enduring beauty of the Irish landscape, against today’s gleamingly secure pleasure palaces, built after civil war was replaced by something like peace. Even here, though, Mark Garrett’s roaming camera detects a certain manmade melancholy, and those words and stories keep coming at us, their accumulated weight of detail socking the viewer in the gut and bringing tears to the eyes. Is this a book we really want to reopen? Lost Lives is released in the UK on 23 October, for one night only."
"Home review – gutsy doc charts harrowing, heroic journey by sea","Like Cheryl Strayed in Wild, Sarah Outen bravely explores mental health issues and grief as she chronicles her four-year round-the-world adventure",3,"The British adventurer Sarah Outen has made an introspective and emotionally brave film about her awe-inspiring journey around the world. She travelled 20,000 miles in four years, powered entirely by her own steam – on bike, foot and rowing boat. Documentaries about big adventures usually feature a scene or two in which the hero (usually male), with chest-beating bravado, goes mano a mano with nature. Not here. In Alaska, Outen giggles when a bear sneaks up on her having a wash. And it takes real guts to open up as she does about mental health issues in her elegant, self-aware voiceover.Her adventure begins in 2011 rowing across the Channel to France, and from there it’s five and half months on the bike. A recent Oxford graduate, Outen describes herself as confident and accomplished, but feeling lost and grieving the death of her father. In Kazakhstan, she falls for the landscape and the hospitality. People constantly invite her in for tea and ask: “Where is your husband?” She points to her bike, Hercules. Make no mistake, Outen is a tough lady, but her warmth and gentleness are as helpful while travelling so far alone. In China, she picks up a young lad, Gau, who has recently dropped out of business school – and for 2,000 miles to Beijing the film becomes a buddy comedy.Her adventure doesn’t go entirely to plan; a tropical storm at sea wrecks her boat and causes lasting emotional and physical harm. While recovering in the UK, Outen falls in love and asks herself what’s the point of going back to finish. Her film – co-directed with Jen Randall – shares with Cheryl Strayed’s memoir Wild a sense of the redemptive and healing power of travel. Outen also has the nerve to probe her motives: what is she running from and why is she always restlessly planning journeys? And she calls her boat Happy Socks, which is the most pleasing boat name since Boaty McBoatface. Home is released in the UK on 18 October."
Non-Fiction review – tale of literary passions loses the plot,"Olivier Assayas’s drama, set in the world of publishing, strains in vain to make zeitgeisty points about the future of books ",2,"Olivier Assayas is treading water with this amiable but self-indulgent and finally negligible movie (originally entitled Doubles Vies or Double Lives) about intrigue and adulterous goings-on in the publishing world of Paris.It’s a film that ostentatiously concerns itself with contemporary, zeitgeisty issues such as digital culture and the internet, and whether this is undermining the world of reading and books. But strip out the strained speechifying on that subject and it could have been made at any time in the last 40 years. There are some funny lines, and, despite the literary setting, Assayas can’t resist cinephile gags, particularly a bizarre juxtaposition of Star Wars: The Force Awakens with Michael Haneke’s searing drama The White Ribbon. But once we’ve reached an in-joke about the movie’s own female lead – Juliette Binoche – the film has started munching its own tail.Vincent Macaigne is Léonard, an author of middling literary fiction based on his own failed marriage and affairs. His sales are declining, and his urbane publisher Alain (Guillaume Canet) wants to drop him from his list; they have an excruciating lunch at which Alain can’t bring himself to say this out loud. But Léonard is having an affair with Alain’s wife, Selena (Binoche), whose loyal cheerleading on the home front may have been the only thing keeping Léonard’s career alive. Alain himself is having an affair with his head of digital policy, Laure (Christa Théret).Just as Léonard is periodically asked if he is writing “autofiction” and if this is a viable genre, so Assayas seems to be playing around with the idea of autofilm. There is one interesting line: brooding on online abuse rising as literacy falls, Léonard remarks about trolls: “The less they read, the more wary they are of writing.” Very true. Non-Fiction is released in the UK on 18 October."
Fractured review – twisty Netflix thriller is derivative but diverting,Sam Worthington searches for his family in a familiarly plotted yet mostly effective mystery from The Machinist director Brad Anderson ,3,"There’s a queasy sense of foreboding attached to the nervy Netflix thriller Fractured, partly because we know something sinister is afoot but mostly because we have been here before and we have a good idea of where we are headed. The film, from reliable genre tradesman Brad Anderson, recalls a great number of thrillers, from The Lady Vanishes to Flight Plan to Unknown to Shutter Island to Dream House, and at times it buckles under this comparative weight, a Frankenwork struggling to justify the reasons why it was stitched together in the first place.But when I wasn’t busying myself making an internal checklist of films I was reminded of, I was happily playing armchair detective, curious enough to engage with the pieces I was given. The film’s main pawn is Ray (Sam Worthington), a man travelling back from a disastrous family Thanksgiving with his wife, Joanne (Lily Rabe), and young daughter, Peri (Lucy Capri). It’s a tense journey, filled with clunky expository dialogue (at one point Joanne refers to him as “the guy that I married six years ago”) but there’s a twitchiness over what will happen, Anderson overlaying the mundanity with a devilish score and a grim, washed-out aesthetic. There follows a well-orchestrated accident, the specifics of which I won’t reveal, but Peri is left injured and the parents are left panicked, rushing her to the nearest hospital.But after dealing with the horrors of medical insurance (the film offers up a rarely dramatised example of the grinding bureaucracy involved with paying for one’s healthcare), Ray is faced with something far more horrifying. His daughter is sent for a scan, accompanied by his wife as he’s told to wait upstairs, but hours later, they’re nowhere to be found. Oh, and just to make things worse, the hospital claims that they were never there in the first place. Is Ray losing his mind? Is the hospital part of a sinister conspiracy? Is Sam Worthington able to emote?Anderson’s career is populated with closely filed genre variations. After two indie romcoms, he moved over to, and has stayed firmly on, the dark side, giving us eerily effective lo-fi horror (Session 9), dank and dreary neo-noir (The Machinist), snowy Hitchcockian suspense (Transsiberian), glossy race-against-time action (The Call), intriguing political espionage (Beirut) and gothic period chills (Stonehearst Asylum). Fractured sits comfortably alongside, probably closest to Transsiberian and The Call, with the wintry bleakness of the first and the involving propulsion of the latter. It never feels like much of a stretch for him but it’s also never less than watchable thanks to some unexpected directorial choices and a curious, compelling mystery at its centre. Given the familiar territory, it’s less a question of “Where will this go?” and more of “Which similarly plotted film’s twist ending will it most closely resemble?”, a less surprising game but a fun one nonetheless.Worthington, an actor of astoundingly limited range, makes for a bland Liam Neeson replacement but since his character spends most of the film confused and given how overstuffed the film is with plot, his vacant expression doesn’t prove to be a major distraction. He’s just a cog and the film is just a machine, slick but soulless and with parts in need of a touch-up. Not broken exactly, but more, ahem, fractured.Fractured is now available on Netflix"
Fanny Lye Deliver'd review – Maxine Peake has a folk-horror awakening,"A pair of druggy, licentious agitators invade a 17th-century Shropshire homestead in this eerie period melodrama from Brit indie director Thomas Clay ",3,"Thomas Clay is a British film-making talent who has been off the radar for a while, and cinema has been the duller for it. There had been nothing since his troubling and shocking debut The Great Ecstasy of Robert Carmichael in 2005 and the Bangkok-set followup Soi Cowboy in 2008. Now Clay has returned with a stark, bleak horror-melodrama of the English Revolution: a 17th-century period piece with eerie echoes of other genres: home invasion thriller, spaghetti western, folk horror, post-apocalyptic survivalist drama. It is a tough, disturbing watch about an ecstatic awakening through violence and – with a twinge – I wondered if Clay had returned to the shock rhetoric of his debut about a rape. As it happens there is emphasis placed here on consent.Like Peter Strickland, Clay is an authentically independent British film-maker who has come up outside the system and, like Strickland, incidentally, he has a fascination for the near-forgotten tropes and styles of 70s Brit cinema. With playful deadpan, Clay even begins with a spoof British Board of Film Censors certificate from the era, announcing that Fanny Lye Deliver’d has been passed with an “X-certificate” (I think our modern-day BBFC will in fact let it go at a 15).This could also be an allusion to 17th-century-set films made around this time, such as Kevin Brownlow’s Winstanley (1975) or Michael Reeves’s Witchfinder General (1968), with which it has quite a bit in common – although Clay’s witchfinder is allowed a few anachronisms from 2019, such as: “I’d lose the attitude if I were you ...”It is 1657, during Oliver Cromwell’s reign, and Maxine Peake plays Fanny Lye, a hardworking farmer’s wife somewhere in Shropshire where woodsmoke and the bleat of barnyard animals drift in the wind. She has learned to suppress her natural intelligence and inquiring mind through marriage to brutal Puritan ex-soldier John Lye, gloweringly and effectively played by Charles Dance. To impose his patriarchal discipline, Lye thinks nothing of taking the stick to their young son, Arthur (Zak Adams) or to Fanny herself.The family is astonished one Sunday when a naked man and woman appear, bruised and dishevelled, begging for shelter and claiming to have been robbed: Thomas (Freddie Fox) and Rebecca (Tanya Reynolds). With misgivings, and mollified by Thomas’s alleged military service, Lye allows them to stay, but then there are rumours of a couple wanted by the authorities for licentious orgies and subversive “leveller” preaching – spreading the scandalous notion that a woman may be as good as a man, and that Christianity should be a doctrine of love, not guilt. And so Thomas and Rebecca begin their revolutionary campaign of sensuality in the Lye household, starting with a glimmer of recognition in Fanny. But is the charismatic Thomas as purely dedicated to love as he claims?Fanny Lye Deliver’d is a film interestingly inspired, like so much art and popular culture about the period, by the great historian Christopher Hill and his mould-breaking 1972 book about radical ideas, The World Turned Upside Down. Clay’s script teasingly alludes to that title. Using the fascinating, subversive “underground” writings of the era, Hill taught us all to think of that time as a hotbed of blazing radicalism. Of course, it may be that the influence and reach of these texts has been exaggerated, to say the least – like historians 300 years in the future believing that in 1969 everyone was on LSD. But it is powerful to think of ideas as a kind of narcotic drug and sensual escape in this grim historical period. Ben Wheatley’s English Revolution film A Field in England (2013) had similar ideas – and Clay introduces “shrooms” into the parodic communion scene.It is an arresting film, although a bit programmatic, with narrative turns that can broadly be predicted. Yet the lead performance by Peake holds it together: fierce, strong, intelligent – a convincing depiction of someone who will learn from what she will survive."
The Creatress review – pretzel-shaped black comedy,"Lindy Booth is a literary novelist in this baffling, post-postmodern bookworld tale of sex and rivalry",3,"Decidedly weird – clearly intentionally so but not always in a good way – this pretzel-shaped black comedy stars Lindy Booth as a successful literary novelist named Eryn Bellow, first encountered working the bookstore promotional circuit via chauffeured cars and first-class flights. She’s not so much accompanied as pushed from behind by her caustic agent Carrie (Fran Drescher, a proper hoot who manages to infuse an impressive amount of disdain into the pronunciation of the word “macchiato”).But Eryn is blocked and can’t seem to land on a concept for her next book, the follow-up to The Chartreuse Misnomer, a name that in itself is a pretty good send-up of literary pretension. A bad-tempered spat with rival novelist Theo Mencken (Peter Bogdanovich) on a TV show precedes a strange diversion down a narrative rabbit hole that sees Eryn trying to live out scenes in another novelist’s book with sexual adventures with assorted guys (including Francis Lloyd Corby and Luke Guldan), Tinder stick-figures who end up all being part of some larger, even more bizarre meta narrative.It’s all a bit baffling, a little too post-postmodern for its own good. Writer-director Jason Cook’s script is sprinkled with a fair few sparky one-liners and nifty concepts, and the cast are a treat. But then there’s a flat, low-budget visual aesthetic, and a syrupy coating of clarinet-led score that makes it sound like a cheap made-for-TV movie from the early 1990s. It’s as if the whole thing is what you’d get if John Barth (The Sot Weed Factor) or Robert Coover (Pricksongs & Descants) had got a gig to write a script for a lesser American cable channel and didn’t care how it turned out."
Farming review – gritty tale of Nigeria's farmed-out kids,"Inspired by his own experiences, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje’s drama about black children adopted by white UK families is gruelling but intensely heartfelt ",3,"No punches are pulled in this gruelling film about racism – and incipient fascism – in late-60s Britain, which is also a parable for what people of colour have to do to fit in and get on. It’s an intensely personal, autobiographical work from actor-turned-director Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, inspired by his own childhood being “farmed”, or adopted, as many children with a Nigerian background were in the 60s and 70s, with white, working-class families in the UK. A little like Shola Amoo’s recent The Last Tree, Farming touches on the alienated experience of fostering and the culture shock of going back to Nigeria.Damson Idris plays Enitan, who was once a shy, dreamy kid but has grown into an angry teenager, bullied by racist skinheads; his foster mum, Ingrid (Kate Beckinsale) is indifferent. Desperate to find some sense of belonging and family, Enitan finds himself pathetically hero-worshipping the very skinhead thugs who persecute him. They take him on as a pet, and he begins to feel that he is rising through their ranks, although this is an illusion.Farming is a tough film on a tough subject. There’s not much light and shade – but there can’t have been much light and shade going through it in real life – and Gubu Mbatha-Raw’s role as the concerned teacher is weakly drawn.This could be compared to Shane Meadows’s This Is England (2006), although Akinnouye-Agbaje tellingly finds no redeeming features whatever in the white skinheads he portrays. Subtlety isn’t a feature here, but rather a combative need to face down the past, before embracing a future of hope. Farming is released in the UK on 11 October."
The Cotton Club Encore review – Francis Ford Coppola's reworked masterpiece,"Released in 1984 to mixed reviews and box office failure, the musical drama has been expanded in a masterly new presentation",5,"Francis Ford Coppola’s main revenue stream lately has been as a vintner. And as with a fine wine, his film The Cotton Club, first released in 1984 to a muted response, has blossomed with age.The Cotton Club Encore is an expanded rework of the original, from, in Coppola’s own words, a “less frightened, less easily bullied” director. Like the good bootlegger he is, he put half a million dollars of his own liquor money into this project. (A “presented by” credit also goes to the family of Las Vegas real estate mogul, Lorenzo Doumani.) Musical numbers which were excised from the previous release are restored. The studio also demanded that the storyline focused on the African American characters be reduced. This is given greater (though still not equal) footing now. At the time The Cotton Club was a box office dud and got one of its leads nominated for a Razzie. The Cotton Club Encore (plus 35 years of distance) is absolutely terrific.The Cotton Club was an institution of the Harlem Renaissance, where Duke Ellington and Cab Calloway (both given moments to shine in the film) revolutionized popular music. The performers were almost exclusively black and the clientele, at least at first, was only white. The first scene in the movie shows the great African American actor Woody Strode as the doorman turning away a potential patron for being too dark.The décor at the Cotton Club fetishized the black experience for its white audiences, with a Plantation-style set and exaggerated, sexualized murals. Yet on the stage one was given the privilege to witness black excellence. The secondary story in the movie is the arc of Sandman Williams (Gregory Hines), an enormously talented tap dancer. He catches his break at the club with an act featuring his brother (played by his actual brother, Maurice) and soon falls in love with Lila Rose (Lonette McKee), one of the light-skinned “Cotton Club Beauties”. In time, Lila Rose will struggle with whether to take advantage of her ability to pass as white and play the clubs outside of Harlem.Early on we see Sandman palling around with Dixie Dwyer (Richard Gere), a cornet player and good-natured Harlem resident. As a proxy for modern white audiences to feel secure that, yes, there were “some good ones” back then, Dwyer has no interest in bigotry, even if the Irish, Jewish and (eventually) Italian gangsters who run the club and its environs are quick to toss epithets around.This isn’t to imply that Dwyer is a saint. He’ll call a Jewish mob enforcer (played by Julian Beck) “that Golem” and sighs that he doesn’t want to be treated like an “N-word”. But the nuance found between a character’s environment and his intentions is part of, in my opinion, what makes good storytelling.Dwyer’s woes begin when he saves a man’s life. Turns out it is legendary bootlegger Dutch Schultz (James Remar). Schultz takes a liking to him, and hires him to play music at one of his parties. (Of note: Richard Gere actually plays cornet and piano himself in this movie, and he’s good!) Things get complicated when Dwyer is pressed into service as Schultz’s bodyman. He’s forced to chaperone Schultz’s girl Vera (Diane Lane in some outstanding period costumes) and, wouldn’t you know it, the two fall in love. The two actors have remarkable chemistry and cinematographer Stephen Goldblatt does not skimp on making the pair look gorgeous.Gangland mechanics and turf wars occupy a lot of the run time, and even though I’ve seen approximately 450,000 mob movies I still don’t really know how a “numbers racket” works. It’s no matter. There is an avalanche of terrific supporting roles, like Tom Waits as the Cotton Club’s stage manager, Gwen Verdon as Dwyer’s ex-hoofer mother, Nicolas Cage as Dwyer’s hot-headed younger brother (based on an actual gangster named “Mad Dog” Coll), Joe Dallesandro as “Lucky” Luciano and Laurence Fishburne as a character based on “Bumpy” Johnson. There’s also Bob Hoskins (as Owney Madden, the club’s owner) and Fred Gwynne (mobster “Big Frenchy” Demange). They are brutal criminals and murderers, yet they have an almost R2-D2/C-3P0 style look and relationship. When there isn’t blood spewing, there’s great warmth between them.Most importantly, though, The Cotton Club Encore is a jazz and tap dance exploitation film. The floorshow sequences aren’t quick clips, they are full performances. The Hines Brothers are the big winners, but there are a slew of dancers, singers and performers who deservedly get a moment in the spotlight. (A personal delight was seeing Jackée Harry doing some brassy comedy.)Though a theatrical run and Blu-ray release are planned, there’s no possible way Coppola is going to see a return on his investment here. This is a gift to cinephiles everywhere from deep in the cellar and we’re all lucky to get a sip.The Cotton Club Encore is showing at the New York film festival and will receive a US theatrical release on 11 October before a Blu-ray release on 15 November with a UK date yet to be announced"
Elvis Unleashed review – superfluous swagger from the comeback King,Presley’s return from seven years of acting in ropey movies to give these preening performances makes him seem petulant and outdated,2,"Last year, the famous 1968 Elvis Presley TV comeback special was released in cinemas to mark its 50th anniversary. Now here’s a superfluous documentary featuring outtakes from that film’s live sets. Rolling Stone recently described Elvis’s performance in the show as one of the greatest in rock’n’roll history. The King himself was reportedly so shook up by it that he ejaculated into his leather trousers. But I couldn’t help feeling underwhelmed, vaguely repelled even by his preening, smirky stage presence.In 1968, Elvis hadn’t performed live in seven years after switching to movies, acting in a succession of increasingly ropey productions. For the TV comeback he performed two unplugged sets plus two accompanied by a 45-piece orchestra, dressed throughout in uncomfy skintight black leather, chest exposed, hair slicked back. At 33, he’s still looking good – the days of bloated Vegas Elvis are still to come. But bequiffed and crooning “Do the chairs in your parlour seem empty and bare?” he must have looked seriously quaint to the youthful rebels of 1968.Still, the TV show was a triumph, proof that the King still had it. And there are some heartstopping moments in the acoustic sets as he jams rhythm and blues with his original bandmates, guitarist Scotty Moore and drummer DJ Fontana. But to be honest, the performance is all swagger and no soul, with Elvis displaying the spoilt petulant air of a man with a large entourage to maintain. And there is something stagey about his interactions with the audience – at one point asking for a handkerchief from a woman in the front row to mop his brow. I’d much rather watch the beautiful boy of 1956 shaping rock’n’roll with his sexually charged performances. This looks a bit like asking the Johnny Depp of today to act the role of Edward Scissorhands."
Joker review – the most disappointing film of the year,Why so serious? Todd Phillips’ solemn but shallow supervillain origins movie has a strong performance by Joaquin Phoenix but is weighed down by realist detail and tedious material,2,"The year’s biggest disappointment has arrived. It emerges with weirdly grownup self-importance from the tulip fever of festival awards season as an upscale spin on an established pop culture brand. Last year we had Luca Guadagnino’s solemn version of Suspiria, and now it’s Joker, from director and co-writer Todd Phillips: a new origin myth for Batman’s most famous supervillain opponent.Joaquin Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck, a pathetic loser and loner in Gotham City, some time in the early 1980s. Arthur is a former inpatient at a psychiatric facility but is now allowed to live with his elderly mother, Penny (Frances Conroy), in her scuzzy apartment. Poor Arthur has a neurological condition that means he is liable to break into screeching laughter at inopportune moments. He has a crush on his single-mom neighbour Sophie (Zazie Beetz) and pines to be a comedian, hero-worshipping cheesy TV host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro). But he can only get a job as a clown in grinning makeup and floppy-toed shoes twirling an advertising banner outside a store, where he is bullied and beaten up by young thugs passing by. One day, after the humiliation and despair become too much to bear, Arthur gets hold of a gun and discovers that his talent is not for comedy but violence.Phillips has already directed a film featuring a brilliant unfunny-funny figure with learning difficulties: Alan in The Hangover, played by Zach Galifianakis, that strange dysfunctional figure who mispronounces the noun “retard”. I wonder what Joker would be like with Galifianakis in the lead. Well, the casting of Phoenix indicates more clearly how sexy Joker is supposed to be.There is great production design by Mark Friedberg, some tremendous period cityscape images by cinematographer Lawrence Sher, and a strong performance by Phoenix, though not his best – it is not as good as his appearance in Paul Thomas Anderson’s The Master. The film holds your attention up until Joker’s terrible revenge bloodbath on the subway early on, perhaps intended to echo the notorious Bernhard Goetz shooting of 1984 – although Phillips prudently makes it a non-racist attack. After this, the film loses your interest, with tedious and forced material about Joker’s supposed triggering of an anti-capitalist, anti-rich movement with protesters dressing as clowns. Joker’s own criminal and serial-killer career bafflingly fizzles.The film makes reference to movies from around the drama’s era, such as the Death Wish films, The French Connection and maybe even Star Wars, but it’s more obviously a laborious and pointless homage to the Scorsese/De Niro classic The King of Comedy with a bit of Taxi Driver, which means that at various moments it’s a bit like The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver, only not as good.The connection is signalled by the casting of De Niro himself, but it is nonetheless unearned and pedantic, especially compared to Lynne Ramsey’s You Were Never Really Here, also starring Phoenix as a loner living with his mom, which managed the connection more adroitly.The whole idea of the malign clown should be very relevant. We live in an era of trolling, incels and internet bullying. (The grisly Milo Yiannopoulos described himself as a “supervillain” on his now cancelled Twitter bio.) There’s nothing wrong and everything right with engaging with all of this – and the “copycat” row is a red herring. But, perhaps because online aggression is difficult to dramatise, Phillips understandably wanted his film to be set in a pre-web age. Yet he cheats an anachronistic quasi-YouTube moment into his story when a video of Arthur’s catastrophic attempt at standup comedy somehow emerges. (I wonder if there wasn’t an earlier, contemporary-set draft of the script.)This Joker’s genesis is determinedly mature and uncartoony, compared to, say, Jack Nicholson’s low-level crook Jack Napier falling into a chemical vat in Tim Burton’s Batman, turning him into the Joker with white skin, green hair and a rictus grin. (The look of DC’s Joker was originally inspired by Conrad Veidt in the 1928 silent classic The Man Who Laughs, a man whose face was disfigured into a grin by his father’s political enemies.)There is no reason why Phoenix’s elaborately backstoried Joker shouldn’t be as powerful as Heath Ledger’s mysterious, motiveless, originless Joker in The Dark Knight. But at some stage the comic-book world of supervillaindom has to be entered, and Ledger was more powerful because he wasn’t weighed down with all this realist detail and overblown ironic noir grandeur, and he wasn’t forced to carry an entire story on his own. This Joker has just one act in him: the first act. The film somehow manages to be desperately serious and very shallow."
Citizen K review – strange tale of the oligarch who became Putin's nemesis,Alex Gibney’s absorbing new documentary about Mikhail Khodorkovsky charts the Russian businessman’s transformation from plutocrat to political dissident,4,"If Vladimir Putin is the enigmatic Mr Hyde of 21st-century Russia, then Mikhail Khodorkovsky is its Dr Jekyll. He’s an oligarch, a plutocrat, a political player and a contemporary of Putin who nonetheless seems to be the good guy. He appears entirely sincere in his commitment to democratic reforms in Russia and seems to float free of the glowering gangster code of omertà that governs all those who enriched themselves at Putin’s tsarist court. Khodorkovsky first became wealthy as the proprietor of Russia’s first private bank in the Yeltsin 90s. Then he participated in the country’s privatisation scam, whereby impoverished Russian citizens were forced to sell their valuable share certificates to Khodorkovsky and his ilk for a song; Khodorkovsky and others finally loaned money to the near-bankrupt state in return for the right to buy up national utilities later at bargain-basement prices.Alex Gibney’s absorbing new film shows his remarkable metamorphosis throughout this. While all the other post-Soviet wiseguys just bulked up and looked ever more morose and fractious (there is a startling glimpse of Roman Abramovich who has this characteristic oligarch sulk-frown) Khodorkovsky became smilingly sleek and telegenic as he voiced his political concerns. With close-cropped hair, rimless spectacles and a black sweater tucked into his blue jeans, he looked like a combination of Steve Jobs and Jerry Seinfeld.Meanwhile, Putin’s face seems ever more puffy and waxy, perhaps the result of having had cosmetic work done. In his London exile, where he sponsors anti-Putin activism, Khodorkovsky seems untroubled by the fact that so many Putin critics have met violent ends in the UK. It may still happen to him – something this new documentary does not directly address. Khodorkovsky is shown getting London tubes and trains on his own, like a British commuter, with no obvious security guards. But surely he must travel with at least two or three burly guys.His easygoing calm has something to do with having been put in prison in 2003 – after challenging Putin on the corruption issue – on trumped-up charges of tax evasion and embezzlement. As the film about him acidly points out, these accusations could hardly be more meaningless: the wealth and prestige of the mega-Croesus class that governs Russia is founded on wholesale larceny of state assets. Khodorkovsky repeatedly threatened hunger strike in prison and was ready to face death. After 10 years, Putin freed him. Whether Putin likes it or not (and of course he doesn’t), Khodorkovsky’s talent for communication, his flair for television and political rhetoric and the very fact of having served a prison sentence widely seen as unjust makes him look like a Dostoevsky or a Solzhenitsyn for our time.But the fact remains that Khodorkovsky is a Putin-vintage oligarch and he didn’t get that rich by being a nice guy. The Putin government has repeatedly tried to suggest that Khodorkovsky was involved in the 1998 murder of Vladimir Petukhov, the mayor of Nefteyugansk, the remote Siberian town where Khodorkovsky had enraged Petukhov by laying off thousands of local workers employed by his oil company, Yukos. Gibney takes it as read that it had nothing to do with Khodorkovsky, and indeed nothing was proved.The last film about him, Cyril Tuschi’s Khodorkovsky, was a semi-dramatised documentary that was made in 2011 when he was still in prison and it conferred on its subject more of a tragic mystique than Gibney’s film. This one interviews Khodorkovsky in his London exile as if things are basically settled, at least as far as he is personally concerned. Perhaps that is true and perhaps not. I felt that Gibney had not exactly solved the sphinx riddle of Khodorkovsky’s seraphic calm; he does not question him closely about his personal life.But his film does present Khodorkovsky in context in a way that I haven’t seen before. He was the oligarch smart enough – and ruthless enough – to do as well or better than anyone in the Yeltsin/Putin free-for-all years, and then his smartness and ruthlessness perhaps gave him a perspective on it all. I think he simply became bored with mega-riches and, instead of buying a football team or buying power, what Khodorkovsky bought was criticism-of-power, a position of prominent dissidence normally afforded to writers and artists, and which Khodorkovsky achieved semi-accidentally through imprisonment, which he met with stoicism. What a strange story – and it’s not over yet."
Skin review –  tattooed neo-Nazi turns his face from evil,"In this earnest, if limited drama, Jamie Bell plays a far-right footsoldier trying to quit a white-power cult after he falls in love",3,"Jamie Bell’s tough performance carries this forthright, earnest, if limited drama, based on the true story of a far-right American skinhead called Bryon Widner and his attempts to leave a neo-Nazi white-power cult. This involved the agonising removal of his grotesque facial tattoos with their various Hitlerian symbols and fantasy nordic insignia. It’s a vivid metaphor for the denazification process.The film is written and directed by Israeli-born film-maker Guy Nattiv (working from a TV documentary called Erasing Hate). He was an Oscar-winner this year for his short film, Skin – which has no relation to this feature, other than a shared thematic concern with racial conflict.Bell plays Widner and Danielle Macdonald is excellent as Julie, the woman with three children with whom he falls in love and who encourages him to make the break with the creepy Nazis. Mike Colter plays Daryle Jenkins, the anti-fascist activist who works to “turn” extremists and helps to bring Widner in from the cold.The drama involves a tricky balancing act. Widner has to be just enough of a Nazi bad guy so that we can appreciate his journey away from evil; but not so much of a Nazi that he stops being relatable. In fact, we never see him do anything purely horrible on his own. He is part of a brutal assault on a black teenager at a demo, which he appears instantly to regret, and an attack on a Muslim community centre whose horrendous effects he tries to minimise. Otherwise, the film presents him as the “good” neo-Nazi skinhead, disgusted by the brutal “bad” neo-Nazi skinheads.It’s a curious spectacle, but when far-right footsoldiers want out, this might well be what happens. The visual impact of Widner without his tattoos is the point of the film: the image of humanity restored. Skin is released in the UK on 27 September."
Sea of Shadows review – porpoise documentary slips through the net,National Geographic’s film about the endangered vaquita – victim of Mexican gangsters’ search for ‘the cocaine of the seas’ – is a wasted opportunity,2,"The sad plight of the vaquita – an endangered species of porpoise to be found in the Sea of Cortez off the Mexican coast – is the subject of this earnest, but frankly rather precious and slightly self-admiring documentary from National Geographic, executive-produced by Leonardo DiCaprio. It is heartfelt, but its periodic attempts at thriller-style bouts of excitement are redundant, and I wondered sometimes if the film-makers were sure what exactly their story was.There are now estimated to be only 15 vaquita left in the world, and the reason they are dying is that they are getting caught in the nets of those who are illegally trying to catch totoaba, a fish that swims in the same waters, and whose swim bladder is much prized in China, both as a delicacy and for its supposed medicinal value.So the totoaba is now called “the cocaine of the seas” and cartel gangsters are heavily involved in fishing for it, and transporting it to Hong Kong. The film shows clearly enough how dangerous and ugly this criminal connection is, and how worrying is the evidence that police and navy personnel are vulnerable to bribery. But there are other things going on, too.Legitimate fishing communities are enraged that their business is being sacrificed in the crackdown, and some are openly mutinous towards the authorities, because they say that they and their livelihoods are endangered.The film is not sure quite what to do with this interesting debate, and simply dispenses with it. Only late in the film, and very ineffectually, does it get round to the obvious point: how can Mexico persuade China to crack down on their own appetite for totoaba, which, as with the market for elephant tusks, is driving the whole business? The film doesn’t give this issue nearly enough attention. A wasted opportunity. Sea of Shadows is released in the UK on 27 September."
Tomorrow review – sorry tale of broken-hearted war veteran,"A British soldier returning from a traumatic tour of duty tries to make a new life in this earnest, uninvolving melodrama",2,"In this maladroit, earnest London-set melodrama, former British soldier Tesla (Sebastian Street) comes home from Afghanistan with paralysed legs, a bad case of PTSD, and a broken heart, having been dumped by his girlfriend while he was on tour. But things start looking up for him after he befriends well-connected but workshy bon viveur Sky (Stuart Brennan) – whom we’re guided to think of as really erudite because he immediately connects the name Tesla to the Serbian electrical pioneer, not to the electric car company.Eventually, the two blokes start double dating flatmates Katie (Stephanie Leonidas), a business studies student who wants start a restaurant and put her new squeeze Tesla in the kitchen, and Lee-Anne (Sophie Kennedy Clark), an aspiring artist producing woefully pedestrian sketches and photos.Written by co-stars Street and Brennan (who also produced), Tomorrow is largely uninterested in the feelings and motivations of its women: they are merely catalysts for the dramas centred on the guys. In Tesla’s case, it all has to do with his trauma and the challenges he faces in being taken seriously as a chef, a worthy enough storyline that also presents his sex life with Katie as relatively uncomplicated and satisfying. Meanwhile, Sky has a dark secret that makes him mysteriously jumpy about intimacy but which his girlfriend and father (James Cosmo) are absurdly slow to work out.Near the end, Stephen Fry toddles into the story to provide public-service-style advice. Indeed, the movie plays in part like a kind of state-funded docudrama, boosting body positivity and healthy-living tips for the differently abled and those with less visible conditions.It’s a nice message, but Martha Pinson’s direction is bland and functional, and, even though they wrote the dialogue, the male leads struggle to deliver the lines with much conviction, making this a bit like a vanity project that’s not even that flattering. Tomorrow is released in the UK on 27 September."
Sturgill Simpson: Sound & Fury review – country's outlaw catches fire,"(Elektra Records)Another big shift in direction for Simpson, with anime visuals, glam rock, disco and grunge ornamenting never-more-country lyrics: it’s extraordinary",5,"It seems almost beside the point to note that Sturgill Simpson’s fourth album sounds nothing like its predecessors, as his previous three albums didn’t sound much like each other either. His self-funded 2013 debut, High Top Mountain, suggested the arrival of an arch-traditionalist, a former serviceman and railroad worker, whose vision of country music was rooted in that of artists who balked at Nashville’s tendency to slather everything in a coat of gloss: a defiantly retro reanimation of the late 70s “outlaw country” of Waylon Jennings or Hank Williams Jr. But its successor, Metamodern Sounds in Country Music, was a kind of psychedelic opus, sprinkled with paeans to LSD and DMT – “woke up this morning and decided to kill my ego … gonna break on through and blast off to the Bardo,” opened Just Let Go – frequently set to music that matched: Mellotron and wah-wah guitars, vocals drenched in spaced-out echo.2016’s A Sailor’s Guide to Earth, meanwhile, was a heavily orchestrated concept album that bore the influence of 60s southern soul and featured a cover of Nirvana’s In Bloom, recast as a small-hours ballad, heavy on the weeping pedal-steel. It won best country album at the Grammys, and was nominated for album of the year outright. Cementing his reputation as something of a refusenik, Simpson threatened that if he won, he would simply hand the award to Beyoncé and walk out.Notice has clearly been served that whatever you think the 41-year-old Simpson is, that’s what he’s not, but even so, Sound & Fury is a bold and dramatic left turn: a self-styled “sleazy synth-rock dance record”, that Simpson has claimed is inspired not merely by T Rex, but, of all people, La Roux.Given Simpson’s previously noted unbiddable nature – and indeed Sound & Fury’s preponderance of lyrics that wrestle unhappily with the fame occasioned by A Sailor’s Guide to Earth’s success and with the machinations of the music industry, or as Mercury in Retrograde puts it, “hypocrites building brands” – you do wonder if announcing that his new album is influenced by a foppish glam idol who made virtually no commercial impact in the US and an androgynous British synthpop revivalist doesn’t come with a gleeful side-order of screw-you to the country establishment. Whatever the reason, he’s not kidding, as evidenced by single Sing Along: a wall of crunching glam guitars and fizzing analogue synths, underpinned by a frantic four-to-the-floor disco beat, with a vague hint of the drum machine-driven fuzz found on ZZ Top’s Eliminator stirred into the mix.And if Simpson is as discomfited by success and critical praise as Mercury in Retrograde suggests – journalists and people asking what his songs mean seem to rank only slightly higher in his estimation than hypocrites building brands – then unfortunately, he’s going to have to suck it up for a little while longer. Sing Along, like the rest of Sound & Fury, is awesome: powerful, fierce, irresistible.Apparently recorded while films by Japanese director Akira Kurosawa played silently in the studio, the album is the soundtrack to its own film, an anime loosely based on Kurosawa’s samurai epic Yojimbo. Without wishing to cause despair to whoever ponied up the film’s $1.2m, Sound & Fury is better heard stripped of its visual accompaniment. Without it, the album’s structure becomes thrillingly inexplicable and unpredictable: its songs frequently don’t end, or at least reach any kind of identifiable conclusion. They just crash into the next track as if someone’s frantically switching channels on a TV, or suddenly fade out, replaced by bursts of feedback and electronic noise or burbling synthesiser arpeggios.Before that happens, the songs have already done enough to get their hooks in you. Every track, from the agitated faux-rockabilly of Last Man Standing to the fabulous combination of distinctly Bolan-esque boogie and world-weary tune offered up on Make Art Not Friends, to All Said and Done, a wracked ballad that crackles and hisses with distortion, is an object lesson in musical economy. In contrast to the complexity of A Sailor’s Guide to Earth, they offer beautifully simple, direct melodies and indelible riffs buoyed by the needles-in-the-red intensity of the production and by the way Simpson’s frequently down-home lyrics – “Tell ’em to carve my name on that bar stool, baby, / I’m gonna be here a while” – rub against the wilfully synthetic but visceral nature of the sound.It climaxes with Fastest Horse in Town, a psychedelicised take on old-fashioned, pre-Nevermind grunge: dense, corrosive guitars howling and arcing around Simpson’s voice, the latter rendered incomprehensible with reverb and electronic effects. It’s a hugely exciting end to a hugely exciting album that underlines Simpson’s status as a daring, restless and unique artist. He isn’t the first musician to throw his label a curveball while protesting about the pressures of fame and the grim nature of the music business. That said, it’s hard to think of anyone else who’s done it by making an album as gripping and enjoyable as this.Holodrum: No DitherStraight out of Halifax: fidgety, sax and synth-driven punk-disco that takes on an increasingly psychedelic sheen as it progresses."
Rambo: Last Blood review – Stallone storms Mexico in a laughable Trumpian fantasy,"The grizzled warrior dusts off his crossbow to take revenge on sex traffickers in a creaking, cringeworthy fifth instalment ",1,"This massively enlarged prostate of a film can only make you wince with its badly acted geronto-ultraviolence, its Trumpian fantasies of Mexican rapists and hilariously insecure US border, and its crass enthusiasm for rape-revenge attacks undertaken by a still-got-it senior dude, 73 years young, on behalf of a sweet teenager. The film, co-written by Sylvester Stallone, imagines this demure young woman having her face slashed by an assailant but the field is left clear for a stag payback showdown; there is no question of her taking her own retributive action.Stallone’s own impassive face, now like a sculpture created by Picasso out of a Firestone tyre, presides enigmatically over the proceedings and his indistinct line readings would not get him very far in rep. His announcement of “I want you to feel my rage and my hate; I want to rip out your heart!” comes out more like “Ug wuff yuh tahfarr m’range an mayayyht, ug wuff trip ertcha heurr!”In the likable Creed movies, Stallone had found a way for his legendary boxing champ Rocky Balboa to bow out with humour and humility: as a trainer. But there is no such style in this new Rambo film, the fifth in the franchise, which despite its name may not be the last: over the final credits there is a sentimental greatest-hits montage of Rambo moments over the years, ending with an unexpected present-day shot of John Rambo riding off into the sunset on his horse. Are there more battles still to be won for this great warrior?Nowadays Rambo is living on an Arizona farmstead in retirement, breeding horses. (There is some show-offy but undeniably impressive horsemanship from Stallone here.) He also weirdly maintains an underground network of survivalist tunnels, in which he broods over his collection of weapons. Not surprisingly, these occasionally cause the old boy anxious flashbacks, resembling as they do the tunnels created by the Viet Cong, whom he fought in Vietnam. He is close to his Mexican housekeeper Maria (Adriana Barraza) and to her orphaned niece Gabrielle (Yvette Monreal), whom soft-hearted Rambo thinks of as his own kin. But when Gabrielle gets word that her no-account dad, who abandoned the family, is still alive and living in Mexico, she impulsively heads south of the border to find him and winds up being kidnapped as a sex slave by a Mexican cartel. Rambo tools up and saddles up to get her back.The result is cringemakingly written and clunkily directed, and even the final action sequence runs out of steam after a minute or so. Of course, other dramas are arguably vulnerable to the charge of demonising Mexico, such as the Sicario movies and Nicolas Winding Refn’s TV series Too Old to Die Young; but they are thrillers composed with satirical brilliance and icy power. It is the streak of flabby sentimental self-importance that makes Rambo: Last Blood unwatchable. Please, Sly: more Balboa, less Rambo.Rambo: Last Blood is released on 19 September in Australia and the UK and on 20 September in the US."
Best Before Death review – KLF's Bill Drummond bakes cakes for the world,"The peppery artist and musician embarks on a quest to create performance art across the globe in this engaging, sometimes hilarious documentary",4,"Paul Duane’s intriguing and sometimes hilarious documentary is about artist and musician Bill Drummond – formerly of the pop band the KLF – who is now on what he describes as The 25 Paintings World Tour. Starting at Spaghetti Junction, Birmingham, the tour will take in 12 cities, in each of which Drummond will create and enact various performance-art pieces, including crossing a bridge banging a drum, getting a shave, baking cakes (and handing them round), shining people’s shoes and making a bed from locally sourced wood and giving that away.It is all about the process, not the product, and in so far as all this is leading to an artwork, it is the resulting portfolio of photographs that are being taken – though Drummond is himself unsure about this part of things.Duane’s film follows him in Kolkata and Lexington, and interestingly conveys Drummond’s difficult, peppery, supercilious side. When bemused members of the public ask him reasonable questions, he sometimes behaves like a polite VIP nearing the end of his tether at how stupid people are – and comes close to outright Alan-Partridge-type rudeness.There is a terrifying moment when Drummond describes his plan to do the tour in Jerusalem and then go on to Damascus, adding that this isn’t going to happen until 2025, by which time he hopes that peace will be restored. We all hope that, but it would perhaps be prudent to wait until complete calm has been re-established.At the very end, however, Drummond says something brilliant, something that should be on T-shirts: “Life is too short to be wasted on the pursuit of happiness.” And that explains a lot about Drummond and his Zen creative quest: not for happiness, but for the circumstances in which happiness will come to him. Best Before Death is released in the UK on 23 September."
Ad Astra review – Brad Pitt on a thrilling Freudian space odyssey,"With echoes of Apocalypse Now and 2001, James Gray’s spectacular epic dispatches Pitt on an interplanetary mission to find his missing father",4,"Brad Pitt never looked more beautiful than in this mesmeric, flawed, superbly photographed and designed space adventure from director and co-writer James Gray. Pitt plays an astronaut in what is tantalisingly described as the “near future” and Gray’s camera traces the scorched and incised surfaces of distant planets with the same awe that it travels across Brad’s face, savouring the lattice of tiny wrinkles around the eyes, and the discreet harvest of his one-day stubble.Gray’s direction, like Pitt’s performance, is fiercely intended and intricately controlled and the resulting movie has some of the epic and Conradian qualities of his last film, The Lost City of Z – though with a more satisfying structure and story arc, and with more exciting set pieces. It is, perhaps, a little derivative and maybe finally fudges the dark mystery of the quest’s end point. But this is a film with thrilling ambition and reach.Pitt plays Major Roy McBride, an astronaut impeccably cool under pressure, and with a dedication to the job that has perhaps cost him his marriage to Eve (a mute and largely flashback-centred cameo for Liv Tyler). Roy is, moreover, the son of revered astronaut Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones), who taught his boy the values of hard work and emotional self-control, and who became legendary on the news of his death decades ago while heading up a pioneer exploratory project near Neptune. Roy demonstrates his own sang-froid while repairing a rig the height of seven skyscrapers, which begins to shudder under the impact of a terrifying power surge, until McBride free-climbs out to shut off the voltage: a quite stunning opening sequence.His superiors consider that now is the moment to tell Roy that his father may still be alive, having somehow gone rogue or gone native in deep space, and is causing these terrifyingly dangerous surges. It is now Roy’s mission to voyage out there and confront his father. His own emotional blankness begins to disappear as the truth of his father’s existence begins to dawn, along with a suspicion that his superiors are not telling him the whole story.Ad Astra (from the Latin tag “per ardua ad astra” or “through struggle to the stars”) is a spectacular, immersive picture, offering an intelligent and deeply considered variation on existing themes. Obviously, there is something of Coppola’s Apocalypse Now, with Roy making a terrifying upriver journey to sacrifice or “terminate the command” of this patriarch-god – or is it his own command he’s going to terminate? The syntax and grammar of space travel on film owes something to Kubrick’s 2001, a film importantly conceived when space discovery was a matter of imminent fact, not fantasy, though Gray has his own distinctive vision. There’s a witty and shrewd depiction of the moon as extensively colonised and commercialised, like a banal shopping centre.Yet perhaps the most interesting comparison is with Terrence Malick, particularly The Tree of Life, where Pitt is playing the father and Sean Penn is the grownup son, and the journey – the journey we all make – is into the past, into the treacherous territory of our own memories. It is when Ad Astra becomes disorientating and hallucinatory that it is most Malickian.As to its accuracy, it’s reassuring that the film is not weighed down with preposterous and pseudo-scientific explanations. The idea of Clifford being able to cause “power surges” is not plausible on this realist level, but it works as a parable or a dream.Gray’s incidental details and characters are very good. Donald Sutherland has an enigmatic cameo as Colonel Pruitt, an old friend of Roy’s dad, who has been ambiguously called in for guidance or surveillance. Ruth Negga is excellent as the disquietingly intense Helen Lantos, who has personal reasons for hating Clifford, which in a complicated way are the reasons for wanting to help Roy. Quite aside from the gasp-inducing and vertiginous opening sequence, there is a gripping encounter with hostile moon buggies and a nightmarishly choreographed attack in a spacecraft that had been used for animal research. Here is where the movie is not just Freudian, but Darwinian.I wondered, just a little, if Pitt could have surrendered more to the emotions the film was invoking, or if the ideas underpinning the climax were a bit too familiar. But his performance anchors the whole movie: a still, calm centre with the pure physical ease and charm of an intergalactic Gary Cooper. The film is itself an almighty power surge. Ad Astra is released in the UK on 18 September, in Australia on 19 September and in the US on 20 September."
Solaris review – love and loneliness collide in best take yet on sci-fi classic,"Royal Lyceum, EdinburghDavid Greig follows Tarkovsky and Soderbergh with this bold, rewarding take on Stanisław Lem’s novel about a sentient planet speaking to its visitors",4,"If a sentient planet existed, it would be unfathomably hard to explain. How to put into words a consciousness so vast, ancient and alien? We’d struggle to begin.It seems only right, then, that each time it is told, the story of Solaris shifts in shape. First, came the 1961 novel by Stanisław Lem, coupling dense tracts of tech-speak with an unknown terror worthy of Edgar Allan Poe. Where the 1972 Tarkovsky movie was spare and reflective, the 2002 Soderbergh version was all about the wish-fulfilment romance between George Clooney, as a newly arrived spaceman, and Natascha McElhone, an apparition of his former wife.Likewise, David Greig’s adaptation, the most satisfying of them all, is its own thing. Although rooted in the novel, it takes bold and rewarding liberties with character and plot. This is partly to make theatrical sense; the crew of the playwright’s gender-balanced spaceship are now talkative instead of taciturn, their attempts to understand the watery planet a collegiate enterprise, the better for us to know what’s going on.It’s partly also to home in on the themes of loneliness, communication and unknowability. In Greig’s version, Solaris learns to talk to its visitors step by step, manifesting itself in increasingly sophisticated ways. First, it sends gifts of Earth-like objects, and eventually emissaries in human form.The more real these manifestations become, the greater the existential crisis. Polly Frame, excellent as psychologist Kris, is emotionally torn when Keegan Joyce appears as long-lost boyfriend Ray. He is as attractive and as inscrutable as the planet itself. Pulled in two directions – by scientific rigour and human passion – Kris sees an escape from loneliness in the very thing that will make her more isolated. Matters are no easier for Ray, a personality without a past, slowly destroyed by self-awareness.All this is consummately staged by Matthew Lutton in a co-production with Melbourne’s Malthouse theatre, bringing a human scale to the otherworldly seascapes and arid spaceship interiors created by designer Hyemi Shin and the technical team. With its sharp, cinematic cuts and rumbling waves of sound, Solaris troubles and tantalises. At Royal Lyceum, Edinburgh, until 5 October, then at Lyric Hammersmith, London, 10 October to 2 November."
"Night Hunter review – sicko serial killer, meet the vigilante castrator",Henry Cavill hunts a split-personality murderer in this throwaway throwback to the days of straight-to-video shlock,2,"These days, most younger readers probably don’t even understand the meaning of “straight to video”. But back in the day, it was a label slapped on films, often genre fare, so unloved by even their rights holders that only contractual obligation ensured they would see the light of day. This crime thriller, with its lurid serial-killer conceit and a cast peppered with talents who must have just needed the money, is a nostalgic throwback to those straight-to-video guilty pleasures of yore.Henry Cavill glowers manfully throughout as a hardened detective named, with on-the-nose nominative determinism, Marshall, pursuing a sicko in Minnesota who kidnaps and imprisons young women in his dank torture dungeon, damaging their hearing in order to play out his compulsions. The twist is that Marshall and his colleagues, including police commissioner Harper (a slumming Stanley Tucci) and forensic psychologist Rachel (Alexandra Daddario), appear to capture the killer within the first half-hour. He is a weedy gibbering shell of man named Simon (Brendan Fletcher, chewing carpet, linoleum, astrotur) who was himself the victim of terrible childhood trauma. Rachel reckons that Simon has a disassociative personality disorder and if she could get one of his alternate personalities to talk to her they could crack innumerable cold cases.Meanwhile, Ben Kingsley plays a retired judge turned vigilante – with an absurdly sophisticated aptitude for hi-tech gadgets and seemingly unlimited financial resources – who is working with beauty bait Eliana Jones to lure sexual predators into their trap so they can castrate them. The storylines inevitably intersect. Of course, there’s a big daft twist that the writers of Scooby-Doo might have looked askance at. This is such twaddle it becomes kind of fun, except that there’s an uncomfortable feeling – as with many vigilante movies – that the film is revelling in the sexual violence and covering itself with the fig leaf of justice-seeking. Night Hunter is released in the UK on 13 September."
Mrs Fletcher review – Kathryn Hahn charms in thought-provoking comedy,"A HBO series based on Tom Perrotta’s excellent novel about porn and consent offers up wit, intelligence and a remarkable central performance",4,"There’s something about the work of the American novelist Tom Perrotta that makes it ideally suited for adaptation, a complex and quite often hugely frustrating process. There are lauded authors, such as Philip Roth, James Joyce and Virginia Woolf, whose books haven’t survived the journey quite so well, time and time again, yet Perrotta has a flawless, if limited, track record. His stinging high school satire Election became one of 1999’s most acclaimed films before the darkly comic suburban drama Little Children brought one of Kate Winslet’s best performances to date and most recently, HBO’s ambitious three-season extension of The Leftovers was met with a rapturous reception.He’s sticking with the channel for a new limited series based on his most recent, and arguably best, novel, Mrs Fletcher, a hugely engrossing and deftly structured book about a woman and her son dealing with sex in very different ways. Eve (Kathryn Hahn) is preparing herself for a change and it’s one that she isn’t happy with or ready for, the result of her son leaving home for college. Brendan (Jackson White) is ready to leave, ready for his life as a popular and desirable high school jock to continue in a different, less restrained, location. Like the book, the show follows them both as they make their way through exciting and dangerous new phases.The success of Perrotta’s big and small screen incarnations has a great deal to do with Perrotta himself, the author deciding to take a key role in each adaptation post-Election. Mrs Fletcher is no different, with him credited as creator and executive producer, but it’s also in large part to the writers and directors he’s chosen to collaborate with. In this instance, there’s something so cosmically perfect about Perrotta teaming up with the writer-director Nicole Holofcener, the two sharing a great deal in common, both sharp and empathetic in how they capture everyday life without pulling punches. Holofcener has long been one of the greatest yet most underrated talents in Hollywood, from Friends with Money to Enough Said to her Oscar-nominated screenplay for last year’s Can You Ever Forgive Me? For anyone familiar with her or Perrotta’s work, it’s a thrilling match-up. Mrs Fletcher brings out the best of them both, a funny, often daring, and never less than entirely believable series about how to navigate sex in the current moment.As the two are separated, Eve finds unlikely solace online in the world of Milf porn, quickly becoming addicted while college shows Brendan that his aggressively reductive view of women as sexual objects has no place in the real world. A lazier show would treat all of this with a far heavier hand but there’s remarkably light-footed patience, intelligence and a total lack of judgment in Mrs Fletcher and while it might skate close to sitcom-esque scenarios, it never opts for cheap humour. It also manages to address woke culture in way that feels balanced and thoughtful, ridiculing some of the excesses (such as a well-intentioned yet misjudged college lecture on consent) while allowing characters the space to make and then realise the effects of their mistakes (a trans character is asked a crude question in one scene only to be met with a sheepish yet earnest apology a few scenes later).As perfect as Holofcener’s direction might be for Perrotta’s writing, Hahn is equally well-suited to them both. Her finest work has always existed in similar territory, most notably her role as a bored wife befriending a stripper in Jill Soloway’s cruelly underseen 2013 comedy Afternoon Delight. She’s long deserved a show of her own and Mrs Fletcher provides her with a fitting showcase, zipping between funny, sexy, awkward and self-righteous, a wonderful opportunity to see her explore a character for longer than 90 minutes. The show’s pace is gradual, moments are allowed to breathe despite episodes lasting for just 30 minutes and cliffhangers are replaced with opportunities for us to think and discuss, the format never once cheapening Perrotta’s wonderfully naturalistic storytelling.In the three episodes available, Mrs Fletcher promises to become something rather special, an acutely observed show that quietly covers a great deal without ever feeling overstuffed or sententious. And in the subgenre of Tom Perrotta adaptations, the streak remains unbroken.Mrs Fletcher is showing at the Toronto film festival and will begin on HBO in the US on 27 October and in the UK on Sky Atlantic later this year"
American Son review – Kerry Washington can't save Netflix misfire,A well-intentioned adaptation of the Broadway show about race in America suffers from unconvincing characters and risible dialogue,1,"There are important, pertinent ideas in this movie, a Netflix special adapted by Christopher Demos-Brown from his Broadway stage play and directed by Kenny Leon: ideas about racism, sexism and generational conflict. There are good professional actors here doing their well-intentioned best. The dialogue might well have worked well enough in the theatre – well enough to make it a hit, clearly. But on the screen, it’s a deafening misfire, like the most unbearable, unwatchable daytime TV soap filled with the most awful self-conscious hamminess, parodic emoting and pointless shouting-at-each-other acting.The scene is a police station in Miami, in the dead of night. Kerry Washington plays a divorced African American woman, frantic with worry, having reported her 18-year-old son Jamal missing. He has taken the car. Might he have been pulled over somewhere, and fatally lost his teen temper with some nervy trigger-happy cop?A junior officer, played by Jeremy Jordan, is taking her statement with bland bureaucratic condescension, but agreeing to go beyond the rule book to answer her increasingly obstreperous demands for action and information. She is a college professor, yet nonetheless all too grimly accustomed to a million little racist putdowns – this white officer’s attitude feels like more of the same. Is that fair?Maybe, maybe not. Then her ex-husband shows up (Steven Pasquale): white, clean-cut, and an FBI officer to boot, and to her fury, this cop’s attitude is quite different. To him, he is really helpful. The fault lines in this damaged couple’s failed relationship – and perhaps also the fault lines in US society – are painfully tested as the long quarrelsome night drags on. And as it does so, the terrible thought becomes ever stronger: has something serious happened to Jamal?The problem is that these people are not people – they are characters. They do not speak English, they speak dialogue, pages and pages of it, yards and yards of it. It fills their mouths like cardboard. Each scene is like a long drama class. You expect the director to interrupt at any moment and say: “Mm, yeah, OK, let’s try that again, but maybe try … a little less?” There are almost laughable sudden changes of mood and one truly toe-curling “flashback” scene when the unhappy couple remember meeting for the first time as college students – a scene of outrageously sucrose ickiness. The whole movie often feels like a 90-minute SNL sketch with zero laughs.Kerry Washington is a great performer normally, an award-winner recently as Anita Hill in the TV play Confirmation. But this material is not worthy of her.American Son is showing at the Toronto film festival and will be released on Netflix on 1 November"
Greed review – Steve Coogan gleams in knockabout satire of the mega-rich,"Michael Winterbottom’s entertaining mockumentary about a high-street fashion tycoon presents a hideous carnival of obscene wealth, vanity and moral squalor ",3,"That exhilaratingly prolific film-maker Michael Winterbottom – working with additional material from Sean Gray from The Thick of It – has served up a breezy, funny, unsubtle scattershot satire-melodrama all about the moral squalor of the super-rich. They are epitomised by a fictional high-street fashion mogul called Sir Richard “Greedy” McCreadie as he prepares for a monumentally tasteless, Fyre festival-ish, Roman-themed 60th birthday party on the plutocrats’ island of Mykonos. (Rome in Greece? Why not?)McCreadie has just suffered a nightmare of bad publicity following a catastrophic performance in front of a parliamentary select committee, and all the celebs are starting to pull out of his bash. One star who will be there is Clarence, a real, live lion for a re-creation of the Coloseum scene from the movie Gladiator. There’s no need to wonder if that might go horribly, black-comically and symbolically wrong.This is, of course, all a caricature of the Topshop supremo Philip Green. McCreadie is played by Steve Coogan with a tan, an open-necked shirt, alpha-male silver-grey hair and emulsion-white teeth. It is a nice enough performance from Coogan, but this excellent actor is not especially challenged by the shallow, if entertaining, role as it is written, and his technical skill in performance is perhaps best shown most in a tiny moment when he impersonates Bert Lahr as the Cowardly Lion from The Wizard of Oz.Isla Fisher plays Sir Richard’s first wife, in whose name all his tax-avoiding profits were originally registered in Monaco – though whether their divorce meant McCreadie had to take a financial hit isn’t entirely clear. (Philip Green, who has precisely this financial arrangement with his wife Tina, is not divorced.) Shirley Henderson gives an enjoyably robust performance as his elderly Irish mum; Sarah Solemani plays the harassed assistant whose job it is to book Elton John to play at the party; Asa Butterfield is the stroppy teen son with an Oedipal resentment of his dad; and David Mitchell plays a cynical and self-hating journalist-turned-biographer whom Sir Richard has hired to write a sycophantic authorised life.The movie rattles along in mockumentary style, giving us a moment-by-moment display of this hideous carnival of vanity and suppressed despair. But compared to, say, lethally funny TV such as Succession, or indeed Veep, which Gray also worked on, Greed isn’t especially penetrating about money or power. It comes alive most satisfyingly in the flashbacks showing McCreadie as an obnoxious public schoolboy (played by Jamie Blackley), and there is a clever montage imagining all the grisly high-street clothing stores with names like Xcellent that he has set up and put out of business over the years. Scenes in Sri Lanka show how he has brutally exploited developing-world labour - and always with screeching, bullying self-pity, as though they are exploiting him.Winterbottom chucks everything up to and including the kitchen sink into this movie: sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t. Like many films, Greed rather casually brings in the subject of refugees to bolster the drama’s moral and political seriousness: there are some unsightly Syrian refugees on the Mykonos beach that Sir Richard would like removed – but in truth this subject is not very important to the film. There is a fair bit to enjoy here, including some interesting details. Will Elton John really play your party for $1m? Will Tom Jones really do it for $350,000, and will James Blunt play a single song for 75 grand? Is that what he charged for his cameo here? This article was amended on 12 September 2019 to correctly describe Sean Gray’s writing credit on Greed and on 21 February 2020 to correct the date of the UK release.Greed screened at the Toronto film festival and goes on release in the UK on 21 February."
It Chapter Two review –  funhouse theatrics with little emotional punch,"This carnivalesque sequel throws in shocks aplenty and homages to horror classics, but it lacks depth and precision",3,"In the wake of the record-breaking success of 2017’s It (dubbed “horror’s highest-grossing hit”, albeit unadjusted for inflation), this follow-up brings the Stephen King story to an end, not with a whimper but with several spectacular bangs. More epic in both scope and length than its predecessor (the running time outstrips even Tarantino’s ultra-indulgent Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), Andy Muschietti’s good-looking sequel has visual style to spare as it pits its now-adult antiheroes against an ever-expanding creepshow of shrieking scary monsters and crawly super creeps. From giant, drooling clowns to grotesque insect apparitions and spiderlike shape-shifters, It Chapter Two doesn’t skimp on the funhouse theatrics, even riffing on a quotable moment from John Carpenter’s The Thing, which remains a monstrous benchmark for mind-bending 80s horror. Yet in stretching its canvas so far, the film also bursts the balloon-like charm of its predecessor, throwing more at the audience while ultimately landing less of an engaging emotional punch.Twenty-seven years after the Goonies-inflected adventures of the first film, the former members of the Losers’ Club from Derry, Maine (now played by a new, grownup cast), have gone their separate ways, all but forgetting the oath they swore about their ghoulish childhood nemesis: “If it ever comes back, we’ll come back too.” Each has their own life, although the past still haunts them. Bill (James McAvoy) is a popular writer who has a problem with endings; Beverly (Jessica Chastain) has swapped an abusive father for an equally toxic husband; Ben (Jay Ryan) is still lovelorn despite remodelling himself as a ripped success story; Eddie (James Ransone) has retreated into risk assessment; Richie (Bill Hader) has funnelled his insecurities into standup comedy; and Stanley (Andy Bean) lives in terror of his childhood nightmare returning. Only Mike (Isaiah Mustafa) has stayed in Derry, awaiting an echo of former horrors that will call his comrades to “come home, come home”.Things start promisingly with a nostalgic roundup that reunites the old gang in a Chinese restaurant, laying the table for what is to come. An encounter with devilish fortune cookies soon mutates into a shiversome set piece, the palpable chills of which are promptly undercut by a reassuring pay-off gag (“Can we get the check?”). This is a recurrent trope: whenever fear rears its ugly head, humour is swiftly deployed to rebalance the upbeat atmosphere, undercutting any genuine sense of dread. The titular beast may feed on fright, but this movie (like its predecessor) doesn’t really want to scare us beyond delivering the odd jolt. For all its dark secrets (repressed guilt, violent homophobia, post-traumatic amnesia) and visions of sewers full of dead children, the film retains a mainstream popcorn sensibility, as carnivalesque as Derry’s festival fairground.Nods to horror classics abound, from the ripped shower curtain of Psycho to the “Here’s Johnny!” refrain from The Shining, but once again it’s the family-friendly fantasies of Steven Spielberg that cast the longest shadow. From cave-bound Indiana Jones-style action to otherworldly sequences that play out like the third act of Poltergeist (the PG-rated horror on which writer-producer Spielberg cracked the whip), Muschietti draws heavily on the ET director’s back catalogue. When Bill buys back his childhood bike from a grouchy antiquities dealer (one of several cute cameos), you half-expect it to fly.There are some elegantly orchestrated transitions between the young and old incarnations of these characters, although an abundance of flashbacks threatens to overcomplicate an already multistranded narrative. At times, the story becomes so episodic that it starts to feel like a TV miniseries, reminding us of Tommy Lee Wallace’s flawed yet oddly beloved 1990 adaptation. But for all its talk about remembering and forgetting – the interplay between past and present – the film still seems to function largely in the moment, offering fleeting thrills that work in isolation rather than in context. The best of these are eerily understated: a lilting sing-song sentence from the leering Pennywise (Bill Skarsgård, still excellently sinister); a glimpse of an old woman moving in a mysterious way, recalling the scuttling of Mrs Clelia in The Exorcist III or the reverse-spooled staccato stride of Sadako from Ringu.Benjamin Wallfisch’s expansive score amplifies the sense of adventure, while Checco Varese’s widescreen cinematography effectively counterposes bright vistas with dark spaces. It adds up to a peculiar mix of the crowd-pleasing and the patience-testing, veering wildly between the entertaining and the frustrating, built round a story that ventures inexorably underground without ever getting to the heart of what lies beneath."
A Minuscule Adventure review – the bugs are back,"The sequel to the delightful Minuscule: Valley of the Lost Ants, this gorgeous blend of animation and live action reunites a plucky ladybird (now accompanied by his son) with his ant buddies for an adventure that is broader in scope and ambition, but still tiny in size. Although the picture is dialogue-free (the insects communicate in buzzes and clicks), it’s as unmistakably French as the Provençal chestnut puree that provides a key plot device.",4,"The plot has a kinship with Finding Nemo – adventurous youngster finds himself lost far from home; dedicated father sets out to rescue him. In this case, the young ladybird is accidentally sealed in a box of chestnut puree bound for Guadeloupe in the Caribbean. With the help of a friendly ant and a particularly endearing spider with a taste for classical music, his father must try to bring him back home.Like the first film, A Minuscule Adventure is a thing of real beauty. The verdant forests of the French countryside and the lush tropical jungle provide a stunning backdrop for the 3D animated googly-eyed bugs. The sweeping orchestral score is heart-swellingly lovely. And while the creatures are somewhat anthropomorphised (one of them has an iPod mini and a set of speakers), the directors, Hélène Giraud and Thomas Szabo, are careful and respectful of the insect integrity of their tiny cast."
Hustlers review – J-Lo's stealing strippers saga is a vicarious thrill,"The multi-hyphenate star delivers a standout turn in a snappy, fact-based caper about strippers scamming Wall Street bankers ",4,"After the dog days of August, littered with one lazily patchworked Hollywood product after another, there’s something wickedly indulgent about the arrival of Hustlers, a slick, flashy, seductively entertaining segue from one season to the next. It’s ideally positioned, premiering at the Toronto film festival before a mid-September release: it matches the immediate gratification of a summer movie with the artful substantiveness of an awards contender – yet remains not quite definable as either.Based on an acclaimed long-read feature by Jessica Pressler, it tells a story that feels familiar and fresh. Familiar because we’re accustomed to the fact-based crime movie formula, but fresh because we don’t usually see it played out with women. It’s 2007 and Destiny (Constance Wu) has discovered that the life of a stripper isn’t quite as glamorous or as lucrative as she thought. The competition is fierce, the clientele is either creepy (“What did daddy do to you?”) or racist (“Hey, come here Lucy Liu!”) and by the time the men she works for have taken their cut, the money is barely adequate. It doesn’t help that she’s not quite sure what to do or just how to move her body to make more money, something she’s keenly aware of when she meets Ramona (Jennifer Lopez).Ramona is everything Destiny isn’t: she’s in control of her sexuality, her business, and the men she’s trying to impress. She’s also more than happy to take Destiny under her wing to show her some more dextrous moves, and the pair become fast, financially fruitful friends, working the champagne room together, earning more than ever before. But then something happens: the recession. Destiny gets pregnant, leaves the club and years later tries to re-enter the workforce. But her inexperience outside of stripping makes her largely unemployable and so she returns to the place she knows best. Without excessive overspending from Wall Street’s most aggressive earners, it’s a bleaker landscape, and once she’s reunited with Ramona, she learns about fishing.To fish is to leave the four walls of the strip club and bring in guys from outside, to fool them into thinking they’re genuinely interested before drugging them, stealing their account details and racking up exorbitant credit card bills. To Ramona, post-recession, it’s not just a means of survival but a fitting revenge. However, once the pair start earning huge amounts, things soon spiral out of control.There are so many immediate pleasures and vicarious thrills to be had in Hustlers, a giddy, gaudy blast of a movie, that it’s easy to forget the intricate framework which houses it. Through writer-director Lorene Scafaria, whose Susan Sarandon vehicle The Meddler was a warm surprise at Toronto in 2015, a world traditionally seen through leering male eyes is now blessed with a canny, incisive female lens. Even when films have focused on strippers as something other than window dressing, they’ve still been written and directed by men and have smoothed over rougher edges, turning them all into titillating one-note archetypes. Instead, Scafaria views the strip club like any other workplace, filled with internal politics and an ever-changing hierarchy of power. It can be intimidating for sure, but there’s also a genuine camaraderie between a group of women who realise that combining their talents makes them that much more powerful.When the women are having fun, so are we, and for the most part, there’s plenty of it to be had, whether it’s watching a cameoing Cardi B teach Wu how to lap dance or Lopez trying to pay for a luxury car with dollar bills. Scafaria smoothly guides us through their world on the way up, but has a rougher time on the way down – an inevitable pitfall of the subgenre. Often the mechanics of true crime tales aren’t quite cinematic enough and as the plan falls apart, Scafaria’s film almost follows. The rhythm becomes fractured and there’s an overreliance on our investment in certain emotional angles. But it’s a brief dip. As the final act looms, the film gets back on track in time to wrestle with the knotty issue of morality. Was it acceptable for the women to steal this money because it was arguably stolen in the first place? Did society owe them something that they were merely taking from elsewhere? What chances did these men have that these women didn’t?Wu, who broke out with what I found to be a rather flat and charmless turn in Crazy Rich Asians, is far more effective here, slickly switching between vulnerable and manipulative and while there are equally effective performances from Riverdale’s Lili Reinhart and Akeelah and the Bee’s Keke Palmer, the film really, truly belongs to J-Lo. Blessed with one of the most memorable entrances in recent cinema history (pole-dancing to Fiona Apple’s Criminal and met with a swarm of money), Lopez slinks through Hustlers with a deceptive ease, as in control of the film as her character is of her situation. It’s the sort of role that only a true movie star could pull off, so much of it reliant on a rare, intoxicating magnetism. It’s all too easy to view her acting career as starting and ending with Out of Sight and she has coasted in some frustratingly mediocre films since, but she’s always remained a captivating screen presence. She’s so perfectly calibrated as Ramona that it feels like she’s been unintentionally building toward it for years. Awards attention would be deserved but a far greater result would be a more expansive set of roles in her future.She’s the shining neon star of Hustlers, a shrewd, deliciously entertaining pop culture caper that kicks off the new season with a splash. Bring some dollar bills, because they deserve them.Hustlers is showing at the Toronto film festival and will be released on 13 September"
Knives Out review – Rian Johnson crafts a devious meta whodunnit,The Last Jedi director lets loose with a wickedly entertaining Agatha Christie homage featuring a star-packed cast ,4,"Taking a brief well-earned break from the creative restrictions of the Star Wars universe, Rian Johnson has treated us to a wonderfully devious Agatha Christie homage, a freeing exercise that shows just how much he can achieve without Lucasfilm breathing down his neck. The Last Jedi director (and soon to be creator of an all-new Star Wars trilogy) is a self-confessed fan of the mystery author and has managed to concoct a contemporary whodunnit that both respects and revises the subgenre. In other words, with Knives Out, he’s killed it.The setup is one we all know: the gothic house in the middle of the countryside, the rich family with a pile of bitter grudges and, most importantly, the dead patriarch with a fortune to leave behind. But Johnson knows that we know this all too well and knows we know he knows this too so knows he has to work that much harder to outfox us by knowing more than we think we might know. His film is a delicious challenge to well-trained armchair detectives and there’s a dizzying joy in watching him and his cast play with the rules, leaving us in the dark to figure out where it’s all going. It’s unexpected in ways that it would be cruel for me to spoil so I’ll keep things intentionally vague.The body is that of Harlan Thrombrey (Christopher Plummer), a wildly successful mystery writer whose 85th birthday party proves to be his last. His throat has been slashed in what authorities are deeming a suicide because as a murder it would be an impossible crime. The evidence doesn’t support the idea of foul play but private detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) has been hired by an unknown figure to investigate this very possibility. He conducts a string of interviews with the dysfunctional Thrombrey clan to figure out who might have a motive but quickly discovers it would be easier to figure out who doesn’t.As is standard with the Christie adaptations that inspired him, Knives Out is stacked with stars but rather than aiming for the biggest names, regardless of fit, Johnson has opted for recognisable yet incisive casting, each actor perfectly matched to their role. There’s Jamie Lee Curtis as the vaingloriously “self-made” daughter with a penchant for a vicious one-liner, Don Johnson as her doltish husband, Chris Evans as her spoilt son, Michael Shannon as her bookish brother and Toni Collette as her Instafamous sister-in-law. Johnson also finds room for Blade Runner 2049’s Ana de Armas as Harlan’s loyal nurse, It’s Jaeden Martell as a Trump-supporting grandson, 13 Reason Why’s Katherine Langford as a Trump-loathing granddaughter and Lakeith Stanfield as the cop working with Craig to figure all of this out. Everyone in the cast is having a ball and it’s especially fun to see actors such as Lee Curtis, Craig, Collette and Evans show off their comic prowess, given their mostly dramatic roles of late. There’s also striking work from rising star de Armas who isn’t allowed quite the same amount of fun as her flashier co-stars but leaves a lasting impression nonetheless.Working from his own original script, Johnson has much fun pulling the strings as well as the rug from underneath us time and time again. There are reveals that tip the standard structure on its head in ways that prove wickedly disorienting and while there’s meta commentary, he avoids smugness. It’s not the empty, slavish homage it could have been as Johnson knows that simply regurgitating the rules with a wink wouldn’t be enough. There’s genuinely thrilling ingenuity here and while some of his attempts to give the film a contemporary, Trump’s America spin are a little too clunky, other similar touches work so well that you’re willing to forget them.It’s such a rare pleasure to see a director so in love with a genre without slipping into Tarantinoesque fanboy indulgence, remembering his audience is bigger than himself and also that his film requires both head and heart. He’s next set to return to a galaxy far far away but after watching Knives Out, I wish he’d stay with us for a bit longer.Knives Out is showing at the Toronto film festival and will be released in the US on 27 November and in the UK on 29 November"
Sprinter review – speedy sporting drama runs out of puff,A Jamaican athlete’s career is jeopardised by problems off the track in this heartwarming tale of ambition and family ties,3,"Here’s a heartfelt sports drama from Jamaica made in the traditional style, about a teenage athlete who dreams of using his blistering talent to give his family a better life. Does the kid have sufficient grit to make it to the finish line?Sprinter is a movie that leaves virtually no sporting cliche unbothered, yet it’s rooted in a naturalistic, emotional family drama reflecting the specific pleasures and perils of life in Jamaica. Storm Saulter directs with energy and style, with Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith as executive producers.Dale Elliott plays Akeem, an exceptional 200-metre sprinter. A warm, easygoing kid, he’s nicknamed the Rasta Rocket and is already a national hero. But family problems are distracting him. Akeem’s mum (Lorraine Toussaint from Orange Is the New Black) has been working illegally in the US for a decade. His dad (Dennis Titus) is lonely, worn out from raising two sons alone, and drinking heavily. Akeem’s older brother Germaine (Kadeem Wilson) is living proof of the dangers of trusting in sport as a ticket out. Once a hot favourite 400-metre runner, Germaine picked up an injury. Now he’s working for a local gangster.For a film about an athlete, Sprinter dawdles to a finish, as Akeem struggles with concentration ahead of a make-or-break race. Still, it’s impossible not to root for this movie. Newcomer Elliott is such an open presence, and the stakes for Akeem, and other explosively talented kids like him, are so high.Jamaica has been unveiled as a major location in the new Bond film, but let’s have more films about Jamaican people living their lives, please. Sprinter is released in the UK on 6 September."
The Run review – ultra-marathon documentary trips up,"A film charting Pat Farmer’s 4,600km dash across India piles on the platitudes, reducing an amazing odyssey to nippy travelogue",2,"The Indian ascetic tradition can add another name to its ranks: former Australian parliamentary secretary and ultra-marathon runner Pat Farmer, whose 4,600km “Spirit of India” run in 2016 from the subcontinent’s southern tip to Kashmir is chronicled here. That’s 80km – two marathons – a day, for 64 days. If that, often undertaken in 80% humidity, doesn’t sound masochistic enough, Farmer’s social schedule (the run is to promote girls’ education) would finish any normal man off: he attends more than 750 “events”, many on the hoof, during this time.India can’t fail to provide colour en route, but director Anupam Sharma’s nippy travelogue format is strictly passing through. Barely any Indians are interviewed about what Farmer’s feat means to them, and the alternating asphalt-pounding and meet-and-greets eventually stretch the bounds of documentary patience. Farmer himself is so indomitable – even a bout of stomach flu barely causes him to break stride – that he isn’t that compelling a subject.The closest The Run comes to an arresting subplot is with the team’s greenhorn intern Kevin, fresh out of university, who finds himself under Farmer’s cosh for failing to secure decent enough media coverage. At one point, he muses that the Aussie press would find the story more compelling if his boss died. Watching him shuffle his battered sinews across four lanes of Mumbai traffic, this seems a distinct possibility.An unfulfilled note hangs over the whole enterprise. A meeting with Modi doesn’t come through. The postscript resentfully notes that Farmer has yet to be invited to participate in bilateral trade discussions. Kevin’s insight lingers: you have to ask if Farmer found a sharp enough way to communicate the meaning of this journey. Not in this film, which doesn’t go beyond platitudes about “dreams” and “bringing the two countries closer together”, or pry much into Farmer’s seemingly bottomless obstinacy. The Spirit of India isn’t even the most hardcore thing he’s done – that would be the Pole to Pole run in 2011. Still, saying it merits A for effort feels like an understatement. The Run is released in the UK on 6 September."
The Big Meeting review – heartfelt tribute to miners' solidarity,Daniel Draper shows that even after the pits have closed a defiant spirit lives on in the inspiring Durham Miners’ gala,4,"Daniel Draper is the film-maker who in 2017 made The Nature of the Beast, an affectionate tribute to Labour MP Dennis Skinner, and now he has directed this rich, heartfelt and intimate tribute to the Durham Miners’ gala, the trade union festival of brass band music, speeches and outdoor conviviality which has been held almost annually since 1871. It is a proud expression of working-class solidarity that has now been restored to the centre of Labour party culture with the rise of Jeremy Corbyn, who is a keen gala attender.Draper’s film persuasively shows that even after the pits have closed, a defiant and exuberant spirit importantly lives on in the gala. The merry-making and the music may once have been purely the icing on the cake of trade union business, but now increasingly it is the cake, it is the business. The cultural superstructure has now become the essential expression of determination to stand firm against the perennial threat of exploitation.Now that the pure arrogance and recklessness of the Conservatives has been revealed, a vigorous alternative culture of the left – symbolised by the gala – is needed more than ever. The point of the gala is to celebrate extra-parliamentary traditions of social justice, though, as it happens, right now the point for the progressive left is surely to defend parliament against the riverboat gamblers and sociopath wreckers of the Brexiter right.My favourite part of this documentary is the eloquent contribution from art historian Robert McManners, who gives a fascinating account of miners’ art that emerged from the north-east, collected in the book Shafts of Light. I’ve ordered my copy. The Big Meeting is released in the UK on 6 September."
Moffie review – soldiers on the frontline of homophobia,Hidden passions add to the brutish hell of apartheid-era South African conscripts in Oliver Hermanus’s skilfully tense drama,4,"Moffie, screening in the Orizzonti sidebar at Venice, is a tense, stealthy rites-of-passage drama from the dog days of South Africa’s apartheid regime, a tale of callow young conscripts inside a corroded old system. Set in 1981 during the country’s border conflict with communist-backed Angola, Oliver Hermanus’s film manages an unflinching portrait of a society in spasm; paranoid and brutish and largely screaming at itself. It’s a war story of sorts in which the battle has already been lost.Kai Luke Brummer gives a fine performance as Nicholas, a willowy 18-year-old at a sun-blasted army boot-camp. Nick and his fellow soldiers are supposed to be fighting the enemy, but the only action they’re seeing is on the volleyball court, or the dorm, or sometimes in the toilet cubicle, much to the sergeant’s horror. The way the officers see it, the very worst thing a soldier can be is a “moffie”, an Afrikaans insult that the subtitles translate as “faggot”. “Moffie!” they scream – as though they regard homosexuality as a mad dog that has somehow got under the fence, or an invading swarm of wasps, liable to sting any man who isn’t properly covered up.Nick has a porn mag, which surely means he’s protected. But he’s also drawn to handsome, sophisticated Staffen (Ryan de Villiers), who helps him dig a trench. But men have orders to remain in the pit until dawn. It’s cold and it’s wet. They’re only snuggling up to keep warm.Hermanus, a black South African film-maker, has said that he initially balked at the prospect of making a film about the plight of his nation’s white minority. But he was swayed by the power of Andre-Carl van der Murwe’s memoir (Moffie’s source material) and by an unexpected sense of kinship with the desperate duo at its centre. Without ever glossing over South Africa’s culture of institutionalised racism, Hermanus suggests that its rampant homophobia is creating its share of casualties too.Staffen, for starters, will not be tolerated. “He’s a piece of shit,” says the sergeant; he’s contaminating the barracks. But after the boy is shipped off for re-education, Nicholas is left turning in circles, exposed beneath the big bruised skies, only dimly aware that he is about to be deployed. Meanwhile Moffie maintains its own holding pattern, ratcheting up the tension and wringing optimum menace from the conscripts’ simmering levels of boredom as Braam du Toit’s superb atonal soundtrack hints at mounting psychological unease. Hermanus favours handheld cameras, brought in so close to the actors that every sudden movement, however mundane, carries the threat of violence and you’re never entirely sure whether somebody is about to be punched or kissed – nor which outcome would be the more disastrous.Moffie is measured, remorseless; it crawls right under your skin. By the time these virgin soldiers are removed from the barracks, sent into the rushes where the enemy lies in wait, it almost comes as a sweet relief."
The Souvenir – Joanna Hogg’s most intimate film to date,Tom Burke and Honor Swinton Byrne star in this tender tale of a relationship built on deceit,4,"Joanna Hogg has never been afraid of the dark – the vast empty spaces that exist between people in apparently intimate relationships. In Archipelago she painted a portrait of a family as fractured as the scattered land masses of Scilly; lonely islands separated by treacherous choppy waters. In Exhibition she put a fractious couple in an up-for-sale London townhouse that seemed specifically designed to keep them apart; the architecture of isolation.The Souvenir, on which Martin Scorsese served as an executive producer, continues Hogg’s unflinching examination of personal distance, focusing on a couple who seem to live in an atmosphere of silent deceit and highly choreographed concealment.Yet this autobiographically inspired drama is also her most intimate film to date, boasting scenes that play like pages torn from an experiential diary.While previous works may have taken a scalpel to characters and situations with which the film-maker is clearly familiar, here Hogg turns the blade on herself, performing what seems at times to be a delicate act of on-screen auto-vivisection. It’s powerful stuff: wryly tender, frequently funny, but insidiously suffocating. More than once I found myself stifling a scream – and I mean that as a compliment.Like the subject matter, Hogg keeps the casting close to home, enlisting her goddaughter Honor Swinton Byrne to play 1980s film student Julie. While struggling to find her own directorial voice, Julie falls into the orbit of Anthony (Tom Burke), a chain-smoking roué with an air of insouciant arrogance; a “to-the-manner-born” attitude that repels and seduces simultaneously. Anthony claims to work for the Foreign Office, although a question mark hangs over everything he says.At first, Anthony acts as a mentor to Julie, their exchanges possessing an off-kilter, businesslike quality, as if some shady deal is being done that no one fully understands. Even when they become “a couple”, they continue to conduct their affairs in an unsettling, disconnected fashion, fetishised through the rituals of expensive lunches, tangential conversations and weirdly weaponised gifts of clothing.It’s no surprise that Anthony has secrets, or that these secrets should prove increasingly poisonous. Even his oldest friends seem to find him potentially malignant, and wonder what Julie is doing with him (“I’m trying to work out how you two… tesselate,” says Patrick, played in a razor-sharp cameo by Richard Ayoade). “You’re lost,” Anthony tells Julie, “and you’ll always be lost.”It’s a quietly cruel assessment, an echo of the ambiguity of the Fragonard painting (whose subject may be either “sad” or “determined”) from which the film takes its title, and which hangs over the unfolding relationship like the sword of Damocles. There’s a sense of watching a car crash in slow motion, the after-effects of which will apparently be explored in The Souvenir: Part II, which has already been shot.As with all of Hogg’s work, it’s what people don’t say that matters. Watching the film for a second time, I kept thinking of the words of the penitential prayer that asks forgiveness for “what we have done”, and (more damningly) “what we have left undone”, as if the spectres of both guilt and salvation lie in the space between actions. That sense of absence is heightened by Helle le Fevre’s editing, which adds sharp edges to David Raedeker’s glowing 16mm cinematography, and encourages us to fill in the gaps as we peer through the cracks of this mysterious love story.Particular plaudits are due to Tom Burke, who gives a career-best performance that is brilliantly enigmatic, a mesmerising blend of predation and vulnerability. While Burke’s Anthony seems practised in the art of deception, Swinton Byrne’s Julie is all hesitancy and uncertainty, a quality nurtured by Hogg’s use of improvisation to keep her central character guessing. As Julie’s mother, Rosalind, Tilda Swinton has the air of one about to crack, like a slightly chipped porcelain cup. Hogg’s work with actors has always been exceptional, but here she is at the top of her game, making each role count by maintaining that balance of closeness and separation that is her trademark."
Aniara review – stunning sci-fi eco parable,This Swedish drama set on a spaceship heading to Mars sees AI facilitating our worst excesses,4,"Most predictions about the future of artificial intelligence suggest two possibilities: AI will either make us immortal or it will hasten our extinction. Aniara posits a third option: the unredeemable awfulness of humanity drives an artificial intelligence to suicide. From the country that gave us Greta Thunberg comes a staggering sci-fi eco parable set on a transport ship from a scorched Earth to a dormitory settlement on Mars. Aniara (the name comes from an ancient Greek word meaning “despairing”) is based on a 1956 epic poem from the Swedish Nobel laureate Harry Martinson and explores the end of humanity in capsule form. And when we go, according to this wildly ambitious debut feature from writing and directing team Pella Kågerman and Hugo Lilja, it will be not with a bang but with a mindless plod of consumerism, a flailing grasp for meaning and the occasional space orgy.One of many massive ships used to ferry the remains of the human race (or at least those lucky enough to buy a chance of a new life) from Earth to Mars, the Aniara is essentially a galactic shopping mall. It’s like the ship from WALL-E viewed through the prism of Tarkovsky’s Solaris.On board is a virtual-reality AI therapy room called the Mima, run by MR (Emelie Jonsson). At first the passengers prefer to trawl around the endless retail options. But when a freak collision with some space junk sends the ship off course, the passengers turn to the Mima, which becomes a valuable resource. And like all of Earth’s resources, it’s plundered. A haunting allegorical tale, Aniara warns of humanity hurtling in the wrong direction and realising too late that there is no turning back."
Judy review – Renée Zellweger goes full rainbow in vanilla biopic,"Zellweger rises to the challenge superbly in a standard-issue heartwarmer, premiering in Telluride, that sugarcoats the sadness",3,"For Judy Garland fans, the final station of the cross in the ordeal of her last years was a five-week booking at the Talk of the Town nightclub in London in 1969, which she desperately needed for the money. In those famous and often chaotic concerts she appeared frail, unwell, tipsy or bleary-eyed: mannerisms that she had long since semi-consciously incorporated into her live act. But they were real at some level. Also real were the many flashes of the old magic; emotional arias made more glorious for having been wrenched from her battered heart. This movie is about that troubled period: a defiant last stand in full view of her passionately supportive fans. It was Judy’s emotional Alamo in the face of parasitic husbands, spiteful press and misogynist showbiz overlords – beginning with studio chief Louis B Mayer, who ruined her childhood on the yellow brick road to stardom.Judy is adapted by screenwriter Tom Edge from Peter Quilter’s stage play End of the Rainbow, and is directed by Rupert Goold; Renée Zellweger gives us a heartfelt, studied portrayal of Garland. Her performance and the film itself are forthright and un-camp, though careful to acknowledge the importance of Garland’s gay fanbase by adroitly creating two fictional gay superfans. It is clearly influenced by Garland’s own self-mythologising movie about her British period, I Could Go on Singing (1963), about the gutsy yet vulnerable singing star doing shows at the London Palladium.But this is really a standard-issue biopic heartwarmer about a Hollywood star in decline and in Blighty: a bit like the recent Stan & Ollie, about Laurel and Hardy’s final British tours. We get the usual sobering biographical grace notes over the final credits, although not the traditional black-and-white photos of the real-life people, perhaps because Judy Garland is just too well known. The film sugarcoats Garland’s physical deterioration, her addictions, her wretchedness and her mortality. However, paradoxically, it’s the most relaxed and personal performance we have seen from Zellweger in a while.She plays a resilient Judy who has taken all that life has to throw at her and (to borrow a line used in the recent Elton John film Rocketman) she is still … well, sometimes she’s not standing, sometimes she’s actually falling over on stage. But she’s still battling on many fronts, mostly financial, living in California, divorced from her third husband, Sid Luft (Rufus Sewell), and in an acrimonious dispute with him about the children. There’s no money coming in and when the London residency is mooted, she jumps at the chance of solid earnings and a restorative blast of adoration from British admirers. But there’s no chance of taking the children with her, and so she manages loneliness with booze and pills (the film doesn’t do justice to the scale of her drug dependency). She is uneasy with her Brit promoter Bernard Delfont (Michael Gambon), but has support from exasperated assistant Rosalyn Wilder (Jessie Buckley). So the London gigs commence, interspersed with flashbacks to her unhappy childhood on the Oz set, with Darci Shaw as the young Judy. In the present day, there’s a new chance of romance with a handsome cocktail waiter called Mickey Deans (Finn Wittrock). You don’t have to be a Garlandologist to figure out if that is going to end well.Zellweger rises resolutely to the challenge of playing Judy on stage and off: her eyes crinkle in tandem with a tremulous pout when her feelings are hurt, and sometimes when they are the opposite of hurt, although she is perhaps less convincing with the wide-eyed Garland gaze. Her walk and stance cleverly convey the sense of someone who is only in her 40s but feels older, but is rejuvenated by the electric thrill of being on stage. Yet the movie missed a trick in the way it depicted the difficult relationship with her daughter Liza Minnelli (played here by Gemma-Leah Devereux): there is one low-key meeting between them at a party in which Judy undermines Liza’s confidence, but it is underpowered. Liza herself deserves almost as much mythologising and turbocharged drama as Judy, and a mother-daughter encounter between these icons should really be a showstopper.There was only ever really one way and one tune to end this film, and it duly arrives along with an interesting and realistic touch about the necessity of not expecting miracles. Zellweger gives us a tribute to Judy Garland’s flair and to that ethos of the show needing to go on being both a burden and driving force. Yet Garland’s terrible sadness is mostly invisible."
Seberg review: Kristen Stewart meets the Black Panthers in low-key biopic,"Until its taut closing stages, Benedict Andrews’ film does scant justice to the story of Breathless star Jean Seberg’s persecution by the FBI",2,"“New York Herald Tribune,” cried 21-year-old Jean Seberg as she marched down the Champs-Élysées. She was an American in Paris: the imported poster girl of Jean-Luc Godard’s revolutionary Breathless. Few actors embodied the footloose buoyancy of the New Wave like Seberg, an airy midwesterner with a political edge. And few would have guessed that she was heading for the rocks.No doubt there’s a brilliant tragic drama to be made about the life of Seberg, who spoke out for civil rights, supported the Black Panthers and was duly dragged through the mud by J Edgar Hoover’s FBI. But it emphatically isn’t Benedict Andrews’ bantamweight biopic, a tale of shadowy US history that feels machine-tooled and suspect and is shot with the hyper-real lighting one normally finds in a photographer’s studio or shopping mall. It tells us that Seberg was wronged and that she looked really great in a bra – and not necessarily in that order.Kristen Stewart stars as the actor-at-a-crossroads, tottering around late-60s LA with her blouse unbuttoned and her chequebook hanging open. She’s heartily sick of being America’s sweetheart and wants to use whatever leverage she has to fight the power and support the cause. Her new lover, Hakim Jamal (Anthony Mackie), introduces her to the Panthers. Her stick-in-the-mud agent almost drops dead on the spot.Stewart’s a fabulous actor, as demonstrated in Personal Shopper, Certain Women, any number of others, and she sets about this role with a grim determination that’s admirable in and of itself. What lets her down is the by-numbers plotting, together with the sort of flat, declamatory dialogue that might have been lifted from a teen-magazine photo story. She says, “I want to make a difference” and “I’ve been running from that girl my whole life.” She says, “I’m funding the Panthers”, just to be absolutely sure that we’re all up to speed.The FBI certainly knows the score. It loathes Seberg and all that she stands for and not even Jack O’Connell’s conscience-stricken G-man can step in to prevent the demolition job they have planned. And here, in its closing stages, the film finally becomes the serious, sombre picture it probably should have been all along, as the actor falls to pieces and starts tearing her apartment apart in search of bugs, like Harry Caul at the end of The Conversation. The battle is over and the dream is in tatters. The tale can move with the freedom of a film that has nothing left to lose."
Angel Has Fallen review – on the run from the Russians,Gerard Butler’s Secret Service agent is framed by Moscow in the tasteless third film in the franchise,2,"In 2013’s Olympus Has Fallen, North Korea was America’s enemy; its Islamophobic 2016 follow-up, London Has Fallen, took umbrage with Muslim terrorists via Pakistan. This time, the tasteless franchise targets Russia. Or rather, it is targeted by Russia, who have framed Gerard Butler’s Secret Service agent Mike Banning for an assassination attempt on President Trumbull (Morgan Freeman, pleasingly presidential). On a fishing trip with Trumball, a swarm of drones equipped with facial recognition software wipes out all of the agents bar Banning. And when the FBI discover $10m in an offshore account under his name, he’s forced to go on the run.The film imagines Banning and his wife, Leah (Piper Perabo), as victims, which is to say that the American values they represent – valour, honesty, traditional gender roles and national pride – are portrayed as under threat. Butler is convincingly sturdy as Banning, but the film’s politics are shaky. Banning’s estranged father, Clay (Nick Nolte), is a damaged Vietnam veteran who teaches his son about the futility of war before setting off a wall of home-rigged explosions. There is something odd about the way the film condemns bloodshed while revelling in trigger-happy violence."
Crawl review – slight B-movie horror,A father and daughter trapped with alligators in a hurricane proves a shallow experience,2,"A category 5 hurricane is brewing and daddy Dave (Barry Pepper) isn’t picking up his phone. En route to her childhood home to retrieve him before it hits, University of Florida swimmer Haley Keller (British actor Kaya Scodelario) drives past an alligator farm; a foreshadowing of trouble in Alexandre Aja’s slender disaster horror.Aja smartly limits most of the action to the family’s dank, fast-flooding basement – a “crawlspace”, if you will – where Dave is trapped. A congregation of killer gators have made their way in through a drain pipe and are keeping him company. If they are CGI, they don’t look it. Each opportunity for rescue is swiftly scuppered but, as former swimming coach Dave tells his daughter, their escape is mind over matter (“I keep telling you, it’s not your body that’s stopping you”).The scenes of family bonding are tiresome but the action is mostly tense and cheerfully bloody. French film-maker Aja directed remakes of The Hills Have Eyes (2006) and Piranha (2010); clearly, he has an appreciation for trashy B-movies. Crawl benefits from its economical 87-minute runtime, but as a genre piece it’s perhaps more skin than muscle."
Pain and Glory – bittersweet perfection from Pedro Almodóvar,Antonio Banderas gives the performance of his career as a fictional stand-in for the Spanish director in a drama that blurs the line between art and life,4,"In Pedro Almodóvar’s previous film Julieta, a middle-aged woman returns to her old apartment block in Madrid to write about – and thereby confront – the ghosts of her life. There’s a similar sense of revisiting in Pain and Glory, in which Antonio Banderas plays a becalmed film-maker, struggling to move forward, borne back ceaselessly into the past. Described as the third part of an “unplanned trilogy” which began with Law of Desire (1987) and continued through Bad Education (2004), it’s another deeply personal work from Almodóvar that mixes autobiography with fiction to powerful effect. As the title suggests, the result is a tragicomic swirl of heartbreak and joy, slipping dexterously between riotous laughter and piercing sadness. At its heart is Banderas giving the performance of a lifetime in a role that, following his Cannes triumph, surely demands Oscar recognition.Like Marcello Mastroianni in Fellini’s 8½, Banderas’s Salvador Mallo is an autofictional director in crisis. His mother, Jacinta, died four years ago and he had a back operation two years ago; he has not recovered from either trauma. Racked by pain, both physical and metaphysical (neatly illustrated by Juan Gatti’s Saul Bass-inflected graphics), Salvador has given up on work and retreated into a depressive cycle, reliant on medication. For more than three decades he’s been estranged from actor Alberto (Asier Etxeandia, excellent), the lead in his 1980s film Sabor, with whom he had a famously fractious relationship. Now a festival wants them to reunite and introduce a restored revival of the picture.Alberto is a habitual heroin user who introduces Salvador to chasing the dragon before chancing upon his private manuscript, Addiction, a reminiscence of a love affair torn apart. “It’s a confessional text,” says Salvador. “I don’t want to be identified”, echoing his mother’s complaints that his films had turned their private lives into public entertainment. But Alberto insists on performing Addiction as a monologue, setting in motion a chain of events that will blur the line between art and life.As the present-day story creeps woozily forward, so a mosaic of vivid flashbacks transports Salvador to an altogether more vibrant past: the childhood that saw his parents moving to a village in Valencia where they lived in “a cave!”; the thunderbolt-like dawn of desire, experienced as a childhood fainting fit, understood only on reflection, from a distance; the thrill and agony of unforgettable love, forged in 80s Madrid, the city that would become (in bullfighting parlance) “a difficult ring”.It’s significant that we first meet Salvador underwater, submerged in a swimming pool, his thoughts floating toward a vision of his mother (played in her younger years by Penélope Cruz) washing clothes in the river – a pastoral idyll. When Salvador recalls his discovery of cinema as a gushing font of life, it’s buoyant images of lakes and waterfalls that leap to mind, forever entwined with the smell of “piss, jasmine and a summer breeze”. Music is a time machine too, from the communal singing of Jacinta and her friends, through the piano tune that takes Salvador back to his seminary choir days (“I like the Beatles and cinema!” he burbles, before being directed toward “less pagan subjects”).For all the darkness in Salvador’s life, Pain and Glory surrounds him with the blocks of highly choreographed colour that have become Almodóvar’s trademark, accentuating his sense of greying isolation. When estranged lovers meet, Almodóvar stages their embrace as a kaleidoscopic tango of red and blue intertwined, signifying internal fervour amid a scene of dramatic restraint.Never before has Banderas seemed so vulnerable, his eyes darting back and forth in fear and wonder, shining through a mask of deadpan melancholia and regret. Like the usually burly Russell Crowe’s portrayal of Jeffrey Wigand in The Insider, Banderas here seems to shrink and grow simultaneously, perfectly capturing both the strengths and weaknesses of his character.In the supporting roles, special mention is due to Julieta Serrano as Jacinta in her 80s, a flintier rendering of previous maternal figures (Almodóvar’s films are, arguably, all about his mother) who tells Salvador offhandedly that he was never a good son, a moment of pin-sharp, bittersweet perfection. Alberto Iglesias’s lovely score perfectly matches the shifting tones of the drama: the warmth of the early childhood scenes, the poignancy of Jacinta’s last days, the tensions and anxieties of Salvador’s suspended life.It all adds up to a richly satisfying work from a film-maker whose love of cinema, in all its pain and glory, shines through every frame."
Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark review – can’t decide who to frighten,This adaptation of Alvin Schwartz’s book of shocking short tales overdoes the gruesomeness,3,"Producer and co-writer Guillermo del Toro brings Alvin Schwartz’s much-loved children’s book series to the big screen, but this uneven film can’t decide who it’s trying to scare. Schwartz’s anthology of self-contained spooky short stories was popular in the 1980s, drawing on folklore and urban myths; here, the stories are stitched together as a collection of creepy prophecies.In the fictional town of Mill Valley, Pennsylvania, a gaggle of nerdy teens led by aspiring writer Stella (Zoe Colletti) break into a dilapidated mansion. Local legend has it that the Bellows family kept their daughter Sarah locked up; in an act of vengeance, she’d tell scary stories to children through the wall. When Stella steals Sarah’s book of stories, her aggrieved spirit is reanimated.In a departure from the books, the film adopts a period setting, taking place in the weeks leading up to Nixon’s election in 1968. The spectre of the Vietnam war hangs over the grisly proceedings, adding interesting atmospheric texture but little narrative detail. The film’s teen protagonists, meanwhile, are chaste children’s book heroes, but the horror, based on illustrator Stephen Gammell’s drawings, has a gruesome quality that feels too full-on for youngsters. A red pimple is infested with spiders, a human toe floats to the top of a vomit-like stew, and a lumpy, pale woman who smiles and shuffles ominously down a hospital corridor is truly terrifying."
UglyDolls review – fluffy toys deliver a fuzzy message,Cuddly cast-offs must overcome an evil mayor in an animated tale that urges us to cherish our imperfections – or does it?,2,"The good news of the summer was that Toy Story 4 didn’t suck. The bad news is the arrival of this sugary manic kids’ animation whose sole reason for existence seems to be hardselling the UglyDolls brand of cuddly toys. The film-makers have pilfered Toy Story’s emotional core, the need of toys to belong – what is a toy without a kid to cuddle it? – and spooned on the treacle. The spin here is that the UglyDolls are toy factory rejects, living with the dreadful void of never having known the warm touch of a toddler or the feel of wet snot on the fur. The songs are horrifically soppy.Kelly Clarkson voices relentlessly cheerful Moxxy, a fuzzy pink doll with a missing front tooth who lives in the town of Uglyville. Moxxy wakes up every morning believing that today is the day she’ll finally be picked to live with a child. The dark truth is that all the cuddlies in Uglyville have been spat out of a chute at the toy factory and on to the scrap heap. One day Moxxy travels up the chute and the story shifts to the Institute of Perfection, the final testing stage for dolls, where the mayor is evil doll kid Lou (Nick Jonas), a plasticky cross between Justin Bieber and Draco Malfoy.Veteran Kelly Asbury (Gnomeo & Juliet, Shrek 2) directs with brisk professionalism but the script is fussily and unimaginatively plotted. I had a problem too with the film’s message. The point ostensibly being made is that it’s your imperfections that make you special – let your freak flag fly! Ugly is cool! But the film is constantly defining what ugly is: freckles, crooked teeth, excess weight, glasses, clumsiness. At times it feels like an unintentional crib sheet for under-sevens bullying.UglyDolls is released in the UK on 16 August."
Dora and the Lost City of Gold review – live-action romp for the teen explorer,Isabela Moner brings the animated character to exuberant life as she heads into the jungle to find her missing mom and pop,3,"Paramount’s long-planned live-action Dora the Explorer movie proves an appreciably peppy entertainment. James Bobin and Nicholas Stoller, the writer/director pairing behind The Muppets (2011), reframe the wide-eyed, song-prone heroine of Nickelodeon’s educative teatime treat much as Enchanted (2007) did decades of Disney princesses, pitching a picture-book avatar into something like reality. At first we’re encouraged to laugh at an in-every-sense curious figure, then nudged towards an acknowledgement that this open-minded, forward-looking Latin Pollyanna might still teach civilisation a thing or two. It’s the only family film on release to broach the issue of how to escape quicksand intact.The first act is slightly more subversive than what follows. When her parents (Michael Peña and Eva Longoria) set off in search of Eldorado, the now teenage Dora (Instant Family’s Isabela Moner) is dispatched to relatives in LA, where she creates havoc at school security with her well-stuffed backpack and calls out Moby-Dick for cultural appropriation. Thereafter, the film settles into a conventional matinee arc, with the players returned to colourful jungle landscapes, as per Sony’s Jumanji reboot, in search of the suddenly missing mom and pop.Family integrity is the real treasure, though even here there’s the odd, distinctive flourish: youngsters amused by the song about digging a poo hole will be beside themselves at the psychotropic flowers that momentarily convert the action back into animation.The knowing tone again feels like Hollywood confessing to trading in material few could take seriously, yet a certain sincerity is evident in Moner’s winning performance, and in the most conscientious, cine-literate Latin-American hiring policy this side of Robert Rodriguez’s Spy Kids films, encompassing both Peckinpah survivor Isela Vega and Danny Trejo as the voice of a wise monkey.Comedian Eugenio Derbez sports a treacherous beard worthy of the great 80s character actor William Atherton; Peña and Longoria have giggly, conspiratorial fun in dispatches. No one is enjoying themselves more, though, than production designer Dan Hennah (Thor: Ragnarok), who gets to recreate Raiders of the Lost Ark on a modern studio budget, at every turn conjuring up sets that even the adults in the audience might want to run around on. Dora and the Lost City of Gold is released in the UK on 16 August and in Australia on 19 September."
American Factory review – a sobering documentary by the Obamas,This first film in their post-White House careers is an absorbing study of the culture clash in a Chinese-run Ohio car plant,4,"‘There is no magic wand to bring back jobs,” said US president Barack Obama in 2016. Now he has returned to this sombre realist theme with the first documentary feature in his post-presidential career as a film producer (with Michelle Obama) for Netflix, under the banner of their company Higher Ground Productions. It’s a workplace study from directors Steven Bognar and Julia Reichert that is absorbing, discomfiting and desperately sad. American Factory is incidentally another example of how “American” as the first word of a title supercharges the movie with irony (American Hustle, American Gangster, American Psycho). The factory in question is far from American.In 2014, the Chinese auto glass manufacturer Fuyao bought a former General Motors car plant in Dayton, Ohio, that had been closed since 2008 – promising investment and hundreds of new jobs. Fuyao and its chairman Cao Dewang (referred to as “Chairman Cao”) were rewarded with euphoric praise – in a state that had been crushed by unemployment – and more than $6m in subsidies from Ohio state taxpayers.The film shows how this good mood curdled as the workforce realised that to show their gratitude they were expected to conform to the Chinese culture of regimentation and submission, uncomplainingly working six or seven-day weeks, pushing up productivity at all costs and declining to make a fuss about decadent and lazy American indulgences such as lunch breaks and safety precautions. The management’s main concern was to crush any hint of a union. There is a major diplomatic incident at the opening ceremony when the Democratic Ohio state senator Sherrod Brown refers to the desirability of unions in his speech, to the displeasure of the Chinese management.The publicity for American Factory has suggested that this is a tragicomic story of a culture clash. Maybe. We are perpetually presented with the spectacle of the slight, deferential and uniformly clad Chinese workers, snapping to attention and occasionally singing the mournfully determined company song in contrast to the big, sloppy and resentful Americans whose bodies are too big for the hi-vis tabards that they are required to wear on their educational visit to the Fuyao factory in China. Perhaps it is not really a US-versus-China story but the age-old story of capital versus labour, supercharged with a new managerial determination to sweat every last cent from this unreliable human worker before he or she is replaced with a machine.There are toe-curling culture clash moments. It is excruciating when a motto is put up in the factory office: “Marching Forward To Be World Leading Glass Provider” – and none of the Americans can bring themselves to point out to their Chinese overlords that the word “the” is missing. When they go on their instructional trip to China and witness the militaristic shop floor discipline, there are cutaways to their aghast faces, making them look like Karren Brady on The Apprentice when she sees contestants doing something very wrong. It is in China that we learn that unions there are not loathed, because they are an arm of the communist state, and the thought of them objecting to or impeding the management of a state-sanctioned company is unthinkable. American unions are of course a very different matter, and Fuyao is shown to ruthlessly intimidate trade unionists. The Chinese are also shown having policy meetings about how to deal with their exotic US workforce and a manager is shown calmly saying that it is their responsibility to give the Americans guidance “because we are better than them”.This movie is released at a fraught moment in US politics. The country is on the verge of a full-scale trade war with China, and Donald Trump is being praised by the right for making deals and creating jobs in defiance of that Obama statement. But these are the deals and jobs that we are talking about. American workers will be smiled on if they work cheap – that is, after all, why Chinese goods and workers were beloved by America for so long. This could be nothing more than a bridgehead for a new invasion of machines: simply the prelude to a new era of automation in which the idea of a culture clash will be less meaningful. Some of the workers here are affectionate about their Chinese opposite numbers, but this is a sobering documentary in a minor key. American Factory is released on Netflix on 21 August."
Djon África review – globetrotting quest yields warmth and wonder,"Miguel Moreira’s Portuguese idler travels to Cape Verde to find his dad in in this meandering, lusciously shot drama",3,"There’s a charming, easy swing to this docu-fiction feature from documentary film-makers João Miller Guerra and Filipa Reis. It has a warmth and openness as it follows its nose across the landscape, building episodic encounters with nonprofessional local people into what could be called a quest narrative. Ruminating valuably on the nature of cultural belonging and exclusion, it’s amiably laid-back, though I have to confess I felt that a bit more storytelling structure and energy wouldn’t have gone amiss.The musician Miguel Moreira plays Djon, essentially a version of himself – a Portuguese guy whose family hails from Cape Verde, the island state and former Portuguese colony 350 miles off the west coast of Africa.Djon does little all day, loafing around his exasperated grandmother’s flat, hanging out with his girlfriend and occasionally loping out to help his sister on her shoplifting expeditions. But when an old lady in the street says that she knew his rascally, shiftless father in Cape Verde – the man who ran out on his family – and he looks just like him, Djon is moved to travel there on a mission to find the old man and find himself, too.I found myself smiling along to this film as likable Djon meets up with various people helping or hindering him, and the film looks great as it shows various places on the island. Where are we going with all this? A big discovery? Well, there is a discovery of sorts: Djon’s journey leads him to a truth about fatherhood and responsibility. An assemblage of set pieces and mood tableaux, and beautifully shot. Djon África is released in the UK on 16 August."
Gaza review – heartfelt chronicle of life under political siege,"This sombre, angry documentary captures a sense of ordinary life in the strip bordered by Egypt, Israel and the sea",4,"Garry Keane and Andrew McConnell’s heartfelt film about the unending misery of Gaza – now effectively a blockaded strip of land bounded by the Egyptian and Israeli borders and the Mediterranean Sea – has had a complex reception in some quarters since it premiered at Sundance earlier this year. Some have found it manipulative and politically reticent, in that it only fleetingly mentions Hamas, and includes footage of an Israeli bombardment but shows only stone-throwing as the response. There may be something in this. For instance, eyebrows have to be raised at the moment when an immobile child is shown with her eyes closed, we are encouraged to think she is dead but in a later scene she opens her eyes.Yet the film has real value as a compassionate human document, in showing ordinary people who courageously have to keep going somehow, in the grimmest of conditions, in a world where, as someone puts it, there is a “wall between the people of Gaza and life itself”. A young woman practises the cello, a young man records rap tracks, a theatre director rehearses a performance piece, a fisherman broods over the oppression of his industry – they are not allowed to fish more than three miles out, and the amount of fish that can be caught so close to shore is pitifully meagre. The sea is what the people of Gaza face: the one boundary that does not seem so brutal, something that should conceivably be a source of comfort, but is almost as unforgiving as the land barriers. A sombre, angry film about a people under political siege. Gaza is released in the UK on 9 August."
The Art of Racing in the Rain review – Kevin Costner as a lovable pup,Costner voices the inner monologue of a golden retriever in this three-hankie weeper with Milo Ventimiglia and Amanda Seyfried,3,"There comes a time in any critic’s life when you have to suppress whatever footling objections you have had, and salute the Kevin Costneraissance. You have to bow down to the pure demonic inspiration of creating a sentimental live-action family film about a lovable golden retriever, whose grouchy inner monologue is voiced by none other than Kevin Costner. You have to put your hands up and say: I get it. The dog looks adorable, intelligent and sad-eyed, and just as owners look like their pets, so dogs in weepie movies based on runaway New York Times bestselling books start to look like the veteran ex-romantic leads doing the voice – ie Kevin Costner. The morphing process is inexorable and by the closing credits, it’s basically Kevin Goldenretrievster we’re talking about, without CGI or the pointy ears that Judi Dench has to wear in Cats.Screenwriter Mark Bomback has adapted the three-hankie property from author and movie producer Garth Stein, and Simon Curtis directs. They have created a film aimed with lethal efficiency at your tear ducts like Chuck Norris putting his boot into your kidneys. Milo Ventimiglia plays Denny, a race car driver renowned for an ability to handle his vehicle in the rain – and perhaps also for piloting his family’s lives through a tear-fall of sadness. He’s devoted to his dog, Enzo (Costner), who with decent canine stoicism accepts the loss of attention when Denny falls in love with Eve (Amanda Seyfried) and then they have a baby. But a dark shadow falls when Eve begins to feel unwell. And who do you suppose is going to step up and keep the family together? The purely outrageous final scene addresses Enzo’s own belief that dogs can evolve upwards into homo sapiens. His canine existence looks dignified enough to me. The Art of Racing in the Rain is released in the UK and US on 9 August. This article was amended on 9 August 2019. It stated previously that the release date in the UK and the US was 9 April, not 9 August."
The Kitchen review – star cast can't save undercooked DC Comics disaster,"Melissa McCarthy, Tiffany Haddish and Elisabeth Moss struggle to rise above a cartoonish and shoddily constructed crime drama ",1,"The Kitchen, a late summer, female-led adaptation of a little-known DC comic, is the worst kind of bad movie.That’s because it has all the ingredients of a good movie, from a juicy premise to a stellar cast, yet it’s assembled with such staggering incompetency that from the very first scene it boils over into one star territory, all promise evaporating from the screen. The boredom and confusion that then follows is backgrounded by an almost angry frustration that someone could get something so potentially thrilling so very, very wrong.That someone would seem to be Andrea Berloff, the Oscar-nominated co-writer of Straight Outta Compton, who here makes her directorial debut while also singlehandedly writing the script. It’s refreshing to see a woman given the reins of a female-fronted DC project, given how it remains such a boys’ club but it’s then disheartening to see what an utter mess she makes of it, both with her risible dialogue and scrappy direction. She throws us into 70s New York with a swirling nighttime shot of the city and It’s a Man’s Man’s Man’s World clunkily explaining the overarching theme of the movie. In Hell’s Kitchen at the time, crime is a man’s business but when their gangster husbands get thrown in jail, it’s up to the wives to step in. Kathy (Melissa McCarthy), Ruby (Tiffany Haddish) and Claire (Elisabeth Moss) aren’t natural criminals but financial circumstances dictate that they need to do something and it doesn’t take long for them to realise they’re a better fit than they might have imagined.There are inevitable echoes of Steve McQueen’s electric thriller Widows, given the set-up, and it’s a comparison which harms The Kitchen in every conceivable way. While McQueen’s film delivered both sharp, impactful action and believably wrought female characters, Berloff’s chucks in three astonishingly underwritten women and coerces them through one confusingly plotted situation to the next. There’s a rhythm that feels off from the start, like hearing a song at the wrong speed or watching a percussion section fail to follow a beat. Scenes either end too soon or go on too long, fights are confusingly choreographed, reaction shots are strangely chosen, editing is baffling – it’s a swirling pot of bad decisions leading to an end dish that’s both undercooked and overheated. It wreaks of studio interference, a film that feels pulled apart and then haphazardly restitched in an editing suite by a committee of people desperate to get it released before swiftly moving on and all agreeing to never speak of it ever again.Tonally, Berloff can’t decide between broad cartoonish mayhem or gritty Scorsese-lite drama and instead veers maniacally between the two which means her garish excesses and paper-thin characters are often forced into awkward hard-edged solemnity. So much of the film clashes against itself, including, sadly, her cast who can’t quite sell themselves in territory they’re not usually found in. McCarthy, who delivered such an exquisite dramatic turn in last year’s wonderful Can You Ever Forgive Me?, struggles here, relying on her comedic instincts to react unconvincingly to mounting danger, meaning her performance often feels more like an SNL character. It’s a backward step for her but an even worse career move for Haddish, whose comic vibrancy in Girls Trip has been diminishing with each subsequent film. On paper, sidestepping into drama sounded like a smart way to combat audience fatigue but she’s unable to lift herself out of muted, one-note territory, delivering lines without conviction and never exuding the power of a woman who is finally, violently taking control of her life. Of the three it’s Moss, in a rare studio appearance, who comes out of it the least scathed, seeming more comfortable than her co-stars, albeit playing a woman beaten and raped by the men around her, depressingly not far from her most well-known small-screen role.The premise of women fighting against a patriarchal system in a particularly difficult time period in a particularly tough locale feels ever-prescient and even within the confines of comic book territory, there feels like a much smarter and more intricately layered film that could have been made here. But Berloff never manages to get underneath the surface, despite a number of failed attempts to provide social commentary, and as the film limps toward a shambolic, confusing conclusion, any hope that it might improve is replaced with relief that it’s finally about to end. It’s one of the most scattered and incoherent studio films in recent memory, made with such careless abandon that anyone brave enough to buy a ticket should automatically ask for a refund.The Kitchen is released in the US on 9 August and in the UK on 20 September"
Apocalypse Now: Final Cut review – crazed exposé of the heart of darkness,"From Marlon Brando’s extraordinary cameo to Dennis Hopper’s crazed photojournalist, Coppola’s epic ‘definitive’ cut of his brilliant 1979 war film is triumphant in restating the inhumanity of empire",5,"‘Someday this war’s gonna end,” is the sage comment from surf-crazed Wagner enthusiast Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore, brusquely played by Robert Duvall. In fact, when Francis Ford Coppola’s grandiose epic masterpiece Apocalypse Now was first unveiled in 1979, the Vietnam war had only ended four years previously, and the succeeding war between Vietnam and Cambodia (where the film’s climax is set) was in full swing.Coppola’s bad trip into south-east Asia was co-written by John Milius with narration written by Michael Herr. It was inspired by Joseph Conrad’s novel Heart of Darkness, Herr’s own Vietnam reportage-memoir Dispatches and maybe at one further remove by Rudyard Kipling’s lines about the US taking up the white man’s imperial burden. It was famously an ordeal for all concerned. The production involved a filming expedition in the Philippines that felt hardly less colossal and traumatic to the participants than the actual war, though it became commonplace in Hollywood’s Vietnam for the anguish of American soldiers, not that of the Vietnamese people themselves, to be seen as important. (The nearest that Vietnamese people get to actual importance in Apocalypse Now is the four South Vietnamese intelligence officers, executed by Col Kurtz as Communist spies, whose ID cards we briefly see.) Like Lawrence of Arabia, moreover, this is a film without women – or mostly.Now Apocalypse Now has resurfaced for its 40th-anniversary in what Coppola is calling his definitive final cut. Interestingly, this does not mean simply including everything he shot. He has removed some of the “Playmate” sequences that were in his 202-minute “Redux” edition from 2001, but this cut retains the extended “dinner party” scene with French planters in the jungle, like an encounter with angry imperial ghosts.Martin Sheen plays Captain Benjamin Willard, a troubled officer, recovering – or not recovering – from a breakdown caused by his last tour of Vietnam. He is tasked by hatchet-faced intelligence chiefs with travelling with a small crew upriver into Viet Cong territory and into Cambodia. There he is expected to track down the renegade Colonel Walter Kurtz – an extraordinary cameo by Marlon Brando – and “terminate his command”, because this once brilliant officer has, as the Brit imperialist used to say, gone native, and become drunk with power, ordering executions. He is rumoured to be revered as a chieftain, or worshipped as a pagan god, and lost his mind through having been vouchsafed some terrible vision of humanity in the jungle itself.And so Willard sets off into the Boschian chaos, encountering Kilgore, who gives him diversionary air cover to get his boat to the river’s strategic entry point with his bizarre “Air Mobile” helicopter cavalry attack blaring Wagner from the sound-system. It is one of the most staggering war-movie set pieces in history. Willard and his men carry on upriver: Tyrone (Laurence Fishburne), Lance (Sam Bottoms), Chef (Frederic Forrest), and Chief (Albert Hall) - until Willard arrives at the sinister jungle clearing itself, with corpses hung everywhere; they encounter Kurtz’s acolyte: the crazy, gurning photojournalist (Dennis Hopper) – a countercultural parody, like a cross between Charles Manson (whose fate Willard had noticed in a newspaper headline) and one of Manson’s followers. It is presumably this character who has painted the graffiti: “Our Motto: Apocalypse Now” on to a nearby rock.Brando’s charisma sells the climactic scenes with Willard; without his presence, the literary musings would be a little callow. But his unmistakably adenoidal whispered aria about tribespeople cutting off their children’s arms rather than submit to inoculation always delivers a sickening blow. Sheen, meanwhile, is strong and charismatic as Willard, becoming more fascinated and awestruck by Kurtz’s reputation the closer he gets to his quarry. Each time I watch this film, though, I always regret, just a little, that Willard hasn’t a bit more to say for himself, especially as he has this avowed need to “confront” Kurtz. But his mute presence is potent enough.Finally, Apocalypse Now finds its triumph in restating the inhumanity of empire. Like many a colonial planter, Colonel Kurtz finds it intensely pleasurable, even ecstatic, to feel himself superior to the subjugated peoples. Having tested his strength against theirs, he affects to admire their supposed primitive honesty and authenticity as superior to the white civilisation he has transcended. But having contemptuously left behind his former identity, he feels how desolate and futile is his existence as both human and god. Apocalypse Now: Final Cut is released in the UK on 13 August and in the US on 15 August."
The Candidate review – corruption and paranoia at the Spanish seaside,Antonio de la Torre is magnetic as a politician at the centre of a web of betrayal in Rodrigo Sorogoyen’s slow-burn thriller,3,"This is one of those rare films that starts as a slog but grows progressively more engrossing as it develops. It finally delivers a wallop of a finale, a concluding 15 minutes crackling with suspense and left-field twists – but it’s really quite hard work at first, presenting a bewildering blizzard of dialogue that largely obscures what the hell is going on. It starts by introducing an enigmatic assemblage of shadowy politicians noshing and joshing together in a Spanish seaside restaurant. Gradually, party apparatchik Manuel (the intensely watchable Antonio de la Torre, whose middle-aged features are carved with dimples and oddly angled worry lines) emerges as the protagonist of an offbeat crime thriller seemingly set 10 or 15 years ago, when Blackberries were the upper-middle-class smartphone of choice and iPhones were just coming on to the market.The technology is significant, coming into play as assorted means of surveillance are deployed by Manuel and his confederates to blackmail and betray each other. The contours of the corruption they have colluded in together become clearer as details leak out, although by the end some may still be wondering what exactly the bad things were that these guys did.Ultimately it doesn’t really matter. The point is that although Manuel is just as greedy and venal as the others, he at least feels some redeeming familial loyalty to his wife (Mónica López) and teenage daughter (María de Nati) who are suddenly at risk of losing more than just their plush lifestyle. Director Rodrigo Sorogoyen, whose last feature May God Save Us earned positive reviews, finds a cinematic correlative to the growing sense of paranoia and panic in the jittering handheld camerawork and mosquito-like whine of the EDM soundtrack that grows incrementally more menacing.The Candidate is released in the UK on 2 August"
Charming review – a badly botched attempt at fixing fairytale sexism,Prince Charming is given his allure by an evil spell … and is soon fighting off a trio of simpering princesses who stare at shoes,2,"Mothers, lock up your daughters – the under 10s. Whatever you do, keep them away from this animated fairytale adventure running on 13% girl power. An addition to the Wicked- and Maleficent-inspired genre of revisionist backstories, this movie is here to explain why Prince Charming, that floppy haired stud always up for a spot of princess-rescuing and nonconsensual kissing, is so impossible for women to resist. It turns out a spell is involved. The script shoehorns in a feisty working-class heroine for a bit of feminist wokeness but otherwise maintains high standards of princessy simpering and unhealthy gender stereotypes.If you thought Prince Charming was an irredeemably dull character, you were right. Wilmer Valderrama is the voice of preening Prince Philippe, cursed by an evil fairy to steal the heart of every woman who claps eyes on him. Only the kiss of true love will break the spell, but poor Philippe is conflicted. Which of the three fair maidens to whom he is currently engaged should he marry: Snow White, Sleeping Beauty or Cinderella? Or could it be that his heart truly belongs to the badass female bandit Lenore (Demi Lovato)?Somehow singers Avril Lavigne, G.E.M. and Ashley Tisdale have been persuaded to voice the three princesses. And there’s actually a very funny scene when they discover that their prince is the same guy and share the stories of their toxic meet-cutes: “My prince found me passed out on the floor. He did what anyone else would do. He kissed me. In five seconds we were engaged.” But as characters, they’re all brainless bridezillas who swish about like beauty-pageant contestants, hands on jutting hips. Sure, they’re supposed to be under a spell, but they act like they’ve been lobotomised. Poor Cinders actually has the line: “Oooh, I like shoes.”Charming is released in the UK on 2 August."
"Balance, Not Symmetry review – Biffy Clyro art-school drama topples into cliche",Bria Vinaite again proves her star quality in this earnest coming-of-age film co-scripted by Biffy Clyro frontman Simon Neil ,2,"There are moments you may have to bite your lip very hard to stifle harrumphs of exasperation watching this drifty on-the-the-fly Glaswegian indie drama about a young woman grieving for her dad and struggling to finish her art-school graduation show. Written by director Jamie Adams in collaboration with Biffy Clyro frontman Simon Neil – whose band provides the soundtrack – the whole thing has the tentative, incomplete feel of an improv actors’ project.BlacKkKlansman’s Laura Harrier gives a blank performance as Caitlin, an American-Scot who grew up in New York but is studying art in Glasgow. The film begins with her dad’s funeral, after which Caitlin hastily heads back to college where she shares a flat with her fun-loving best friend Hannah (luminous Bria Vinaite from The Florida Project). In the studio, Caitlin is trying to find her voice as an artist, so naturally there are plenty of scenes in which she stares frowningly at a blank canvas. Worse are the deep conversations about art that may make you feel like you’re trapped in the corner of a party at 2am by a guy with merlot-stained teeth: “I don’t want it to look like art. I want you to walk past it and feel something raw.”Adams and Neil have spoken to the Guardian about losing their mothers in their 20s and channelling that loss into the film, though you may wonder why they projected their shared experience on to a female character. Still, there are some memorable scenes here – one as a Turner-winning artist arrives to examine the students’ show; the ferocity of her gaze is electric. And Vinaite is such a natural and authentic screen presence. She deserves a lead role soon.Balance, Not Symmetry is released in the UK on 2 August."
Animals review – Holliday Grainger paints poignant portrait of singledom,A handsome newcomer triggers fallout and existential crisis in this wisecracking adaptation of Emma Jane Unsworth’s novel,3,"Emma Jane Unsworth has adapted her 2014 novel for the screen and the resulting movie, directed by the Australian film-maker Sophie Hyde, is flawed but interesting, kept upright by the steely core of Holliday Grainger’s performance. It’s an unexpectedly subdued film about the mortality of friendships and relationships, and there is also, as with so many other semi-autobiographical fictions, a subsidiary pleasure in wondering which elements are based on truth.Laura (Grainger) and Tyler (Alia Shawkat, from TV’s Arrested Development) are best friends who live in Dublin; they’re single, they love going out for cocktails and have developed a kind of sub-Holly Golightly private language about the ironic sophistication of it all. Laura is a would-be writer who has been working on a novel for almost 10 years and Tyler has a dead-end job. The approaching trauma of being in their 30s is worsened when Laura meets an impossibly handsome man called Jim (Fra Fee) who is a talented classical pianist. This creates a Withnail-y loyalty crisis with Tyler, who acidly condemns the outrageously nice and well turned-out Jim as someone with the “shoes of an undertaker and the smile of a despot”.But it isn’t just Tyler who is thrown into turmoil. With her novel showing no sign of being published, Laura is left to wonder whether marriage – a convention to whose trappings she has been fundamentally indifferent – has turned out to be the endpoint of her whole existence. Will any defiant moment of singledom or hedonism endanger this precious new future, or would it be the last hurrah of youth?Some of the wisecracking dialogue falls a bit flat and the narrative line is occasionally uncertain, but Grainger creates a watchable quarterlife crisis.Animals is released in the UK on 2 August."
The Great Hack review – searing exposé of the Cambridge Analytica scandal,This chilling documentary lays bare the cynicism and chaos surrounding the data research company that harvested information from millions of Facebook users,5,"‘Data rights are human rights” is the rallying cry of this gripping, challenging documentary by Karim Amer and Jehane Noujaim, about the biggest scandal of our time: the gigantic question mark over the legality of the Brexit vote.It is about the Trump campaign, the Leave.EU campaign and many other reckless electoral adventures all over the world and their connection with Cambridge Analytica, the British data research company that cunningly harvested information from millions of Facebook users and their friends via an innocuous-seeming “personality” questionnaire. They put this gigantic database to lucrative work with machine-tooled marketing campaigns for Trump and the Brexiters; after the company declared bankruptcy, its documentation may never come to light.At the centre of the film is Brittany Kaiser, a former Cambridge Analytica employee who blows the whistle on her employers’ connections, including those with the Bad Boys of Brexit, whose bad-tempered éminence grise Arron Banks is now trying to silence Observer journalist Carole Cadwalladr – as well as this film – with legal threats.We are aware of these issues in the first place only because of the magnificently tough investigative reporting by Cadwalladr, who asks if we can ever again have a free and fair election. She has had to face down bullying and supercilious condescension from many quarters. The Great Hack is also about the US media academic David Carroll who launched a legal campaign in the UK to force Cambridge Analytica to reveal their “data report” on him. I was reminded of historian Timothy Garton Ash’s efforts to find his Stasi file, written by spies in the former East Germany. Ash was successful, but Carroll will probably never see his data digital dossier.There is evidence pointing to campaign finance laws being broken. Yet perhaps the larger point is that these were framed in the quaint era of printed posters and ads in newspapers, and analogue television. These laws are not fit for purpose. The data weaponisers are laughing at them, and us.Trump and Brexit won on a knife edge and Cambridge Analytica’s triumph was to identify the wobblers, the undecideds, the could-go-either-way-ers in the middle: the “persuadables”. This narrow band of voter opinion in the centre is all-important, like the “tipping point” Malcolm Gladwell identified as the key moment in a viral phenomenon, or that stage in a game of blackjack that card-counters recognise is their moment to bet 10 times their usual stake and beat the house.The data attackers could go all in, using their underhand knowledge to bombard these psycho-profiled targets, to push these persuadables’ buttons and tip them over the edge with Facebook ads that popped up intimately on their smartphones, miraculously confirming their prejudices, playing on their insecurities, magnifying and warping their worries: people who didn’t realise that their private data-identity had been sold to people who as a result could now personally solicit them without their knowing.Perhaps the most chilling part of the film shows that a Cambridge Analytica operative worked on a campaign in Trinidad and Tobago in 2013, inciting a certain strand of the population – assessed as liable to support the clients’ opponents – not to vote, creating a bogus grassroots anti-establishment campaign with the ironic slogan “Do So!” The point of course was not to “do so” or do anything at all, not to vote, in fact: an insidious argument for apathy. Anyone who says voting is a waste of time needs to watch this film, if only for this segment.The Great Hack repeatedly plays a recording of Cambridge Analytica execs giggling about their role in the Brexit campaign, a role they had wanted to deny: “Oops, we won!” Oops indeed. However gung-ho they were about foreign clients, the good boys of Cambridge Analytica were clearly a bit sheepish about the triumph closer to home and, like besuited Westminster Brexiters such as Boris Johnson, imagined simply an exciting bit of risk-free disruption to boost their brand. What they helped bring about was dishonesty, cynicism and chaos. Released in the UK and on Netflix from 24 July."
Lea Salonga review – musicals star evokes whole new world of stories,"Palladium, LondonThe voice of Miss Saigon and Princess Jasmine controls the audience as finely as the vibrato in her expressive vocals",4,"Musical-theatre singers are in an odd position: they need to be distinctive but not too distinctive, powerful but not eccentric. The Filipina singer Lea Salonga has been striking this balance perfectly on Broadway and West End stages since starring in Miss Saigon 30 years ago, aged only 18. She sings with perfect diction and “acts out” every lyric she performs, but her secret weapon is a fierce yet controlled vibrato. It rarely strays beyond a few microtones either side of the principal note, and, unlike an opera soprano’s vibrato, retains an intensity and focus that never detracts from the melody.As well as performing songs from musicals in which she has starred – Aladdin, Mulan, Les Misérables and Miss Saigon – her actorly skill ekes new truths from familiar showtunes and pop standards, such as a duet arrangement of A-ha’s Take on Me for voice and acoustic guitar, or a conversational version of Tracy Chapman’s Fast Car.But, in her slightly schoolmarmish way, she’s also a fine master of ceremonies. She orchestrates the audience to sing the backing vocals to This Is Me from The Greatest Showman; she turns Frozen’s Let It Go into a Disney singalong: when one gay man in the audience responds to the line “and it looks like I’m the queen” by standing up and whooping “Yas queen!”, Salonga responds, like much of the audience, by applauding and giggling hysterically.Memorably, she invites a random man from the audience to duet with her on A Whole New World, with tonight’s lucky winner being Mark from Salonga’s home city of Manila. “Thank you for perpetuating the stereotype that all Filipinos are great singers,” she says, drily."
Who Do You Think You Are? review – Harry Potter and the diamond heist,Daniel Radcliffe is the first of a new crop of celebrities to get the genealogy show’s treatment – and the tale he uncovers is truly tragic,4,"As a format, Who Do You Think You Are? (BBC One) appears to have an endless supply of steam. Now in its 16th series, it manages to spin yarns about the long-dead relatives of celebrities that are as compelling as ever.Part of its appeal lies in its ability to overturn expectations so reliably: uh-oh, you think at the beginning of every episode, this one might be really boring. It never is.The Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe is the first of the new crop of celebrities to get the treatment. He admits to knowing little about his ancestors – he can’t recall his great-grandfather’s name. “I want to say Phil, but that’s not right,“ he says. “This is very embarrassing.” He does remember, however, that this great-grandfather had killed himself.Radcliffe is in possession of a photo album and a family tree drawn by his Granny Pat just before he was born (he is listed as “bump”). From this, Radcliffe learns that his great-grandfather on his mother’s side was called Samuel; that he was one of nine siblings – the first of them to be born in England; and that his surname, Gershon, was later anglicised to Gresham.It also turns out that Radcliffe has a living relative he doesn’t know about – also descended from his great-great-grandparents – living in north London. It must have been more of a surprise for Louis Gershon to find out he was related to Harry Potter, but he kept calm all the same.Louis produces a large photograph of their common forebear – the original Louis Gershon – to whom Radcliffe bears a striking resemblance. “That’s where I get the eyebrows from,” he says.The original Louis, born in Germany, had spent a number of years in South Africa, where most of his children were born. “He was something in diamonds,” says present-day Louis, “and that’s what was going on out there.” But the census showed that, by 1901, original Louis had relocated to London and set up a jewellery business in Hatton Garden.By 1930, Samuel (Radcliffe’s great-grandfather) had taken over the business with his brother, got married to Radcliffe’s great-grandmother Raie, and moved to Southend-on-Sea. We already know that his story won’t end well, but the strangest twist is yet to come.In 1936, the Gershon jewellery business was burgled – the equivalent of £250,000 in today’s money was taken – but the police declined to pursue an investigation. It was their contention that the heist was bogus, the basis for a fraudulent insurance claim. The police contended that the Gershons had form: two very similar burglaries had been perpetrated in the preceding decade, followed by disputes with insurers.The family also faced prejudice. An informant’s letter, tracked down by one of the programme’s investigators, reminded the police that Samuel was “a Jew, and that Jews are so frequently responsible for the bringing down of their own business premises, and thefts (so-called) committed in their offices.”“There’s a lot to dig into in that one sentence,” says Radcliffe, visibly stricken by the language. Samuel killed himself five months later. Within weeks, his wife had legally changed her name.With every episode of Who Do You Think You Are?, there is, as Radcliffe puts it, a lot to dig into. And this is just the half of it – the rest of the episode concerned Radcliffe’s father’s line, Northern Ireland and four brothers who served in the first world war.Radcliffe makes for an amiable, self-effacing and even-handed conduit, clearly moved by what he discovers, but not gripped by the need to get emotional on behalf of people he never met. Above all, he shows a lot of patience with a format that can sometimes seem like a forced treasure hunt: you must go to Southend, where you will find a historian in a cafe; he, in turn, will send you straight back to Hatton Garden. The locations aren’t necessarily evocative enough to warrant all the travel.As ever, it is the documents themselves that bring these stories to life: business directories, marriage certificates, witness statements – even, in this case, a suicide note. Names and dates diligently recorded in loopy pencil and faded ink, mountains of pages stored in defiance of the great human business of forgetting – it is all out there somewhere, waiting, and that is why Who Do You Think You Are? will never get old."
Varda by Agnès review – inspiring look at a life in cinema,"The pioneering Belgian film-maker and artist Agnès Varda presented this film at the Berlin international film festival in February this year; one month later she died. A documentary that takes the form of an illustrated lecture, it’s designed as a swansong, a greatest hits showcase that revisits and consolidates her extensive body of work. Yet despite the formal setting (an opera house transformed into a cinema and filled with rapt film students), Varda’s tone remains generously intimate, friendly and unpretentious. At 90 and dressed in her signature head-to-toe purple, she is lucid and funny, able to parse her “failures” (such as 1995’s Robert De Niro-starring One Hundred and One Nights) as well as her successes. Running just shy of two hours, it’s a little long but, in Varda’s defence, there’s a lot of material to get through.",4,"Excited by “dreams and reveries”, cats and potatoes, beaches, mirrors, social justice movements (she made films about the Black Panthers and “the feminist fight”) and, of course, her beloved late husband, Jacques Demy, Varda’s range is truly inspiring. Also inspiring is the playful, resourceful way she navigated the technological changes that came with the 21st century.Varda talks about the three governing principles of film-making as “inspiration”, “creation” and “sharing”. Describing the editing process of 1962’s Cléo from 5 to 7, she explains how she played with depicting the passing of time, because it “feels different depending on whether we’re waiting for something or having fun”. What’s so invigorating is the way she gives each principle equal weighting, discussing her formal decisions, such as Cléo’s editing or the tracking shots that move right to left in 1985’s Vagabond, with the same intensity and enthusiasm as her more existential motivations (she describes her 1965 summer bummer classic Le Bonheur as “a beautiful summer peach with a worm inside”)."
The Brink review – queasily fascinating,"The fly-on-the-wall approach to this documentary about Stephen K Bannon, self-appointed ringmaster of the nationalist movement, will not please everyone. Director Alison Klayman chooses to observe rather than to interrogate. This is not a film that asks tough questions. But Klayman’s unthreatening camera slips into the safe space where the American reveals more about himself than perhaps he realises. It follows Bannon from his fall from grace within the Trump inner circle to a rebranding and resurgence that sees him cast as an orchestrator and kingmaker for aspiring fascists around the world. It’s unsavoury viewing – flies on the wall are rarely attracted by the sweet smell of roses after all – but it’s queasily fascinating nonetheless.",4,
Stuber review – nothing to see here,"Dave Bautista might be able to bench press the combined weight of the rest of the cast in this inept action comedy – but he sure as hell can’t carry a movie. He plays Vic, a driven police detective who is temporarily unable to drive (laser eye surgery has rendered him practically blind). The muscle-bound Mr Magoo calls an Uber and commandeers the car and its driver, Stu (Kumail Nanjiani), in order to bring to justice a cop-killing, drug-dealing martial arts whiz (Iko Uwais). It’s not just Vic who is shortsighted. It takes a special strain of movie myopia to cast a fighter as skilled as Uwais, and then shoot the action with the kind of seizure cinematography that blurs everything into an indistinct scrum of fists and feet. In the absence of sharp writing, Bautista and Nanjiani adopt the blunt-weapon approach, shrieking their lines at each other as if they’re trying to hold a conversation from opposite sides of an eight-lane motorway. It’s painfully unfunny stuff.",1,
Only You review – a perfectly realised story of love and longing,The course of true love runs less than smooth in this engrossing debut feature from writer-director Harry Wootliff,5,"Here’s something special – a terrifically engrossing drama about two wholly believable characters, made with the kind of wit, honesty and raw emotional intimacy that pierces right to the heart of their relationship. Vividly rendered, and filled with tangible yearning, it strikes a balance between romantic passion and mundane domesticity, as the skin-prickling attraction of new love is tested by the day-to-day tribulations of real life.At the heart of the film’s charms are a pair of flawless performances by Laia Costa and Josh O’Connor, both superbly directed by writer-director Harry Wootliff in her very impressive feature debut. Costa, who did such breathtaking work in the one-take German drama Victoria, is Elena, a Spanish émigré living in Glasgow. Stumbling home from a New Year’s Eve party, she finds herself sharing a cab with fresh-faced postgrad-student-cum-DJ Jake, played with wide-eyed charm by Josh O’Connor, the arresting star of God’s Own Country. One thing leads to another and they wind up back at Elena’s flat, where Jake compliments her vinyl collection (“it was my dad’s …”) and they dance to a classic cut from Elvis Costello’s Blood & Chocolate album. “How old do you think I am?” she asks when he tells her he’s 26. “My age, or maybe older … 28?”A relationship begins – tentative, yet thrilling – and Jake moves in, countering Elena’s falteringly offered revelation that she’s actually in her mid-30s with the words: “You are everything I ever wanted.” She’s convinced that his youth will be their downfall; that their lives and desires will be out of sync in a few years’ time. But Jake insists that he’s “a grownup” and they are meant for each other. In fact, he says, they should start a family straight away.What follows is a beautifully observed slide from the romance of “Let’s just see what happens” into the more testing waters of actively trying for a baby, with all the hopes and disappointments that ensue. While Elena’s friends all seem to be conceiving without effort, the mechanical routine of calendar-watching – and the prospect of possible medical intervention – starts to cloud the changing seasons of their relationship. “Maybe this isn’t how I imagined us having a baby,” admits Jake, seemingly confirming Elena’s fears that he’s not yet ready to face reality, but is still chasing some idealised dream of love.It’s hard to overstate the dexterity with which Wootliff (who was Bafta nominated for her short film Nits in 2004) juggles the tough and tender elements of this remarkably clear-eyed drama. Aided by Shabier Kirchner’s up-close yet unobtrusive hand-held cinematography, Wootliff conjures an electrifying intimacy between her central couple that reminded me of the spark between Felicity Jones and Anton Yelchin in Drake Doremus’s 2011 gem Like Crazy. There’s genuine tenderness here, along with the flirty excitement and heady rush of new love. But Wootliff (who shares story credit with Matthieu de Braconier) is equally adept at evoking the pressures of a relationship under stress, as aspirations turn to anxieties, and dreamy embraces are augmented by more clinical interventions. At times, I was unexpectedly reminded of Nic Roeg’s Don’t Look Now – that strange but familiar blend of passion, grief, and aching longing that is so rarely seen on film.Smartly flipping age and gender stereotypes, Wootliff evokes the background noise of her lovers’ dilemma, showing them in outwardly happy situations (a gathering of Elena’s family-building friends; a visit to Jake’s dad, played with huge warmth by Peter Wight) in which fleeting glances speak volumes about their growing detachment. Anyone with experience of the struggles Jake and Elena face will recognise the acutely observed details of Wootliff’s drama. Yet on a more universal level, it’s the depiction of the underlying imbalances and imperfections of any relationship that hits home. Whether it’s Jake’s idealised memories of his parents’ marriage, or Elena’s inherited fears about her own perceived failings (“sometimes I think it’s because I’m a bad person…”), this is strikingly perceptive and insightful storytelling.Musically, the piano and cello themes of Emilie Levienaise-Farrouch’s sparse score are counterposed against an eclectic jukebox selection of tracks, most notably the anguished vocals of Elvis Costello’s I Want You – one of the most emotionally astute deployments of a pop song in a movie since Barry Jenkins’s killer use of Barbara Lewis’s Hello Stranger in Moonlight. As the title Only You ironically suggests, with love comes loneliness that can both create and fill a void. This film captures those competing elements perfectly. And I loved it."
Our Time review – raw scenes from a failing marriage,"For his latest picture, the Mexican director Carlos Reygadas picks through the spilled guts of a failing marriage. It’s a move away from the spiritual concerns of previous films, particularly Silent Light, and towards more profane preoccupations. Juan, a celebrated poet and the owner of a cattle ranch that breeds fighting bulls (the swilling testosterone evoked by the backdrop is no accident), is in an open relationship with his wife, Esther. But their marriage is tested when Esther falls in love with another man – American horse trainer Phil – and cloaks the relationship in heady secrecy. The somewhat flat digital cinematography is given raw texture by the churning tensions and sparks of jealousy between the characters.",3,"There’s an additional layer here – Reygadas plays Juan, his real-life wife, Natalia López, plays Esther, and their own children appear as the couple’s kids. Reygadas has claimed that the film is a work of fiction and that the casting decision was a matter of expediency rather than autobiography. And yet there’s a sense of stinging exposure in certain scenes, of uncovered emotional wounds. One is especially notable: heightened sound design makes a sequence that shows a drunk and anguished Juan bursting in on his wife and her lover almost unbearable.There is also, it should be added, a degree of self-indulgence that is magnified by Reygadas’s decision to put his own family in the frame. The film explores the mechanics of infatuation and marital power tussles; it also, at one point, explores the mechanics of Esther’s truck – the camera is positioned first inside the engine, and then somewhere near the front axle. Which is all very well – Reygadas has made a career out of a confrontational lyricism, finding poetry in images that could be considered mundane or even ugly – but the film is nearly three hours long. You have to question how much time spent loitering next to the carburettor is actually justified."
Ibiza: The Silent Movie review – bacchanalia ancient and modern,"Julien Temple’s experimental documentary is, I suppose, a silent movie in the sense that it was made without synchronised recorded sound. Like its genre forebears, it swaps dialogue for title cards. Yet with its booming dance music soundtrack, selected by DJ Fatboy Slim, it could hardly be called silent. Opening with Joe Smooth’s 1987 house track Promised Land, the film tells of the paradisiacal Mediterranean island and its Phoenician beginnings; how those ancient bacchanals paved the way for super-parties and mega-clubs such as Pacha, Ushuaïa and Amnesia. Temple’s chopped and screwed approach combines archive footage of ravers with fictionalised re-enactments, stock footage and animated illustrations to explain Ibiza’s fascinating geographical and political histories as well as its legacy as a decadent tourist destination.",4,
Midsommar review – dread-free horror,Sunny Swedish paganism tests the patience in Ari Aster’s meandering follow-up to Hereditary,2,"A little girl wears a crown of flowers and stands nose-to-nose with a grizzly bear, peering into its beady eyes. This scene appears as a painting hanging in the apartment of graduate student Dani (Florence Pugh), foreshadowing the stand-off between this young woman and her own grisly nightmare in Ari Aster’s uneven follow-up to horror smash Hereditary.Dani’s four-year relationship with anthropology student Christian (Jack Reynor) is already on the rocks when she joins him and buddies Josh (William Jackson Harper), Mark (Will Poulter, proving himself as a gifted comic) and “authentic hippie” Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren) for a nine-day festival celebrating midsummer at Pelle’s home in rural Sweden. The Hårga community wear a uniform of wholesome white linen, greeting their guests with a recorder serenade and hallucinogenic teas; a sinister tapestry illustrates a love ritual in which a woman seasons a pie with her pubic hairs before offering it to her beloved. Aster, I believe, is taking the piss.Aster lets the Hårga’s rituals unfold over tedious stretches of time (the film runs nearly two and a half hours), revelling in geometric images, pagan symbols, sunbleached Swedish fields and trippy CGI; flower crowns bloom and trees liquefy as the characters lose their heads. Annoying then, that there is no puzzle to solve. As the film sways drunkenly towards its inevitable conclusion, Aster fails to conjure a sense of dread or even tension – essential qualities of the horror genre.Pugh is riveting as a woman unravelling, straining to stifle an animal cry; wounded but alert and fighting beneath the weighted blanket of grief. The film works better as a comedy than a horror, skewering its ignorant US tourists, and better still as a spiteful relationship drama. Aster wrote the film after an ugly breakup. Watching the already weakening bond disintegrate between Dani and her passive-aggressive PhD student boyfriend is its own perverse pleasure."
Don't Look Now review – Roeg's scary movie can still make you jump,"From its red stalker to its eerie strangers, this suspenseful classic set a template for horror – but its sexual intimacy adds a dramatic counterpoint few films can match",5,"This week sees the restored rerelease of Nicolas Roeg’s eerie masterpiece Don’t Look Now from 1973, adapted by Allan Scott and Chris Bryant from the short story by Daphne du Maurier. It’s a film that apart from everything else popularised the classic scary-movie template: start off with a family tragedy, follow it with an apparently therapeutic retreat or escape, an illusory easing of the sadness burden, then pivot to a horror nightmare, in such a way that the grotesque denouement appears to flower as a mysteriously logical escalation of that initial heartbreak. It’s a form taken up by Lars von Trier’s Antichrist and, this week, by Ari Aster’s Midsommar.Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland play Laura and John, a grieving couple whose young daughter has died in a freak accident. John is an architectural historian and restorer whose work takes him and Laura to Venice – of all the places to go to after your child has died by drowning.Laura is buttonholed by two elderly English ladies, Wendy and Heather (played by Clelia Matania and Hilary Mason), who claim to know that their daughter is happy beyond the grave. Meanwhile, John sees a tiny figure flitting in and out of the mysterious passageways, wearing a red coat. Is this the ghost of his daughter, who adored her shiny red mac?The colour red is elegantly controlled by Roeg as the central motif in a mosaic of images, subliminal flashes of fear or premonitions of death that speckle John’s traumatised thoughts. Having watched this film many times, and pondered the importance of the red coat and the film’s status in the horror canon, I am still struck by how different its effects are to those of most scary films (despite that narrative influence), although it still manages one of the biggest jump scares in film history, the Fosbury flop of jump scares, when John is wobbling on the high and heartstoppingly unsafe scaffolding to check on a fresco inside the church he’s working on. We glimpse a plank of wood fall through the air, then cut back to John in such a way that we almost forget, for a microsecond, that we have noticed this dangerous object flying towards his head. It’s another of Roeg’s triumphant collaborations with his editor Graeme Clifford.Then there is the famous sex scene, intercut with shots of the couple dressing afterwards in a very adult, loved-up glow. This was not in Du Maurier’s original story, although it is important to realise how sexual adventure and Venice are intertwined in the drama’s DNA: for Du Maurier, “Venetian” was slang for gay love. Sex scenes in the movies are generally between people who are having sex for the first time. Laura and John are having married sex: they have had sex many times before this, although this is surely the first time since the death of their child, so the sex is a kind of redemptive miracle, a scene that is moving in its frankness and intimacy. Sutherland and Christie are an overwhelmingly convincing married couple, despite being apart for much of the film.Venice itself has never been more passionately captured on screen. Almost every movie is content with sugary tourist cliches, but Don’t Look Now, despite showing the obvious tourist locations, always shows it as a real working city.Lastly, that title: it always seems to belong to a much brasher, pulpier and more self-satirising horror film. In fact, the only moment to which the title applies is the scene where John is shocked to see the two old ladies in church and turns away – evidently before they can see him looking at them. They of course know something about John that he does not: his terrible prophetic gift that serves only to condemn him more utterly to his terrible fate."
Ibiza: The Silent Movie review – history for hedonists in bikinis,"Julien Temple’s documentary mines the Spanish island’s past for nuggets of interest, but the facts that matter are clubbing and beaches",2,"We get a scattering of semi-interesting facts in Julien Temple’s promo-video-style history of Ibiza, which is a “silent movie” in the sense that there is no voiceover or recorded speech, and occasional intertitles. It more resembles the director’s own previous collage experiments, an assemblage of archive material and tongue-in-cheek filmed reconstructions.Temple has one nice gag: the island’s name was originally taken from Bes, the Egyptian god of fertility, hedonism and dance, and so Bez (from the Happy Mondays and Black Grape) gets a brief cameo playing Bes. Maybe the whole movie should have been centred on Bes/Bez, though that might have pushed Bez’s performance capabilities beyond their limits.Temple briskly takes us through Ibiza’s place in classical history as the alleged birthplace of Hannibal, and its agonised history during the 1930s. (Temple flashes up as an intertitle the somewhat glib running commentary: “Both sides commit appalling atrocities during the civil war.”) We hear about its position as a place of refuge for intellectuals and artists such as Walter Benjamin, and as a postwar mecca for beatniks and hippies. Then Ibiza becomes another part of Franco’s mission to beef up Spain’s tourist income, marketing it to holidaymakers. (Temple crisply calls this the “fascist administration of paradise”.)In the 90s, the new era of superclubbing dawns: an opportunity for fun, dancing, profit and money-laundering. But each and every one of these interesting things about Ibiza is subordinate to the thing that the movie thinks is crucial: shots of young women in bikinis.The historical bits are just the tiny bikini of quasi-knowledge, the wet T-shirt of supposed fact, semi-covering what’s important. And some of the facts are curiously presented: the revelation that a fugitive Nazi was discovered on Ibiza in 2006 is accompanied by frowny-face Nazi emojis."
Penny Slinger: Out of the Shadows review – fascinating career re-examination,"The artist’s life is essential viewing for anyone with an interest in British art, second-wave feminism or experimental cinema",4,"Director Richard Kovitch’s documentary is essential viewing for anyone with a passing interest in either British art, second-wave feminism or experimental cinema from the mid-20th century. That’s because the film’s subject, the London-born artist Penny Slinger, slinked through all those realms, creating startling work in collage, film and theatre that was both quintessentially of its time and ahead of times to come, prefiguring themes that would crop up again in the shock imagery of YBAs in the 1990s and beyond.This fascinating career re-examination drifts serenely back and forth between archive footage, clips from the films Slinger co-created and performed in (The Other Side of the Underneath, Vibration) and long closeups on Slinger’s 2D work. Interview clips with Slinger herself weave in and out, as well as talking-head snippets from her former partners (in every sense) and collaborators such as Peter Whitehead and Susanka Fraey, as well as assorted explicators such as the writer Michael Bracewell, artists Jane and Louise Wilson, and Antony Penrose, son of the artist Lee Miller and ICA co-founder Roland Penrose, who was a significant patron of Slinger’s back in the day.What’s revealed is work informed by the surrealism of the 1920s and 30s, especially Max Ernst, about whom Slinger wrote her graduate thesis – that highly sexualised and erotic but still provocative and not easily classifiable artist. An art world “It Girl” of her day, the strikingly beautiful Slinger was her own model, subject and canvas, and appears throughout, frequently naked and unafraid. It’s not hard to see how she ended up getting into tantric stuff later in life and more doctrinaire types may feel uncomfortable about how her work cropped up, seemingly with her consent, in straightforwardly pornographic contexts such as Knave magazine, just as easily as it did in Spare Rib, the feminist bible back in the day. Her interest in magic, the occult, and Jungian psychology (there’s a lot of chatter about archetypes) really embeds Slinger in a sinister side of the 1960s, while the predominantly monochrome look of the work and scratchy cinematography, even in the original interviews, makes the whole documentary feel like something dredged up from the archives rather than a work completed two years ago."
"Thom Yorke: Anima review – angst, anguish, paranoia and … jokes?","The Radiohead frontman gives a glimpse of his fun side on this intriguing, infuriating solo album. But you’ll have to listen closely",3,"In one sense, Thom Yorke’s new solo album makes for an intriguing study in contrasts with its predecessor, Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes (2014). That album was quietly slipped out one Friday afternoon accompanied by a press release that concentrated less on the music itself than its experimental delivery via pay-gated BitTorrent files and what that might mean for the industry. Five years on, Anima arrives on an old-fashioned record label, preceded by a lengthy interview in which Yorke detailed the album’s themes (“a sense of anxiety … expressed through a dystopian environment,” he offered, blindsiding anyone assuming Anima would offer more of Yorke’s carefree party anthems), and by an accompanying film directed by Paul Thomas Anderson.It’s tempting to say that’s where the differences between Anima and its predecessor end. You could reasonably ask, without being snarky, what the point of a Thom Yorke solo album is. After all, Radiohead are a pretty expansive band. They’re evidently not under any pressure to knock out hit singles, they pack out stadiums while playing pretty anti-stadium material and, while resolutely not a one-man show, they’re clearly driven by their frontman’s artistic vision. So what’s the itch that can’t be scratched within their confines? Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes suggested Yorke’s solo albums are largely a repository for electronic material that isn’t focused enough for the day job, and this one follows suit.The gulf between Anima and Radiohead’s most recent official release, the Moon Shaped Pool outtake Ill Wind, certainly isn’t one of mood. Both are twitchy, paranoid, filled with dark intimations about the future. Both take what you might call the Yorke worldview: that life is a waking nightmare and everything is completely and perhaps irreparably screwed. In fairness, Yorke has been carrying on like this for decades, over the course of which he has gone from a grumbling Jeremiah to a man dealing in irrefutable truths.Instead, the differences are largely down to structure and melody. Ill Wind has a beautiful tune floating over the song’s jazzy changes. By contrast, Anima’s nine tracks were constructed by Yorke sending sprawling electronic jams to producer Nigel Godrich, who edited them down.Fans might note that this process is not dissimilar to the one used to make Amok, the solitary album by Yorke’s side project Atoms for Peace, and, as with Amok, you can tell. There’s a preponderance of dance rhythms – post-dubstep beats and bass behind Traffic’s massed samples of Yorke discordantly harmonising, two-step garage periodically galvanising the meandering Runawayaway, whispers of drum’n’bass breakbeat on Twist. And yet there’s very little of dance music’s propulsive dynamics. The songs tend to settle on one point and stay there, layering on intriguing sounds without moving forward.Sometimes this works. Last I Heard (He Was Circling Down the Drain) becomes an oddly tense experience as it appears to build up to a climax that never comes. Sometimes it makes tracks seem scrappy and underdone: Not the News clatters to a halt just as it appears to be getting started. The Axe’s repetition of “I thought we had a deal” is the closest Anima comes to anything as vulgar and crowdpleasing as a hook or a chorus – for the most part the melodies feel fragmentary and vaporous.That said, Anima packs plenty of nice moments into its nine tracks – among them the point midway through Twist where it appears to become a different song entirely, its fidgety agitation giving way to something both calmer and more eerie, linked to the first part by only the slenderest musical threads. The music on Dawn Chorus, meanwhile, is almost as lovely as the real thing – lovely enough to make you wish it was topped with something other than a monotonal sprechgesang vocal. The bassline on I Am a Very Rude Person is a fantastic, serpentine thing. Moreover, from its title down, it offers evidence of Yorke’s sense of humour. “I’m breaking out the turntables, now I’m going to watch your party die,” he sings, neatly surmising his fabled DJing appearance on the web series Boiler Room, where he seemed to be enjoying his own selections considerably more than anyone else in the club.There are clever sounds and intriguing samples: the muted double bass that underpins The Axe, the mass of chaotic orchestration that briefly overpowers Not the News, the dubby bassline of Impossible Knots. Among the extraneous stuff accompanying its release, the fact that Anima’s deluxe vinyl edition comes hardback-bound seems fitting. This feels like a glimpse through an artist’s sketchbook, interesting rather than essential.Burial – ClaustroBreakneck UK garage recast as something simultaneously floor-filling and eerie – its female vocals and poppy hook set amid crackle, distortion and unexpectedly ominous chords."
Spider-Man: Far from Home review – post-Endgame outing lacks Marvel sparkle,"Tom Holland swings into Europe on a school trip that sees Prague under attack, Italy in danger – and Jake Gyllenhaal wearing a very weird helmet",3,"Well, not too far from home. In fact, we are on pretty familiar ground, despite Spider-Man now going on a hormonally charged school trip to Venice, Prague and other European cities whose national governments have given this film tax breaks.For all these exotic novelties, this is a very mainstream Marvel picture, written by Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers and directed by Jon Watts, culminating in the traditional CGI damage to tourist landmarks in the time-honoured final battle-spectacular. A new character has been perfunctorily added in the form of Mysterio (Gyllenhaal) and the film is certainly nowhere near the envelope-pushingly surreal ambition of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, from last year.But Tom Holland is still very winning as Spidey, still living at home with his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) who is embarrassing him with her love life and by referring to her nephew’s spider sense as “Peter tingle”. J Jonah Jameson makes a brief, horrible return as a gruesome Alex Jones-style pundit, and Peter Parker has all sorts of dramatic new problems (it’s important to stick around for those post-credit stings).We are now in the post-Endgame, post-“blip” world where those who were disappeared have now reappeared and Peter Parker is back in high-school, hanging out with his unthreatening wingman Ned (Jacob Batalon) and romantically obsessing over MJ (Zendaya) who is being pursued by a new suitor, Brad (Remy Hii). Peter is planning to tell MJ how he feels in one of the romantic European locations they are due to visit during the upcoming break.But Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) has other plans for him: a terrifying storm-like force called an “elemental” is reducing various cities to rubble and so far the only combatant ranged against it is newcomer Quentin Beck (Gyllenhaal) from another dimension, who wears a helmet like an opaque fishbowl and whom the Italian media fatefully dub: “l’uomo del mistero”. Beck struggles mightily against the shape-shifting typhoon in Venice, causing a teen onlooker to gasp: “He’s kicking that water’s ass!” Fury needs Parker to step up and help Beck, to embrace his destiny and to justify the trust placed in him by the late Tony Stark. Is Spider-Man – that fresh-faced kid from Queens – in fact Stark’s true heir ? Those are some big iron boots to fill.The pieties these teenagers offer to the great generation of Avengers are amusingly drawn, especially the painfully earnest “in memoriam” section of the school’s TV news broadcast at the beginning: we are mischievously allowed us to think that this is going to be the film’s own dead-straight tribute to Stan Lee, before we notice the cheesy production values. Jackson, as ever, puts the ballast of maturity into the movie, needed more than ever now that Robert Downey Jr is now not in the picture. Holland is very good but he needs someone to play against, someone with Downey’s heft. That someone could well be Zendaya, as MJ, the great love of Peter Parker’s life. We shall have to see how the Marvel franchise plays this romance in forthcoming episodes. Spider-Man: Far From Home is out on 2 July in the US and UK."
The Hunt review – false accusation unleashes small-town savagery,"Almeida, LondonRupert Goold directs a taut adaptation of Thomas Vinterberg’s film about an innocent man falling prey to clannish locals",3,"Back in 2004 the Almeida had a big hit with a stage version of the film Festen. Now the theatre turns to another film from the same Danish director, Thomas Vinterberg, which also deals with sexual abuse. The main difference is that the accusation against Lucas, a teacher at an infant school, is in this case unjust. While David Farr’s adaptation and Rupert Goold’s production make rigorous viewing, I miss the sense of quotidian reality that gave the movie much of its power.In the film we see the vindictive isolation of Lucas after the six-year-old Clara falsely claims that he had exposed himself to her: even the local shopkeeper refuses to serve him food. The stage version feels more like a savage ritual. Great stress is laid on the drunken clannishness of the local men and Es Devlin’s design is dominated by a rotating house through whose transparent walls we frequently glimpse an antlered deer. The point is clear: this is a hunting community and Lucas has become the prey. Farr also spells out more explicitly than in the film the guilt of Clara’s parents, whose abrasive quarrels compel her to seek comfort from her teacher.It is all staged with skilful economy by Goold. At one point the house becomes a church teeming with Christmas worshippers. Tobias Menzies, with his taut features, admirably conveys the element of reserve in Lucas that both attracts the equally withdrawn Clara and makes him a natural target for the town’s bully boys. Justin Salinger and Poppy Miller as the girl’s parents vividly portray a couple torn between their long-term attachment to Lucas and refusal to believe their daughter is lying. Taya Tower – one of three children alternating as Clara – has an extraordinary rapt solemnity and Stuart Campbell impresses as Lucas’s loyal son. In its depiction of the way a false accusation can spread like a virus, the play is undeniably chilling. But although Farr’s script is subtly different from the original screenplay by Vinterberg and Tobias Lindholm, I still feel this is a piece that works best through the detailed literalness of cinema.The Hunt is at the Almeida theatre, London, until 3 August"
Hero review – biopic of a world-changing Trinidadian war hero,"A thought-provoking drama-documentary about Ulric Cross, an RAF pilot and diplomat who was a go-between in several African countries’ independence struggles",3,"Released to coincide with Windrush Day, this engaged drama-documentary pays tribute to Ulric Cross, the Trinidadian who became the most decorated of the RAF’s West Indian recruits during the second world war; he later became a producer-presenter with the BBC, then a go-between in several African countries’ struggles against imperialism.From the off, writer-director Frances-Anne Solomon strikes a wistful note, wavering between celebration of an extraordinary existence and regret around the aims unachieved in that lifetime. Footage of the actual, ailing Cross prompts daughter Nicola to remark that, to winkle these details out, “it’s just so silly that it takes some dying”. As Britain re-examines where it stands in relation to the Windrush arrivals, it is timely viewing, to say the least, though it finally offers an even bigger picture than that suggests.Solomon’s reconstructions raise complicated questions of identity that a better furnished period drama might stifle among its scatter cushions. An RAF application form prompts reflection on whether Caribbean fliers felt more African or European in their outlook. In postwar London, Cross (played by the quietly commanding Nickolai Salcedo) lives a dual life, meeting with such thinkers as CLR James and George Padmore, yet hiding their words from his white British sweetheart Anna (Pippa Nixon). He makes for an atypical biopic subject: more analyst than man of action. Evidently, Cross saw Britain backsliding into complacency after vanquishing the Nazis; a further tragedy is how Africa, which Cross viewed as a possible promised land, came to be riven with murderous uncertainty.Those African travels – encompassing a plot to smuggle Padmore’s papers out of Ghana – allows Hero to flirt with commercial thriller territory, but it is largely a film of meetings and discussions, intuiting that backroom talk is what most often alters the course of our lives. Solomon’s clever marshalling of archive footage gives it scope, repositioning Cross in the middle of a monochrome world only reluctantly converting to Kodachrome and Technicolor. Inevitably we see Lord Kitchener, cuddly enough to be integrated into the Paddington universe. More shameful is the unveiling of a “Keep Britain White” banner in Trafalgar Square, forcing the protagonist into a decision presumably now facing many foreign nationals. The film gets episodic late on, yet remains stimulating and provocative – filmed history that means to prompt debate, rather than light matinee snoozing."
Child's Play review – a razor-sharp and exquisitely gruesome toy story,The knife-wielding Chucky doll is updated for the digital era in a horror reboot that shrewdly skewers western consumerism,4,"To paraphrase Cliff Richard, we have once again got ourselves a cryin’, talkin’, sleepin’, walkin’, increasin’ly disturbin’, menacin’, stabbin’, terrifyin’, livin’ doll. (Cliff went on to say of his own partner that he was “gonna lock her up in a trunk so no big hunk can steal her away”, so he may qualify for horror-film status on his own.)The satanic toy Chucky is back in an entertaining reboot of the horror franchise, written by Tyler Burton Smith and directed by newcomer Lars Klevberg, a Norwegian film-maker who has another scary movie out this year called Polaroid, about a possessed camera.Chucky is voiced by Mark Hamill (with one flippant reference to Han Solo) and our squat, troll-haired antihero is something of a cousin to Ted, the dishevelled and potty-mouthed teddy bear that reclaimed Mark Wahlberg’s attention during his midlife crisis in the Seth MacFarlane comedy. This reboot is reconfigured around something more overtly and satirically absurd than usual: it is a movie that mocks the exploitative globalised conditions in which toys are made for complacent consumers in the prosperous west. It makes fun of our infantilised dependence on tech, and there is a very funny gag about Tupac.Aubrey Plaza plays Karen, a single mom who works at a huge toy store. Her son Andy (Gabriel Bateman) is a lonely kid who is hearing-impaired and gets bullied. They have a nice neighbour, Doreen (Carlease Burke) who is regularly visited by her son Mike (Brian Tyree Henry), a cop.At work, Karen has to deal with people disappointed with a new creepy “boy” doll called Buddi, which can be programmed to speak spontaneously; his body-camera can record content to be uploaded to the TV, and his face-recognition software makes Buddi puppyishly loyal to his owner.One particular Buddi doll has had to be taken back because it is behaving oddly; this is because the brutalised factory worker at a Vietnam sweatshop deliberately removed the “appropriate language” filters. So Karen brings him home to give to Andy – and Buddi weirdly starts referring to himself as “Chucky” and takes against Karen’s new red-haired boyfriend.At first, some cool kids like Chucky – and like Andy too – because Chucky swears. But then gruesome violence ensues. And Andy is still bullied because of his hearing aid, which whistles with feedback like the old-fashioned analogue device it is, obsolete compared to the state-of-the-art digital toy. Andy is the one who feels faulty.Chucky reminds me of the sinister ventriloquist dummy from Dead of Night but without the ventriloquist. Or perhaps the consumer himself is the impotent ventriloquist, the kid who is encouraged to identify utterly with an uncanny anthropomorphic toy whose purpose is to get you to buy more stuff. Child’s Play bubbles with entertaining bad taste."
Ordinary Time review – quietly profound joys of bringing up baby,"A couple navigate the first few weeks of parenthood in Susana Nobre’s affecting, meditative drama",3,"Perhaps drawing its title from the term for the periods between major Christian festivals, this short but gracefully composed Franco-Portuguese film emanates something faintly metaphysical in its portrayal of the first few weeks in the lives of a new mother, father and baby in Lisbon. It consists of almost nothing: conversations about similar child-rearing experiences with friends and family, a trip to the countryside, painterly shots of the mum zonked out in plastic gloves on the sofa, lactation leaking out into her blouse. But, of course, this stuff is everything: ecce homo.Director Susana Nobre, a documentarian making her fiction debut, mines this universality in the gap between the two forms. The exchanges – a friend explaining why having children isn’t for him, another moaning about her nightmare before-school routine with her daughter, a grandparent remembering brutal childbirth of yore – are presented matter-of-fact, as if overheard. But scripted and shot with a deliberate, unwavering calm reminiscent – especially in the framing shots of Lisbon housing – of that cinematic saint Yasujirō Ozu, they quickly build a meditative power; a scrapbook redolent of human experience, parallel to the one another grandparent shows off of his European travels.Ordinary Time does briefly dally in the kind of obvious territory you might expect from a Hollywood comedy on the same subject: the couple bicker about who should be doing the childcare. Near the end, a friend’s daughter hacks out an approximation on her violin of the comic-melancholy air that opened the film. Perhaps Nobre, in this quietly profound film, is saying: we’re all just unfinished work, muddling through."
Mari review –  Georgia Parris' stirring drama about a pregnant dancer,"Bobbi Jene Smith is excellent as a dancer attempting to reconcile motherhood, performance and family in this promising indie film",4,"The latest triumph from Film London’s Microwave scheme – the BFI and BBC Films programme that has produced such worthwhile investments as Hong Khaou’s Lilting and Eran Creevy’s Shifty – is an engrossing close study of a thirtysomething woman caught between two worlds, and two states of being.American choreographer Bobbi Jene Smith plays Charlotte, a principal in a contemporary dance troupe whose preparations for a major show are dealt two blows in quick succession. First comes a positive pregnancy test, and the realisation the body with which she so forcefully expresses herself will undergo radical change. Second, there’s a call from her family, gathering round the hospital bed of her dying grandmother. A rehearsal-room prologue has already established Charlotte’s remarkable physical flexibility; what follows is a test of mental and emotional adaptability.Writer-director Georgia Parris’s interest lies in those tensions that exist in certain bohemian-leaning families, rarely addressed head-on, yet always present (Joanna Hogg appears to be one influence here). Judicious enough to present us with both sides of this situation, the film-maker casts supremely sympathetic performers – Phoebe Nicholls and Madeleine Worrall – as Charlotte’s mother and sister, striving to hold their clan together while insisting that, whatever else they are, dance recitals aren’t quite life and death. Smith herself keeps shifting our responses, much as Charlotte pushes and pulls her troupe. This performer’s nervous vibration makes her solo scenes more immediately compelling than the hospital interactions, yet we understand how her relentless intensity might well drive mum and sis to look for jolly llama memes.A few scenes around the grandmother’s cottage risk slipping into the same airlessness that dogs Hogg’s work; light and space comes naturally with a bigger budget. Nevertheless, Parris is way ahead of the game in her framing choices and sound design, and stirringly adventurous in her incorporation of dance into the rigid, humdrum everyday. One dream sequence ranks among the boldest imaginative leaps in recent British cinema, and there’s something very smart in the use of a floor exercise to comment on the drama of a self-sufficient woman having to feel her way through the business of dependency.If you enjoyed Madeline’s Madeline despite its indie quirks, Parris’s carefully weighted debut may prove just the left-field ticket: there’s a lot of promise here, along with a startling level of achievement."
The Chills review – Martin Phillipps' triumph and tragedy told with extraordinary candour,"While shooting the documentary, the frontman was told he had a 31% chance of dying within a year. He allows the film-makers in every step of the way",5,"The independent scene that emerged from Dunedin, New Zealand, in the early 1980s had all the strange qualities musical trainspotters around the world associate with isolation. Hamish Kilgour from the Clean describes the city as a cauldron, with the low-hanging sky its lid. It’s a creative pressure cooker from which artists must escape.In the decades since, the bands that steamed from the top of that cauldron have gone global. Next to the Clean, the biggest name is Martin Phillipps, the legendary leader – of 21 different lineups – of the Chills. They were the definitive Dunedin band, with a strange, light, airy, eerie, breezy magic that both matched the city’s geography and transcended it.But they were cursed. The subtitle of The Chills: The Triumph and Tragedy of Martin Phillipps – a new documentary by Julia Parnell and Rob Curry – tells you that this is, first and foremost, a portrait of the artist. A consummate songwriter, Phillipps appears as both a driven man and a lost boy, emotionally cut off from those drawn into his orbit to help him realise his vision.The film opens in the interior of Phillipps’ home. Over the haunted opening notes of Pink Frost (“That’s fine art, according to me,” we hear Iggy Pop say, on a radio show), Phillipps pulls out his keyboard – then breaks into Heavenly Pop Hit, which wasn’t so much his biggest hit as his nearest miss.Spliced amid scenes of festival crowds, ecstatic gigs and the video clip of the song, Phillipps climbs into a decrepit car and drives himself to hospital to receive the results of his liver function tests. Phillipps has hepatitis C. He is told, with medical precision, that he has a 31% chance of dying within 12 months.Then he is given a guarantee: “If you do keep drinking, Martin, you will die,” the physician says.There is so much about the Chills’ story that is, on the face of it, cliched. After a number of acclaimed singles and EPs, Phillipps, whose best songs are touched with a sense of wonder, signs his band to a multi-album deal with a US label, Slash. When the hits fail to materialise, he sinks into a fog of heroin addiction, alcoholism, depression and withdrawal.But Parnell and Curry treat their subject with unusual sensitivity, helped by Phillipps’ extraordinary candour. He allows them access to every step of his treatment process, as well as to his archives (he is an obsessive collector). Around him, other band members, each of them individually numbered, step forward to speak.What they have to say is just as unfiltered. The former drummer Caroline Easther (Chill No 12) says Phillipps made her feel anxious. The bassist Justin Harwood (Chill No 14) comments that he didn’t know if he was needed or expendable. He came to the latter conclusion after Phillipps told him he planned to write the bass parts on the band’s next album himself.Another bassist, Terry Moore (No 6), who played in two stints with the band, wonders if he’s going to be next. The drummer Jimmy Stephenson (No 15) has been left traumatised. In tears, he pulls out a gold record of the band’s biggest album, Submarine Bells, the glass cracked after falling off his wall in an earthquake: to him it’s symbol of both “great success and shattered dreams”.In between, we watch Phillipps going through piles of junk as he reassesses his life, sorting the detritus from the essentials. Preparing for an art exhibition – while spray-painting a mummified cat – he muses that “it’s much more fun working as a team on anything. But I’m not going to sacrifice the quality for just a bit of team spirit.” Phillipps remained Chill No 1.Over it all, Dunedin hovers. “The black cloud rolled in and it was there for a good long stay,” says Chill No 26, Phil Kusabs. He’s speaking of Phillipps but he may as well be talking about the city, for its combination of suburban blandness and gothic grandeur. We see trees bent out of shape by the elements and the forest in which Pink Frost was shot behind the town.It’s beautifully filmed, suffusing the documentary with an atmosphere to match the Chills’ glorious music, and we get to hear much of that, too. But it’s never allowed to get in the way of the story – there’s no recounting of the band’s discography and, other than Neil Finn and the aforementioned Iggy Pop, no higher luminaries are called on to affirm the band’s standing.Phillipps’ story resonates because despite his self-involvement, it’s bigger than he is. It’s about artistic integrity, self-realisation, self-acceptance and a reflection on mortality. Towards the end of this sad, lovely film, the emotional rush is equivalent to the Dunedin surf washing on to the cold beaches – it finishes far more optimistically than it promises to.As a fan, I wanted to punch the air. And of course, it will be fans of the Chills who queue up first to see this documentary.

Toy Story 4 review – new characters but the same old Story,"It may only be a repeat of earlier ideas and plotlines, but compare it to the fourth films in other franchises and Pixar’s latest is an amusing and charming gem",3,"Having done so many things unimaginably better than so many other movie franchises, it’s fitting that the Toy Story series now gives us a classier, superior kind of anticlimax.Compared to many fourquels we’ve had in the past – Jaws IV: The Revenge; Superman IV: The Quest for Peace; Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol – Toy Story 4 is in a different league. And if you’d never seen any other of the Toy Stories, you’d probably think this one – written by Pixar veteran Andrew Stanton with Stephany Folsom and directed by Josh Cooley – was a gem. It is sprightly, sweet-natured and gorgeous to look at (and how blase we’ve all become about animation standards that 10 years ago had us hyperventilating with astonishment). There are some nice lines and a nifty allusion to Hitchcock’s Strangers on a Train. But this movie is fundamentally repeating itself: repeating characters, ideas and plotlines – even if it does it with buoyancy and charm.The last two Toy Stories heartwrenchingly tackled the idea of obsolescence. How do toys feel when they are not wanted, and get thrown away? Before I became a father myself, I naively thought these themes reflected the child’s fear of abandonment by the parents. After my son was born, the truth hit me like a blinding light: it is the opposite way around. It is the parents who fear that moment when their child doesn’t want to play with them any more. In Toy Story 3, Woody, Buzz and the gang are shipped off to a community centre that is chillingly like an old folks home and is run by abusive inmates; there is redemption when they are given to a new kid called Bonnie.And basically Toy Story 4 starts the same story all over again. Same deal, new kid, though a flashback adroitly stitches a new backstory into the drama: there is some history between Woody and a certain other member of the cast. And we also meet a new toy: when Bonnie has to go off for her first day in nursery school, Woody sneaks into her backpack to keep an eye on her, and witnesses little Bonnie make a crude toy out of a plastic fork that she calls “Forky” and brings home. Inevitably, poor Forky (voiced by Tony Hale) gets lost in a certain antique store when the family goes on a road trip, and Woody and the gang have to rescue him. They encounter new characters: a creepy doll called Gabby Gabby (Christina Hendricks) with sinister assistants and shades of the terrifying Lots-o’-Huggin Bear in Toy Story 3. There is a funny new duo, Bunny and Duckie (Jordan Peele and Keegan-Michael Key) and a very amusing Canadian stunt motorbike rider, Duke Caboom (Keanu Reeves).Forky is potentially a very interesting character. All the other toys are created by corporations, but what happens when a toy is actually made by the kid? Is there a primeval, even incestuous link between creator and created? Well, no, not really. However unevolved, Forky plays by the same rules as everyone else.It is absurd to start complaining about implausibility in a film about magic toys, but for the first time I sensed a kind of evasion or even dishonesty in the Toy Story franchise. For this fourth film, they have decided to hit the reset button and simply restart the situation with a new kid – not Andy but Bonnie. Fine. But after more than a decade’s worth of use, these toys should be grimy and falling to pieces. Their actual demise as objects would be a real issue. Yet Woody et al look as fresh as daisies; as fresh as new toys. It is ridiculous to worry about this, of course, and yet Toy Story 2 was specifically about how toys might want to achieve immortality as collectables, the Faustian bargain of preserving their pristine quality under cellophane at the cost of not getting real, hands-on love from kids. Their mortality as objects was a real issue that has been sidestepped here.Toy Story 4 also joins the X-Men and the Men In Black in trying to achieve a bit more gender balance, and this is something it does with artless persuasiveness and an implication that it isn’t just the kids who are growing up, it’s the toys themselves. I’m happy to see it happen. Toy Story 4 isn’t at all bad. But it’s time to let go."
Shaft review – regressive sequel swaps out style for ugly homophobia,Samuel L Jackson returns in the latest take on the 70s detective to unleash a toxic stream of bigotry in a misjudged attack on millennial masculinity,1,"How do you update Shaft for the modern era? John Singleton tried in 2000 with a serviceable if unspectacular sequel, a rather asexual and anonymous follow-up to the far more stylish and distinctive original. Almost two decades later and somehow we’re even further from the right answer. Because it turns out that a 2019 version of Shaft probably shouldn’t turn into an unabashed celebration of regressively misogynistic and homophobic masculinity. In Ride Along director Tim Story’s wildly misjudged follow-up, we’re given a Jordan Peterson-level assault on so-called beta millennial males, a strange, angry attack on modernity that feels like the result of a group of bitter men griping about the metrosexualisation of a younger generation.In the latest incarnation, the younger Shaft, played by the undeniably charming Jessie T Usher, is a decaf coffee-drinking, gun-hating, women-respecting data analyst for the FBI, which turns him into a joke and a punchline for both the film and his absentee father. Played by a returning Samuel L Jackson, he’s disgusted to see what his son has turned into at the hands of his mother (a wasted Regina Hall), who raised him in his absence. Convinced he must be gay, he’s determined to turn him into his idea of a real man as the pair investigate the death of younger Shaft’s ex-junkie friend. There’s an inevitable culture clash between the two but elder Shaft is focused on showing his son that listening less to women and shooting more guns will help to show him the way.There’s a smart, self-aware film to be made from a rough kernel of this setup. Focusing on the different definitions of masculinity shared by two generations of men is an intriguing entry point, especially given that one is a father who hasn’t been present for his son’s youth. There’s space for suggesting a happy medium between two extremities but Story’s update has zero interest in nuance or even debate. We’re shown time and time again that for the younger Shaft, the more he embraces modern, “softer” qualities, the less of a man he then is. Skinny jeans, coconut water, desk work – all treated with unbridled disdain as for his father they all symbolise femininity or, even worse, homosexuality. The film is littered with uneasy jabs not just towards gay men but also the trans community (young Shaft’s boss complains that his biggest problem is that his daughter “wants to be known as Frank”). “You sure you like pussy?” is repeated by a concerned Jackson with such alarming frequency that I was tempted to ask the critic next to me whether we had somehow been magically transported back to the 70s.But even in the 1971 original, sexual and gender politics were far less troubling. Back then, Shaft even had a gay friend of sorts, a barman who he treated as his equal, but somehow almost 20 years later, every reference to homosexuality is dripping in bile. While 70s Shaft might have been dismissive about the women he was having sex with, he didn’t feel the need to pause the film to give a sermon about how all women desperately want and need to be treated with unquestioned strength and power, something that the modern incarnation deems necessary. It would be one thing if the film presented him as a dinosaur but the script, from Black-ish creator and Girls Trip co-writer Kenya Barris and Family Guy’s Alex Barnow, is too busy hero-worshipping him to bother finding fault.The film presents us with two outwardly strong female characters, in Hall and younger Shaft’s love interest, played by Love, Simon’s Alexandra Shipp, but any feistiness is soon overruled by their visible arousal at men being men. In one of the film’s strangest scenes, younger gun-hating Shaft is forced into a shootout as his date watches smiling, turned on by his blood thirst. Similarly Hall’s date with a beta male (who’s treated with contempt for having manners and being scared by another shootout) is interrupted by a swaggering Jackson, the man who abandoned her with a baby, making her quiver by showing off the two women he has arrived with and embarrassing her date.Even outside of the script’s aggressively repetitive bigotry, the shambolic Scooby Doo plot struggles to grab even the slightest amount of attention. There are half-assed attempts to modernise a familiar narrative with references to an Islamic church and men suffering from PTSD but it soon devolves into dull, by-the-numbers, jarringly over-sentimental sitcom. When action arrives it’s also haphazardly choreographed, especially in a shoddy, confusingly shot finale. Jackson shamelessly showboats throughout but his charisma is buried underneath a shtick that becomes so gratingly obnoxious I almost applauded when Richard Roundtree’s original Shaft made his inevitable cameo. But rather than saving the day, he’s given little to do, and the script chooses to defend both admittedly terrible absentee fathers while throwing Hall’s beleaguered single mother under the bus for feminising her son. It’s frustrating to see such an underrated comic actor like Hall struggle to find space to shine, although she does provide one of the film’s rare funny moments as she talks to herself in a public bathroom. Usher similarly, who was so good in the now cancelled TV comedy Survivor’s Remorse, does his best with a crudely etched character, but any resistance against the film’s regressive politics is ultimately futile.The mission in Shaft is to break down a modern definition of masculinity, to toughen up “delicate” qualities, such as hating guns and listening to women, and return to the good old days instead. While Jackson’s ribald relic might succeed in forcing his son back to the past, this embarrassingly tone-deaf film fails to take us with him.Shaft is out in the US on 14 June and will be available in other countries on Netflix from 28 June"
Five Seasons: The Gardens of Piet Oudolf review – art of a Dutch master,This intriguing doc details the maverick landscape gardener’s visions in all their florid glory,4,"Piet Oudolf is the 74-year-old Dutch landscape gardener who made his name by designing New York’s High Line project in 2006, in which a derelict viaduct section of the railroad in the west of Manhattan, abandoned since 1980, was repurposed as a brilliant rus in urbe adventure: an overhead urban quasi-wilderness that became one of the city’s biggest attractions.Oudolf is an intriguing figure, a gardener who prizes not flowers or decorative features or even colour but the muscularforms and textures of plants and grasses. His gardens are so fascinating that they almost assume the status of abstract art (although this is not an idea closely examined in this documentary) and they could be described as site-specific installations where the garden itself is the site. He also designed the Battery Gardens in New York and the Lurie Garden in Chicago, as well as various projects in Europe – although my one tiny quarrel with this film is that there is nothing about his Millennium Garden in Norfolk’s Pensthorpe Nature Reserve, once the home of BBC’s Springwatch.“Plants are characters I compose with and I put them on the stage,” he says at one stage, and at another: “There are too many flowers. I long for their decay, when they turn to skeletons.” There is something almost Uncle Monty-ish about Oudolf at times, despising mere floral beauty."
I Am Mother review – all-female Netflix thriller is a solid sci-fi watch,"Newcomer Clara Rugaard impresses as a girl raised by a robot who finds her life thrown into question when an invader, played by Hilary Swank, arrives",3,"There are a lot of familiar echoes throughout the Australian-American sci-fi thriller I Am Mother, a film that patchworks tropes and ideas from elsewhere but just about crafts something worthwhile in the process. Lines can be drawn from 10 Cloverfield Lane to Moon to Retreat to Black Mirror to Chappie to Ex Machina to any one of the Terminator entries, each acting as a reminder of a mostly superior genre lineage, quite often to the film’s detriment.The script, from first-time writer Michael Lloyd Green, places us in a sleek “repopulation facility” after an extinction event has taken place in the outside world. An android called Mother, voiced by Rose Byrne, has access to a collection of 63,000 human embryos and one day, she decides to grant life to one of them, birthing a child known as Daughter. She’s raised with the knowledge that life is to be lived within these four walls, her Mother acting as parent, teacher and caregiver. The two share a warm relationship but as she grows up, Daughter, played by newcomer Clara Rugaard, can’t shake her curiosity over what else might exist and when an unexpected visitor, played by Hilary Swank, arrives, their safe home is suddenly in jeopardy.Swank’s character, never named in the film and simply referred to as Woman in the credits, has a very different story to tell Daughter, informing her that androids aren’t to be trusted and that any chaos outside is a direct result of them trying to overthrow humanity. The majority of the film unfolds like a one-location stage play with two women trying to convince a young girl that the other one isn’t to be trusted. As a viewer, we’re also trying to figure out who or what to believe and there is some fun to be had playing detective. But Lloyd Green isn’t adept enough at scattering the clues, with a string of reveals making us pretty certain of one eventuality early on.There’s intrigue along the way but somehow suspense is a tougher ask. Despite an almost two-hour running time, first-time director Grant Sputore does maintain a steady pace, ensuring things never flag, but he’s not really able to raise the heart-rate enough to excite. Tonally, his film shifts between thoughtful parable to action thriller and I’d have preferred more of the former because the film works best when it’s wrestling with knotty ideas. The very concept of whether an android can successfully raise a child is fascinating in itself and the film toys with ideas of how this would affect development and what expectations and motivations would guide such parenting. There are nice touches along the way, such as Daughter’s slightly robotic behaviour in certain instances and Mother’s attempts to be seen as both warm and maternal while also maintaining order.Key to the success of the character of Mother is Byrne, who modulates the soft and the sinister so well that we can almost immediately understand a difficult connection. There’s also strong work from a confident Rugaard, channeling a young Natalie Portman, although the film slips up as her character progresses. She’s been raised by a robot, without any other human or animal for company (just some unexplained old clips of The Tonight Show) yet as her world expands, there’s not quite enough shock or wonder to make us believe that she’s experiencing profound events for the first time. Swank, an actor who excels when accentuating strength and resilience yet often stumbles when required to do much else, is mostly effective, offering up a grizzled Linda Hamilton-lite performance as a woman who may or may not be trustworthy.Acquired by Netflix after a muted Sundance premiere, it’s a film that still ambitiously aims to be viewed alongside its bigger-budgeted, big-screen sci-fi peers and Sputore, along with production designer Hugh Bateup, does an admirable job at convincing us that we’re watching something on a far grander scale. It’s the sort of slick, splashy debut that should have Hollywood execs scrambling to work with him and I expect to see his name linked to a high-profile project within months. I Am Mother is undoubtedly a strong calling card with plenty on its mind. I just wish it had figured out what to do with it all.I Am Mother is now available on Netflix"
"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert review – riotous return trip","In this smart, lovable gem, now rereleased, a trans woman and two drag queens kick up the dust in Australia’s outback",5,"Terence Stamp had his finest hour with this movie, which incidentally allowed me to “get” Terence Stamp, while at the same wondering – as he deadpanned his role alongside Hugo Weaving and Guy Pearce squeezing every last outrageous drop from theirs – whether Stamp completely “got” what was happening himself.In 1994, writer-director Stephan Elliott created a pioneering LGBT gem with this funny, smart and intensely lovable road-trip comedy – an anti-Crocodile Dundee. It’s about Tick (Weaving) and Adam (Pearce), Australian drag-queen short of cash who journey from Sydney to Alice Springs where Tick’s estranged straight wife, Marion (Sarah Chadwick), has got them a gig performing in a hotel lounge. This they do in a converted bus that they rename Priscilla and have to repaint, to cover the homophobic graffiti people have been spraying on it. But they must also do in the company of Bernadette, startlingly played by Stamp, a trans woman and artiste who has just been widowed and needs a new life direction.Our quarrelling trio set off and encounter all sorts of hilarious problems along the way, their only friends and allies being some amused Indigenous Australians and one straight bloke, Bob, a lovely performance from veteran Australian character actor Bill Hunter, who conceives a gallant tendresse for Bernadette. As Tick, Adam and Bernadette surreally show off their exuberant costumes in the middle of the remote Northern Territory, the film starts to resemble a challenging piece of site-specific installation art. This being 1994, Abba are respectfully invoked.Pearce is lithe, queeny and very buff as Adam, snaking into a local video store and asking for The Texas Chainsaw Mascara, and there are some cheeky gags about Prince Edward’s sexuality. It’s a tremendous film that was ahead of its time on LGBT issues and, in some ways, is ahead of ours.This review was amended on 7 June to correct the spelling of Guy Pearce’s surname."
Last Summer review – boys' own bucolic drama,Horrific tragedy strikes when a gang of youngsters go down to the woods in Jon Jones’ affecting tale of youthful heroism,3,"It would be all too easy to pigeonhole this 70s-set drama that revolves around a traumatic coming-of-age for four young boys in a bucolic setting as a Welsh Stand By Me: a handy descriptor but one that misses the point.Writer-director Jon Jones’s work has some subtlety, although it comes perilously close to the water’s edge of maudlin sentiment, and does, in fact, wet its toes, especially in the final stages. But the performances from the pre-adolescent cast are striking and powerful enough to win this some serious regard, and at the very least a place in the viewing queue for casting agents looking for young talent.In this strong ensemble Noa Thomas stands out as Davy, a kid of 13 or so who spends his long summer days hanging out with his brother Iwan (Gruffydd Weston) and two brothers from the neighbouring farm, Rhys (Rowan Jones) and Robbie (Christopher Benning). After a fine day’s exploring the woods with Rhys and Robbie’s frisky, near uncontrollable sheepdog Rex (the unimaginative name is in itself a great period detail), tickling fish and stalking a barn owl, a horrific tragedy happens out of nowhere.Jones holds tight on Thomas as Davy bears witness to the aftermath, torn between a desire to help and a sense of impotence in a suddenly much more serious, far more inexplicable world than the one he woke up in. The camerawork reflects and mimics his point of view but doesn’t overdo it.The endgame is judiciously judged. While Weston’s Iwan is a touch too optimistic, you get the sense that Jones truly understands and treasures the foolish heroism of young boys."

Godzilla: King of the Monsters review – beastly in all the wrong ways,"The tussle for power between giant monsters and humans is a timeless theme, tackled by the likes of Transformers, Jurassic Park and Pacific Rim franchises with varying degrees of success. The problem with Hollywood’s latest take, Michael Dougherty’s reimagining of the Japanese studio Toho’s famous kaiju series, is not its predictability, but its utter gracelessness.",1,"The plot picks up after 2014’s Godzilla. A sonar device developed by Vera Farmiga’s Emma to control the monsters has been hijacked by an eco-terrorist; her ex-husband (Kyle Chandler) is drafted in to track it down.Their teenage daughter (Millie Bobby Brown from Stranger Things) is a distraction, caught in the middle of her divorced parents. Battle scenes occur in weather conditions so extreme that the action is rendered indecipherable (as are the beloved giant creatures, including the three-headed serpent King Ghidorah, bird-like Rodan and winged Mothra).The ugly visual effects are outdone only by the sound design, which is relentlessly loud and thunderingly tedious. Verbal exchanges between the humans are devoid of wit and barely functional in communicating the story."
Ma review – schlock horror with Octavia Spencer,The star saves the best craziness for last in an enjoyably silly stalker thriller,3,"Octavia Spencer’s natural charisma and trustworthiness are playfully subverted in this goofy Blumhouse-produced horror thriller, directed by The Help’s Tate Taylor. Sue-Ann (Spencer) is a lonely veterinarian’s assistant who befriends a group of 16-year-olds who talk her into buying them booze at a local store. Rather than allowing them to drink and drive, she suggests they use her basement as a makeshift bar, as long as they never go upstairs. “Ma’s” soon becomes the school speakeasy. Spencer is brilliant as the dreamy, socially awkward Sue-Ann, transformed from shy social media stalker into the rambunctious life of the party, blasting out Debbie Deb’s 1984 hit Look Out Weekend. Unsurprisingly, the kids become suspicious.For about two-thirds of the film, there’s only the faintest whiff of anything truly sinister, with Taylor preferring to hint at what Ma might be hiding while refraining from gore and jump scares. Spencer mostly keeps her own craziness simmering too, until the film’s final act, at which point she is permitted to go batshit.Cameos from Allison Janney and Juliette Lewis add a sheen of prestige, but those who enjoy Blumhouse productions for their unabashed silliness will be pleased to discover a sticky slice of schlock, with both household appliances and prosthetic genitals given their genre moments."
Rory’s Way review – when Brian Cox met Rosanna Arquette,Its romantic subplot lifts this tale of a curmudgeonly crofter forced to seek medical help in the US,3,"There is a sweet love story nestled within this mild comedy drama about a grizzled Scotsman who travels to San Francisco for medical treatment and to reconnect with his adult son (JJ Feild). While on US soil, Rory MacNeil (Brian Cox – the Scottish one) is adopted by the neighbouring university’s linguists, recounting the mythology behind his favourite Gaelic words and phrases. This stubborn regard for tradition emerges at home too, as he refuses to abide with the cold modernity of his son’s US lifestyle.The film is preoccupied with Rory’s fraught family relationships (though he soon softens at the sight of his redheaded baby grandson), but I found myself more interested in the romantic subplot. Indeed, I’d have happily watched Cox flirt with Rosanna Arquette’s museum curator for 90 minutes; her game attempts to parrot his Gaelic and a tentative kiss while gardening, knee-deep in soil, are strangely charming."
Sunset review – murky Hungarian drama,László Nemes loses the plot in this story of a young woman seeking her way in the world,3,"A hat is a covering for the head; whether decorative or practical, by its very nature it obscures. Appropriate, then, that this prettified, disorienting second feature from Hungarian film-maker László Nemes (known for 2015’s Oscar-winning Son of Saul) takes place in a millinery.In Budapest, a year before the start of the first world war, 20-year-old orphan Írisz Leiter (Juli Jakab) arrives at the hat shop her parents once owned, looking for a connection to her past. Leiter’s has been taken over by the slick, bearded Oszkár Brill (Vlad Ivanov), who insists there are no positions for our behatted heroine, and so Írisz must find a family connection elsewhere. When she hears a rumour that she might have a brother named Kálmán, she sets about finding him – a trickier task than it sounds, given that he’s disappeared after supposedly (and brutally) murdering a count. Decadence, a dismembering, secret societies, not to mention the hats: on paper, the film’s plot sounds baroque, but its tone is severe.Írisz investigates a palace later invaded by anarchists, hitches rides with dodgy coachmen, finds she is nifty with an oar; her delicate features and paranoid breathlessness disguise a keen survival instinct. Her search for Kálmán is admirably dogged but increasingly difficult to follow as Nemes introduces characters without clarifying how they might relate to one another.If this withholding was a dramatic device that built to a revelation, fine, but he is more interested in creating an atmosphere of sludgy terror. This is emphasised by Mátyás Erdély’s intimate, handheld cinematography; the camera stays close to Írisz, fixing on the back of her neck and swirling around her as violence and sexual threat loom out of focus at the edge of the frame. The film’s formal qualities obscure Nemes’s intentions instead of illuminating them. It’s all too vague to function effectively as either a commentary on the build-up to the Great War or as the story of a woman looking to find her place in a city predicated on rigid, gender-determined hierarchies."
Rocketman review – Elton's sparkliest spectacle yet,"Taron Egerton is terrific as the singer, but the real star of this electric biopic is director Dexter Fletcher",5,"“When are you going to hug me?” That question echoes around Dexter Fletcher’s dazzling rock opera – a fantastical account of the highs and lows of Elton John’s wild-ride rise, told in frenetically full-blooded musical form. It’s the story of a little boy who became a big star while plaintively pleading “I want lurrve, but it’s impossible”; a shy kid (an “introverted extrovert”) who must learn to play-act confidence after enduring a childhood that would have struck a chord with Philip Larkin. Yet unlike the problematically rejigged chronology of Bohemian Rhapsody (which Fletcher rescued from disaster), this proudly nonlinear treat puts its jukebox soundtrack on shuffle, wittily deploying tunes to fit the mood rather than the timeline. The result is a riotous fact-meets-fiction swirl that combines the Brit-pic grit of That’ll Be the Day with the colourful ambition of Absolute Beginners and the surreal excesses of Lisztomania, all tied together by a barnstorming central performance from Taron Egerton.We open with Egerton’s Elton, preposterously attired in horned-demon garb, striding into rehab group therapy, where he declares himself to be an alcoholic, cocaine addict, sex addict, bulimic, shopaholic and more. From here, we flash back to key moments in Elton’s life, played out as extravagantly choreographed musical numbers – the Crocodile Rock of his blue-touch-paper appearances at the Troubadour in LA, where Elton appears to fly; the Honky Cat prowl of success with lover/manager John Reid (a slimy-sexy Richard Madden); the mournful cry of Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, as lyricist Bernie Taupin (Jamie Bell) realises they’re not in Kansas any more.It’s an audacious framing device by Billy Elliot writer Lee Hall, recalling the vaudevillian theatricality of the Ian Dury biopic Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll, which similarly cast its pop-star ringmaster as an unreliable narrator. There’s real tragicomic pathos in the sight of someone variously dressed as a queen, a fiery angel and a fluorescent bird in a gilded cage (plaudits to costume designer Julian Day) struggling to make sense of their increasingly crazy life. Throughout, Egerton (who impressively does all his own vocals) uncannily captures the blend of bare-chested bravado and rabbit-in-the-headlights terror that made Elton one of glam rock’s most intriguingly vulnerable figures.From an early snog with a 1960s soul-revue musician to a cherry-popping sex-scene played out to the strains of Take Me to the Pilot, there’s none of the coyness that won Bohemian Rhapsody a family-friendly PG-13 rating in the US. This is altogether more frank fare – and all the better for it. Yet despite the carnivalesque bustle of sex and drugs, the real centre of the drama is a low-key love story (albeit “not in that way”) between John and Taupin – two songsmiths thrown together by fate, each driven by, and dependent upon, the other. “Hand in hand went music and the rhyme” sang Elton on his autobiographical 1975 album Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy, and Fletcher’s film brilliantly recaptures that sense of creative intimacy, whether it’s Bernie talking cowboy-dreams over cups of tea, or Elton knocking out the tune for Your Song in the time it takes to have a shave. No wonder Elton’s life falls apart when Bernie decides to un-plant himself from their penthouse lifestyle and go back to his plough.Having brought gutsy oomph to the cheerfully cheesy Sunshine on Leith, actor turned director Dexter Fletcher (who debuted as an actor in Alan Parker’s Bugsy Malone) here proves himself the master of the modern screen musical. There’s breathtaking confidence in a sequence that projects young Reggie Dwight from childhood to adulthood via an exuberant fairground dance, played out to the strains of Saturday Night’s Alright (For Fighting). Later, the film dances between ambulance and amphitheatre in a manner reminiscent of Bob Fosse’s All That Jazz. I also spied the influence of Ken Russell, the director who put Elton in comically oversized bovver-boots in Tommy, and would doubtless have approved of Fletcher (whom he directed in Gothic) evoking old MGM musicals as he throws his hero into a trippy spin, climaxing with a hallucinatory human-firework sequence. Elsewhere an overhead shot of a coked-out disco orgy looks like an outtake from The Devils, interspersed with kaleidoscopic flashes of Lawrentian male wrestling.In significant supporting roles, Bryce Dallas Howard plays Elton’s mum, Sheila, torn between nurture and narcissism, and Stephen Graham is a hoot as gruff music publisher Dick James. The film’s musical director, Giles Martin, (son of George) works imaginative wonders reconfiguring Elton’s astonishing back catalogue, while production designer Marcus Rowland conjures disparate worlds through which George Richmond’s fluid cameras follow Egerton’s shining star. But for me, Fletcher is the real star of this show, a director whose enthusiasm for musical storytelling shines through every frame, hitting all the emotional high notes. I have yet to come down."
"Booksmart review – fast, funny and feminist",A dorky schoolgirl duo try out partying when they discover that studying doesn’t pay quite enough,4,"Between them, dorky best friends Molly (Beanie Feldstein) and Amy (Kaitlyn Dever) have a superiority complex. Molly is headed for Yale University, while Amy will spend the summer “in Botswana helping women make their own tampons” before attending Columbia. They have fake IDs, but only so they can get into the library, and “Malala” (as in Yousafzai) is their secret code word. The adorable, inseparable know-it-alls feel good about their choices to forgo partying for studying, until, on the eve of their high school graduation they discover that “the irresponsible people” in their class have also been accepted into Ivy League universities (except one, who’s landed a job at Google). “We chose wrong!” wails Molly, hurling a celebratory cake off a cliff in the Hollywood Hills.In Olivia Wilde’s slick, joyous directorial debut, the actor turned film-maker gives Molly and Amy a chance to prove that they’re “smart and fun” once and for all. As in Greg Mottola’s Superbad (which starred Feldstein’s older brother Jonah Hill), the film places diversions in the teens’ way as they try to make it to The Party.Both films are sweet but if that one was crass, this is clever, and self-consciously so. Booksmart’s dialogue is fast, funny and feminist, sometimes to a fault, though a surreal stop-motion animated sequence that imagines the girls as Barbie dolls (their worst nightmare) works well. Dever and Feldstein sell the pair’s charged, codependent dynamic, the former exuding a quiet confidence as the straight man to the latter’s bossy, brassy, overcompensating comedian.Wilde expertly modulates the giddy highs and bittersweet lows of being a teenager, as demonstrated in the way the film’s house party climax crests and then crashes. Wilde cuts between Molly and Amy as they flirt with their respective crushes, luring the audience into a false sense of security by registering each accidentally-on-purpose touch as a sign of encouragement. Knees knock together and then, as Perfume Genius’s Slip Away plays, stomachs drop."
Cannes 2019 week two roundup: insurrection in the air,"Tarantino stormed in with his Manson drama and Bong Joon-ho’s grifter caper was a treat, but Almodóvar stole the show",0,"Before every Cannes premiere, the cinema screen shows a live feed of the red-carpet arrivals. Early birds can sit in their seats and watch the stragglers come in. While the cameras are at pains to locate the celebrity guests, it turns out that most of the latecomers are just everyday folk. Harried film critics swinging festival bags, marauding young fans breaking into a run, a pair of old women brandishing their tickets like pistols. The atmosphere’s riotous; it’s a fun thing to see. People pour up the steps to bum-rush security, like a revolutionary rabble storming the gates to the palace.If you cover the Cannes film festival long enough, you grow accustomed to its manifold contradictions. When the schedule’s not preaching the gospel of peace and understanding via the medium of movie violence, it’s sending jewel-bedecked women tottering among the rough sleepers or promoting lean arthouse produce aboard an oligarch’s yacht. and all that. Except that this year it feels different: more alert, self-aware. The centre can’t hold and the world’s up for grabs. Something’s got to give, either on screen or off.“I say we kill the people who taught us to kill,” yells a murderous flower-child in the final reel of Quentin Tarantino’s extraordinary Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood, a film that caught the festival’s burgeoning mood of insurrection and flux even as it makes hay in late-1960s Los Angeles. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a foursquare TV star struggling to adapt to the age of Aquarius with the help of a laconic stunt double played by Brad Pitt, while Charles Manson’s disciples scurry like rats in the wings. Tarantino’s picture landed late at this festival, still warm from the editing suite, and the crowds fought to see it like a mob at the manger. It’s exultant, explosive, his most ambitious work yet – a defiant overdog drama that defends Hollywood’s old-school business model (and, by implication, the director’s own place within it) against those who’d drag it down. Be warned: the establishment dies hard in these parts.Or how about Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite, which tackles similar themes from the opposite direction and fortuitously was screened just a few hours later? It’s about a family of impoverished grifters who pass themselves off as professional servants and proceed to take over a millionaire’s South Korean home. Set-up complete, Parasite blooms into a brilliant black comedy, perfectly managed and fired by fury; the savage upstairs-downstairs satire the world needs right now. Because, hang about, who are the parasites here? The malodorous fraudsters who actually perform their respective duties with skill, or the undeserving rich with their annoying hothouse children? “It’s a chimpanzee, right?” the phoney tutor says of the mystifying kid’s daub that adorns the living-room wall. “A self-portrait,” snaps back the kid’s affronted, anxious mum.I don’t know whether Tarantino managed to catch up with Parasite (I’d love to know what he thought of it). But he did rock up at a screening of The Wild Goose Lake, a neon-drenched noir from the Chinese film-maker Diao Yinan. On reaching the auditorium, the director paused in the aisle to soak up the applause, the perfect manifestation of Cannes with his gangster suit and his seraphic smile. He looked like a Zen Buddha who runs a bookie joint on the side.Such was the heat generated by Tarantino and Bong that some other big titles risked feeling lukewarm. I couldn’t get on board with Young Ahmed, the Dardenne brothers’ earnest, fumbling attempt to project themselves into the mind of a radicalised Belgian teen, while Corneliu Porumboiu’s labyrinthine thriller The Whistlers provides terrific fun in the moment before swiftly fading from view. Terrence Malick’s A Hidden Life, by contrast, is a film to worship, not love – a beautifully mounted, deeply serious account of a conscientious objector in 1940s Austria that nonetheless remains as aloof as its subject. And then there was Frankie, from writer-director Ira Sachs, which drops a classy ensemble (Isabelle Huppert, Brendan Gleeson et al) into the Portuguese riviera and leaves them to wander, bicker and learn some important life lessons. One can see what Sachs is aiming for here – an airy, transient profundity in the manner of Eric Rohmer – but his souffle falls flat and the surfeit of cream quickly curdles and sweet death (or the credits) can’t come soon enough.Top-grade British produce was thin on the schedule this year, and so I darted around to the back of the Palais to catch Asif Kapadia’s excellent documentary Diego Maradona, which played out of competition. Kapadia delivers your classic cautionary tale, detailing the corruption of one man within a corrupt, rancid system. “Football is a game of deception,” the Argentinian player brightly explains at one point. He feints left and runs right and his enemies hack him down.Every Cannes film festival, it seems, follows its own distinct rhythm. This one initially lulled us with its loping, easy stride before quickening the pace as we rounded the bend to week two. Then all at once caution was thrown to the wind. There were great films on the schedule, discussions in pavilions and protesters on the street. And by about the second Tuesday Cannes started to feel more vital and relevant than it has done in years. If the place is a mess it’s a fascinating mess; a best-of-times festival for a worst-of-times world.Shining bright in the main lineup wass Celine Sciamma’s Portrait of a Lady on Fire, a ravishing 18th-century romance that spotlights the cloistered romance between Noémie Merlant’s portrait painter and her clenched, wary subject (superbly played by Adèle Haenel). No other film at Cannes inspired such wild devotion; few repaid our attention with this level of ardour. Sciamma lays on a soulful celebration of female solidarity and the importance of art. Hers is a film that shoots for the moon, dares to dream, even as it threatens to either collapse or explode from the force of its own surging passions.Parasite aside, though, I think my competition highlight remains Pain and Glory, Pedro Almodóvar’s elegiac, semi-autobiographical tour de force, which screened on the opening weekend and has haunted me since. Antonio Banderas gives a career-best performance as careworn Salvador Mallo, an obvious Almodóvar surrogate, looking back over his life as he contemplates the surgeon’s knife.Along the way Almodóvar gives us pain, he gives us glory; he throws in the odd wild aside. The ghosts of the past merrily rattle their chains. Skeletons take off their clothes and dance around in their bones. And yet for all its moments of antic humour, Pain and Glory stands as the warmest, saddest film this director has made; a kind of private unburdening, like the monologue on addiction that Salvador keeps saved on his PC. Amid all Cannes’s upheavals, the film provides refuge. Pain and Glory looks back, not with anger but wisdom. In its pin-sharp autumn tones, we have the sense of Almodóvar (and perhaps, by association, the festival too) coming to terms with a glowing, troubled history. It’s the chance to take stock, draw breath and move on.Political pointsTake your pick, we’ve had the lot. Climate-crisis marchers out on the Croisette, abortion-rights activists at the red carpet premiere of Juan Solanas’s crusading documentary Let It Be Law, and women’s rights protesters before an honorary award to noted French actor (and self-confessed domestic abuser) Alain Delon. The flame of Mai ‘68 still burns here in Cannes.Party gamesEvery night, a different glittering soiree. Every night, the same select group of A-listers. Elle Fanning, Robert Pattinson and, um, Eva Longoria were on heavy rotation, while Mariah Carey treated guests to performances at both the Amfar fundraiser and the Chopard bash. Carey’s stylists reportedly paused the latter recital for a hasty pit-stop – powdering madame’s nose and buffing her diamond wrist bangle.Shock horror, no scandalThe only thing missing from this year’s edition was a bona-fide film scandal, tossed into the crowd like a firework or a stink-bomb. True, Gaspar Noé swung by with his piece of (excuse the technical term) stroboscopic bollocks, but his Lux Aeterna more fizzled than sparked. Those craving a rush moored up at The Lighthouse, a demented dark-and-stormy night yarn, performed with drunk abandon by Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe. Rocked by expressionistic black-and-white imagery, pitching towards madness, Robert Eggers’s film was Cannes’s copper-bottomed classic from far out of left-field."
Sibyl review – silly comedy about a psychotherapist breaking all the rules,Justine Triet makes her Cannes competition debut with this unconvincing film about an alcoholic therapist who mines a patient’s life for drama,2,"Some movies find themselves wading up to their thighs in a treacle-lake of their own pointlessness. One such is Sibyl, directed and co-written by French film-maker Justine Triet, making her Cannes competition debut. It is a muddled, silly comedy-drama starring Virginie Efira as a psychotherapist ironically named Sibyl (no one could be less like the fabled ancient Greek soothsayer).Ten years previously, Sibyl was a bestselling author who went for a big career change for personal reasons: she had a painful breakup with her partner Gabriel (Niels Schneider), with whom she has a child. Now she is reasonably happy with a new partner, Etienne (Paul Hamy), though she still struggles with alcohol addiction. She has had another child but is yearning to return to her literary vocation. One of her patients has a fascinating, troubling personal life which may cure her writer’s block. Margot (Adèle Exarchopoulos) is a movie actor having an affair with her co-star, Igor (Gaspard Ulliel). She is pregnant with his child, but he is in a relationship with their director Mika (played by Sandra Hüller, from Maren Ade’s Toni Erdmann). They are incidentally shooting their film on the island of Stromboli, perhaps as a homage to Roberto Rossellini and Ingrid Bergman.Against all the therapy rules, Sibyl starts covertly recording their conversations to use as raw material for fiction, and then has a compulsion to intervene in Margot’s life, trying to shape it like an omniscient narrator. And, of course, Margot’s pregnancy has a painful personal resonance.Almost any of the constituent parts of this set-up could work as the basis of a movie. The idea of a shrink secretly converting her patient’s life into fiction is certainly promising. But the film’s focus is hopelessly split among all the other things going on. Sibyl’s backstory is frankly overblown, unconvincing and uninteresting – although Laure Calamy (from the Netflix French TV hit Call My Agent) has a funny cameo as Sibyl’s sharp-tongued sister, who gives her kid a tutorial in emotional manipulation. All the tautness and tension that is needed for the main Margot/Igor/Mika/Sibyl story is dissipated with other stuff - and even the main story is complicated by Mika, who is not a very well-written character – and sadly Hüller is not especially good in the part.Fundamentally, Sibyl is not funny because it is not convincing, and some of the acting is not of the highest order. Efira’s “drunk” turn is something she may wish to omit from her showreel. Sibyl screened at the Cannes film festival. This article was amended on 2 February 2022 to correct spelling of the film’s name and character, previously given as “Sybil”."
Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood review - Tarantino's dazzling LA redemption song,"With Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt playing a TV actor and stuntman who cross paths with the Manson cult, Tarantino has created outrageous, disorienting entertainment",5,"Quentin Tarantino’s exploitation black-comedy thriller Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood finds a pulp-fictionally redemptive take on the Manson nightmare in late-60s California: a B-movie loser’s state of grace.It’s shocking, gripping, dazzlingly shot in the celluloid-primary colours of sky blue and sunset gold: colours with the warmth that Mama Cass sang about. The Los Angeles of 1969 is recovered with all Tarantino’s habitual intensity and delirious, hysterical connoisseurship of pop culture detail. But there’s something new here: not just erotic cinephilia, but TV-philia, an intense awareness of the small screen background to everyone’s lives. Opinions are going to divide about this film’s startling and spectacularly provocative ending, which Tarantino is concerned to keep secret and which I have no intention of revealing here. But certainly any ostensible error of taste is nothing like, say, those in the much admired Inglourious Basterds. And maybe worrying about taste is to miss the point of this bizarre Jacobean horror fantasy.Quite simply, I just defy anyone with red blood in their veins not to respond to the crazy bravura of Tarantino’s film-making, not to be bounced around the auditorium at the moment-by-moment enjoyment that this movie delivers – and conversely, of course, to shudder at the horror and cruelty and its hallucinatory aftermath.Our first non-hero is Rick Dalton, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, a failing cowboy actor and alcoholic going to seed in the autumn of his career and in moments of bad temper beginning to resemble Jack Black. His best friend – pathetically, his only friend – is Cliff Booth, played by Brad Pitt in his Ocean’s-Eleven mode of easygoing competence and imperturbability. Cliff is Rick’s stunt double and has an awful secret in his life: a grisly event for which he may or may not be guilty. Cliff has to drive Rick everywhere because he has lost his licence, and he is Rick’s best pal, assistant, factotum, and the person who has to straighten Rick when he bursts into boozy tears of self-pity.Things head south for Rick and Cliff’s careers when Rick’s western TV show Bounty Law is cancelled. His agent Marvin Schwarz (an uproarious cameo for Al Pacino) tries persuading Rick to head out to Italy to reinvent himself in these new “spaghetti westerns” they have out there. But in the interim and on the basis of Rick’s boisterous turn on an episode of FBI, Schwarz gets him a job on a western TV show in America, Lancer, with Sam Wanamaker directing, and Rick has a weird epiphany. Apart from everything else, he is inspired by the fact that he lives next door to Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) and Roman Polanski (Rafal Zawierucha), of whom he is entirely in awe.In tandem with the eerie resurgence of Rick’s self-worth, Cliff finds himself giving a lift to a hippie girl out to the Spahn Ranch, that actual movie location which Tarantino imagines to be the place where Cliff and Rick shot films together and which was, of course, the real-life chilling headquarters of the Charles Manson cult. Cliff makes an impassive appearance at this creepy compound and Tarantino audaciously makes this a kind of western-thriller episode, as Cliff makes a social call on the owner, George Spahn (Bruce Dern). Lena Dunham plays one of the acolytes, incidentally, casting which may be a subliminal reminder of the title both of Dunham’s famed TV show Girls, and Emma Cline’s novel about Manson’s followers.Rick and Cliff are basically nonentities, the only difference being that easy-going Cliff has no ego to bruise, no ambition to nurse. But their marginal status is transformed by Tarantino’s parallel-universe comedy.The mention of Polanski and Tate raises the stakes in all sorts of ways: Cliff is offered a blowjob by one of the girls and turns it down because she can’t produce evidence that she is 18. Rick finds himself opening his heart to a preternaturally intelligent child actress (Julia Butters) because he feels that he is over the hill. On hearing that she is eight years old, he mutters that in 15 years time she will know how he feels: a nasty ungallantry of which he is immediately ashamed. All this is a gesture of self-consciousness, a deadpan incitement – and there is no doubt that this is a very male movie, although Margot Robbie gives a sympathetic portrayal of Tate, Dakota Fanning is intimidatingly sinister as the Mansonite called Squeaky and Lorenza Izzo has a spirited turn as the mercurial Italian screen star Francesca Capucci.The most outrageous scene – and the funniest – is Cliff getting a stunt-man job on The Green Hornet and getting challenged to a fight by Bruce Lee in his Kato costume. It is an extraordinary punch-up, though I’m not sure I agree with how Tarantino imagines the result; but I carried on laughing for about three minutes after the scene ended.And then we get the finale, a piece of bloody mayhem which leads to a bizarre denouement which might well have you replaying the entire film in your head. It’s entirely outrageous, disorientating, irresponsible, and also brilliant.Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood screened at the Cannes film festival, and is due for release on 26 July in the US, 14 August in the UK and 15 August in Australia. This article was amended on 20 August 2019 because Lorenza Izzo plays Francesca Capucci, not Francesca Cappuccino as an earlier version said."
Lux Æterna review – self-parodic silliness from Gaspar Noé,Noé’s mockumentary about a movie shoot going horribly wrong goes … horribly wrong,2,"Gaspar Noé has followed up last year’s festival smash Climax with this insufficiently diverting anti-climax, showing in Cannes as a special screening out of competition. It is a 52-minute novella-proportioned sketch, all about a movie shoot going horribly wrong. Commissioned to make a quarter-hour TV ad for Yves Saint Laurent, the director persuaded his sponsors to let him pump it up to something bigger, but not that much bigger – something that might qualify as cinema for Cannes, with people dressed in YSL.Lux Æterna shows Noé reverting to the self-parodic silliness that Climax had taken him past. We get his trademark extended epilepsy-inducing strobe-light effects, and at the beginning, Noé flashes up a quotation from Dostoevsky: “You all, healthy people, can’t imagine the happiness we epileptics feel during the second before our fit …” We get more dark corridors, more claustrophobia, hysteria, madness and the threat of violence – here coded in comic terms. No drugs, though. Perhaps YSL wasn’t on board with that.The stars are Charlotte Gainsbourg and Béatrice Dalle, playing themselves. Gainsbourg is the star of God’s Work, an exploitation horror about witch trials, evidently inspired by Carl Theodor Dreyer’s Day of Wrath. She and a few languid supermodels have to be tied to the stake for the climactic scene. Meanwhile, Dalle has got so furious at the incompetence of the shoot and its endless delays that she is attempting to take over the director’s job. Now the producer is conspiring to get her sacked – a kind of modern-day witch incineration, although Dalle is shown to be an absolute nightmare. All the time the noise and chaos of the infernal darkness is unbearable, and the women are in very serious distress being tied to the stake.Noé loves quoting famous directors on intertitles between scenes, referring to them by their first names: Carl Theodor, Jean-Luc (Godard) and Rainer W (Fassbinder). Noé is facetiously amused, or least preoccupied by the idea of traumatising the actresses involved in his meta-movie. Gainsbourg has to take a mobile call from her infant daughter, upset because some boys did something something horrible to her “foo-foo”, and she has to take the call in a neighbouring set that is devoted to a forensic pathology thriller – a highly unlikely contrivance created just Noé can have Gainsbourg standing next to a fake dismembered female corpse on the anatomist’s slab.The best bit of Lux Æterna is at the very beginning, with a hilarious extended conversation between Dalle and Gainsbourg shown in split-screen. They talk about how every actor’s career contains embarrassing movies that they desperately want to forget, in the way their sexual histories contain some loser that they now want to erase from the memory. Gainsbourg then regales Dalle with a cringe-inducing anecdote that has every appearance of being true. In fact, the scene does look like a very believable late-night chat between two actors marooned on location. The rest of it looks like … a Noé film. Those Gaspar Noé movies about hellish nightmares – are they hellish nightmares to make? Like this? Or do they run like clockwork, from nine to five, managed by entirely sober personnel. I suspect the latter, but everyone has war stories, some worse than this. We are waiting for Noé’s next full-length film. Whether Lux Æterna will boost YSL sales is anyone’s guess.Lux Æterna screened at the Cannes film festival."
Young Ahmed review – subtle and timely tale of radicalisation,"This powerful film from the Dardenne brothers, about a Muslim boy living in a small Belgian town who is attracted to dangerous ideologies",3,"Young Ahmed returns the Dardenne brothers to a keynote theme, expressed in movies such as The Child and The Son: the vulnerability of young people in trouble with the law – and also, paradoxically, their strength, their determination to survive. Theirs is a naive force derived from not caring or understanding how much they have to lose, or indeed how vulnerable are the adult figures placed in authority over them. This is a powerful movie with one very suspenseful “prison” scene – potentially suspenseful at any rate.Another, more vulgarly commercial film-maker might have positioned this scene climactically later in the story and exploited its tension more brazenly; a more ruthless director in the Haneke mould might have done the same thing, but simply to produce a violent, pessimistic shock out of nowhere. The Dardennes are doing something different from any of this, although they once again show their tendency to solve third-act narrative problems with a melodramatic and almost farcical flourish – a chase across open country is not uncommon – and the ending here is not entirely satisfying.Ahmed (played by newcomer Idir Ben Addi) is a 13-year-old Muslim boy in a small Belgian town, whose dad is no longer on the scene and whose mum is struggling with him and his sister. Lacking a father figure, perhaps, and inspired by a cousin who has apparently gone off to be a jihadi fighter (this figure is rather sketchily invoked) Ahmed has become radicalised by a local extremist imam (Othmane Moumen). As his exasperated mum says, only last month his great passion was playing video games.Overnight he has become obnoxious and antisemitic, lecturing his mum on her drinking and his sister on her sexy and revealing clothes – and he now haughtily refuses to shake hands with his hardworking, caring teacher Inès (Myriem Akheddiou) because women are impure and because Inès’s boyfriend is “a Jew”. The imam encourages Ahmed to disrupt Inès’s plans for an after-school club to teach Arabic and Koranic verses using music, because this is sacrilegious. He says that it is all part of the western plan to secularise and dilute Islam. Ahmed is inspired to attempt a violent assault on Inès, which lands him in youth custody, where therapeutic treatments appear to be working wonders, and he convinces the authorities that he is sufficiently reformed for a “making amends” encounter with Inès herself. He might even get close enough for a contrite hug. But is that what he has in mind?Ambiguity is important, of course, and perhaps the most important of Ahmed’s ambiguities is age: is he a boy or a man? He is on the cusp. As a kid, he need only face a relatively short custodial sentence (the terrified imam realises that this exemption very much does not apply to him, if he is proved to be complicit). As a kid, moreover, his misogyny and antisemitism have to be treated cautiously: they are objectionable poses that he has been duped into parroting, but challenging him too directly might cause him simply to retreat into self-important martyrdom that will persist into adulthood – and adulthood isn’t far away.In the custodial centre, Ahmed meets Louise (Victoria Bluck), a teenage girl working on the farm who appears to like him, and there is a spark. But will this tremor of love extinguish his need for righteous violence, or do something else entirely? Ahmed’s prison life is in fact intriguingly unreadable: he may be fooling others, but perhaps the Dardennes’ film is showing us how, in a muddled way, he is facing up to the fact that he has been fooling himself. Yet much of the subtlety and plausible dramatic interest of Young Ahmed is abandoned with a hectic and unsubtly dramatic “chase” sequence, which the directors have created in the interests of a big finish, but this sequence and the final emotional gesture seem rushed and almost perfunctory.

The Whistlers (La Gomera) review – thrilling Romanian corrupt-cop noir,"A bent detective becomes entangled in the crimes he’s investigating in Corneliu Porumboiu’s nifty, twisty drama",4,"Corneliu Porumboiu is the film-maker whose movies such as Police, Adjective (2009) gave festival audiences a taste for his brand of bone-dry black comedy satirising bureaucracy and corruption in post-Ceaușescu Romania. Now he has put together this very watchable, rather exciting noir suspense thriller that has playful echoes of Neil Jordan’s Mona Lisa and even Orson Welles’ The Lady from Shanghai. Veteran Romanian actor Vlad Ivanov is Cristi, a corrupt Bucharest cop who has become involved in the drug-money-laundering setup he has been investigating. Huge amounts of cash are hidden in mattresses for export; these find their way to the island of La Gomera in the Canaries, where the bad guys are headquartered. Cristi has discovered that his superiors (themselves hardly impervious to bribes) suspect him and have placed secret surveillance cameras in his apartment. He knows exactly where they are but must carry on as normal.The fateful day comes when the drug lord’s beautiful girlfriend, Gilda (Catrinel Marlon), comes to meet Cristi. To fool the cops, she pretends to be a high-class sex worker and has sex with him in front of the secret cameras. Gilda feels vaguely affectionate and sorry for the chump but it’s just business; poor Cristi, however, falls deeply in love.The most surreal aspect is that Cristi must be brought over to La Gomera to be schooled in the local (and quite genuine) tradition of silbo whistling – the art of communicating in a whistled version of Spanish. The mobsters use it as a code that the police can’t crack. That whistling could well become a vital channel of communication between Cristi and the object of his unrequited love.Whistling also has other resonances that Porumboiu allows us to ponder. Cristi – and maybe his commanders – have ambiguous identities and loyalties. They could be whistleblowers of a sort, revealing the secrets of their masters (whether police officers or criminals); and they are also snitches, singing like canaries. (The advantage of Gomera’s whistling is that it sounds like birdsong to the uninitiated.)Porumboiu gives us a knotty, twisty, nifty plot that’s quite involved but hangs together well, and there’s an amusing juxtaposition of gloomy, rainy Bucharest and the sunny terrain of La Gomera. We also get a neat and unexpected coda. An elegant and stylishly crafted piece of entertainment.La Gomera (The Whistlers) screened at the Cannes film festival."
Pain and Glory review – life meets art in Almodóvar's wistful extravaganza,The director delivers another sensuous and deeply personal gem as Antonio Banderas’s ageing film-maker faces up to death,4,"Pedro Almodóvar has found a more intensely personal register than ever for his tender new movie about an ageing film director in retreat from his profession, facing ill health, depression and the decline of his powers. It’s Almodóvar’s 21st feature: maybe it could be called 20 ½.Pain and Glory is an autumnal film in a ruminative minor key, with more pain than glory – although glory does make a late resurgence. It brings Almodóvar’s focus to death: his own and those of the people he loves, but also to the passion of film-making which may yet conquer death, or provide a way of coming to terms with it.As ever, Almodóvar has made a film about pleasure, which is itself a pleasure: witty, intelligent and sensuous. It is about love, memory, art, mothers, lovers and most of all it is about itself, which in the hands of a lesser director would be dismayingly indulgent. But Almodóvar is a master of self-reference and intertextuality: the film within a film, the story within a story, the dream within a dream. Almodóvar operates on a kind of internal combustion engine of creativity and I felt that this movie was running so smoothly and so seductively that it could have gone on for another five hours.Antonio Banderas steps up to the role he was born to play, though without the giveaway snowy pompadour. He is Salvador Mallo, a movie director who has not made anything for years but who has accumulated enough money to live in comfort among expensive artworks, brooding on his various ailments – headaches, backaches, a tendency to choke on any solid food – and general depression; all of these having some mysterious cause-or-effect relationship with his creative block.A chance meeting with an old actor friend, Zulema (a cameo for Cecilia Roth) reconnects him with former star actor Alberto (Asier Etxeandia); they quarrelled decades ago while making his masterpiece. Dishevelled Alberto introduces Salvador to heroin, a dangerous new taste that reminds him of an abandoned autobiographical theatre script called Addiction, about a former lover’s drug abuse. He gives it to Alberto to perform on stage and this brings people from the past back into Salvador’s life – and his state of mind is suddenly altered. All the time there are ecstatic memories of his mother, gorgeously played by Penélope Cruz and as an older woman on the brink of death by Julieta Serrano. The older mother is sharply disapproving when her son starts asking for her own memories of her life: “I don’t want any of this in your films.”As ever, cinematographer José Luis Alcaine and production designer Antxón Gómez give the film a wonderful richness and warmth, the colours swarming and popping. There are some big laughs, especially when Alberto and Salvador have been persuaded to do an onstage Q&A after a screening of their controversial film. Almodóvar may well have mixed feelings about the Q&A as a film tradition.There is a masterful nimbleness in Almodóvar’s narrative style: one thing leads on to another, or back or sideways to another, or to an associated memory, or to a created fictional version. We hop back and forth between the past and the present. If there is anything about the film that left me wistfully unsatisfied, it is that this indirectness means the full-on emotional hammer blow never quite comes: the flood of tears or joy or eroticism is somehow deflected or deferred.There is something incomplete or unfinished in this work, but perhaps this simply represents the condition of life itself. Pain and Glory leaves you with a sweet sadness, but a sharp appetite for the next film. Pain and Glory screened at the Cannes film festival and is due for release on 23 August in the UK and 4 October in the US. This article was amended on 12 November 2019 to correct the spelling of José Luis Alcaine."
Little Joe review – Ben Whishaw left in the shade by wilting triffid horror,The talents of an able cast are dismayingly wasted as Jessica Hausner’s chiller fails to deliver on its premise,2,"Jessica Hausner’s Little Joe is one of the most keenly anticipated movies here in Cannes. This brilliant director from Austria has a fascinating body of work – her Lourdes (2009), a mysterious, challenging film about miracles, has a claim to the status of modern classic.But I was disappointed by this new film, her first in English. It’s a quasi sci-fi chiller about people’s behaviour and language being creepily altered; perhaps its numb weirdness is down to a director with no instinctive feeling for the English language. But it’s a fascinating looking film, shot in a cold, clear, crisply refrigerated style that provides an exhilaration of its own.Emily Beecham (from the recent British indie film Daphne) stars as Alice, a workaholic scientist who is developing a top-secret strain of genetically engineered plant whose microbial scent will make people happy. She is divorced and has a school-age son called Joe (Kit Connor). Among her colleagues is Chris (Ben Whishaw), who may well be in love with her, and Bella (Kerry Fox), an older scientist who has just recovered from a breakdown and is permitted to bring her dog to work, wittily named Bello. Soon Alice starts breaking the procedural rules about what she is allowed to do to accelerate the plant’s development. She even brings one home and names it “Little Joe”, a plant with fine, spiky red fronds that stir like the jaws of a venus fly trap. And yes, it starts having an effect on people. But what sort of effect?At first glance, this looks like a scary movie in a Wyndhamesque vein like The Day of the Triffids, or The Midwich Cuckoos (filmed as Village of the Damned). And the buildup is great: there are magnificent shots of football field-sized arrays of plants, all minutely shifting and stirring in the eerily controlled hi-tech greenhouse, like something in a documentary by Nikolaus Geyrhalter, who is a master of this sort of alienated-nature tableau. The scientists themselves, affectless and introverted in their white coats, add to the strangeness. What is going to happen? What skin-crawling developments are going to creep up on us? What denouement is going to scare us senseless?That remains an open question. It feels as if this movie is too grandly high on the arthouse register to bother with out-and-out thrills or suspense. And there are plot implausibilities that a humble genre movie might have ironed out at the script stage: would a high-level scientific research facility allow dogs in? And is it really possible to break in with just a stolen ID?The awful truth is that the plants don’t seem to be changing people’s behaviour in any obviously entertaining or scary way – or even in a clever one. The point seems to be that the affected people are perceived bizarrely to be impersonating themselves, or that they will release urges that have been suppressed, such as Alice’s guilty desire to free herself of the bonds of parenthood. But none of this is represented in any compelling dramatic style, and the actors – all very talented and assured – have perhaps not had clear enough direction. It is a mood piece. Whose mood leads nowhere.Little Joe screened at the Cannes film festival."
Batman in 4k review – 1990s model of the caped crusader re-emerges in style,"Tim Burton’s noirish Gotham still looks impressive, while Joel Schumacher’s come off a little wacky",0,"Jack Nicholson’s 1989 turn as The Joker in Batman (★★★★☆) provided an almighty bang to start what was to become a tetralogy of movies, all four being re-released to mark the Dark Knight’s 80th anniversary in DC Comics. This Joker is a purple-clad supervillain who upstages Michael Keaton’s diffident Batman with no difficulty and whose capering craziness is periodically supercharged by the sound of Prince on the soundtrack. Directed by Tim Burton, the movie has a brooding noir feel. It even showed prostitution on the streets of Gotham City. The Joker is given an origin myth; Jack Napier (the JN initials leaning heavily on Nicholson’s own legendary bad-boy status) is a mobster and former street hoodlum with a fateful connection to the young Bruce Wayne. When he accidentally falls into a chemical vat during a shootout in a pharmaceutical factory, the fumes cause his face to contract into that hideous grin. A bad-guy barmstormer from Jack.The 1992 follow-up Batman Returns (★★☆☆☆) again directed by Burton and starring Keaton, is a strange beast. Michelle Pfeiffer gives us a fierce Catwoman who gets wittily transformed from a dowdy, spinsterish “cat lady”. But the look of Danny DeVito’s Penguin sails uncomfortably (but unintentionally) close to the antisemitic tropes that made Batman Returns hugely controversial at the time and perhaps explains the character’s absence from the Batman films ever since. He has a shabby coat, a top hat, a hook nose. The hook nose is supposed to resemble a Penguin’s beak, the shabby evening wear a visual pun on penguin-suit/tuxedo. But when the Penguin arrives in the story as an abandoned baby, did he have to arrive in a Moses basket?Batman Forever (★★★★☆) saw Joel Schumacher take over the directorial reins in 1995, and it was a buff Val Kilmer ­as Batman in this enjoyably camp iteration. His caped crusader is planning to renounce his vocation to pursue his love affair with Nicole Kidman’s slinky psychotherapist Chase Meridian. Tommy Lee Jones is Two-Face and a typically hyperactive Jim Carrey gets laughs as the Riddler. The somewhat forgotten Chris O’Donnell is brought in as Robin, and he’s actually not bad. The whole thing is just that little bit wackier, perhaps closer to the 60s TV version – although Two-Face’s burns are nastier than that show would have permitted.Arnold Schwarzenegger got top billing over George Clooney in 1997’s Batman & Robin (★★★☆☆), playing Mr Freeze to George’s Batman, and Michael Gough makes a poignant final appearance as Alfred. Uma Thurman is the unhinged environmentalist Poison Ivy (“Gotham will be mine for the greening”) and Alicia Silverstone is Batgirl (she reclaims the sexist word). An amiable, almost farcical Batman episode, with George in Nespresso mode."
Breakthrough review – dreary real-life 'resurrection' drama,A teenager declared dead after falling through the ice is miraculously brought back to life in this undistinguished faith-based tale,2,"Here is another illustration of how the faith-based drama has pushed into cinemas material indistinguishable from vast swathes of the afternoon TV schedule. A true-life miracle has been sourced from Judith Smith’s memoir: the resurrection of the author’s adopted Guatemalan son John, declared clinically dead after falling through the ice on Lake St Louis in January 2015. Yet it is presented with no mystery and scant wonder; instead, we get two hours of flatly professional procedural.Scene by scene, life-or-death reality is reduced to Sunday-school parable. Early sequences show Marcel Ruiz’s John, something of a novelty in his God-fearing, Caucasian neighbourhood, boosting his outsider reputation by shrugging off homework and feeding mama’s scrambled eggs to the dog, micro-rebellions that – in the film’s sexless, curse-free universe – signify he’s already skating on thin ice.While we await his rebirth as a meekly assenting believer, seasoned TV director Roxann Dawson kills time with sidebars in which burly rescue workers and doctors question whether they too heard a voice out on the ice or saw signs in the OR, working overtime to claim John’s survival as divine intervention rather than, say, a consequence of devout medical care, or a teenage basketball player’s innate resilience.Writer Grant Nieporte allows for small, semi-intriguing pockets of tension beneath the bland surface, such as an ongoing niggle between the film’s traditionalist Judith (Chrissy Metz) and jeans-sporting Pastor Jason (Topher Grace), whose fondness for Christian rap-rock threatens the sanctity of the congregation’s megachurch. Yet they’re smoothed over in a second half over-reliant on damp-eyed hyperventilation.When a closing-credit photo appears showing the real John Smith posing with pals on the same frozen waters that nearly took his life, you too may hear voices, doubtless screaming: “For heaven’s sake, stop doing that.”"
Trial by Fire review – old-fashioned death row drama pulses with anger,"Jack O’Connell and Laura Dern impress in a sturdy, no-frills retelling of an enraging true story about a man who might have been wrongfully convicted of killing his children ",3,"Quietly premiering at last year’s Telluride film festival alongside bigger, splashier titles, the worthy fact-based drama Trial by Fire quickly became one of the season’s most inevitable casualties, a crushing lack of buzz immediately putting an end to any potential awards run. A decade or so ago, this might not have been the case. Based on the true story of a man claiming wrongful imprisonment, directed by Oscar-winning film-maker and producer Edward Zwick, scripted by Geoffrey Fletcher, the Oscar-winning screenwriter of Precious and starring two-time Oscar nominee Laura Dern, it’s the sort of sturdy prestige-y project that would have been a contender in a different, simpler time.The film’s old-fashioned nature is a plus and a minus, delivering us the satisfying beats we’ve come to expect from such a story, yet also giving it a dusty, dated feel, playing like a mid-90s TV movie stumbled upon late at night. The story at its centre has been previously explored in a 2011 documentary but the film takes its inspiration from David Grann’s 2009 New Yorker article of the same name. In 1991, 23-year-old Cameron Todd Willingham (Jack O’Connell) wakes to the sound of crying. His house is on fire and his three daughters are trapped in the other room. He’s unable to save them but, to police, he was never really trying to, their immediate assumption implicating him in their deaths. A trial ensues; Willingham’s shambolic public defender is neither able to save him from a conviction nor the death penalty.Seven years later, an unlikely set of circumstances brings playwright Elizabeth Gilbert (Dern) into Willingham’s life. Still on death row, he’s resigned himself to his fate but when Gilbert starts to dig around, he starts to allow the idea that justice might be served.There’s a steady current of righteous anger coursing through Trial by Fire, a film that begins as a self-contained story of one man’s injustice before transforming into a damning indictment of an entire legal system. The steep rise in popularity and prolificacy of the true crime documentary has given us an increased awareness of the nuts and bolts of the courtroom, and however thin this added knowledge might be, it helps to make the film’s initial stretch that much more infuriating. Willingham was betrayed by a system that had already judged him as a worthless miscreant before the investigation even started, and Fletcher’s script doesn’t hold back on the various levels of incompetence and apathy that kept him locked up for so many years.Willingham is by no means a saint, and the film doesn’t paint him as such, choosing instead to show him as a difficult man with a short fuse and a predilection for both violence and infidelity. But it also asks us to avoid our own judgments despite this, and there’s a rare humanity afforded to Willingham and a fellow inmate, played by Ozark’s McKinley Belcher III in an impressive cameo. O’Connell, no stranger to playing spiky, brutish characters, eases into the role, equally adept at portraying the rough and the smooth, and he helps add grit to what can often be staid film-making. As the Susan Sarandon to his Sean Penn, Dern only arrives about halfway through, but carries with her the requisite outrage to sell her character’s unusual immersion into a disconnected narrative. While the film does make familiar pitstops, the pair are spared any overly forced moments of conflict or Oscarbait monologuing, and the script makes Gilbert’s attempts to free him feel grounded and specific.It’s in Trial by Fire’s final stretch when it finally manages to distinguish itself from so many similar films of its ilk. Much of this is down to the unavoidably enraging facts of what really happened. At the time, Trump’s future secretary of energy Rick Perry was governor of Texas, and his callous lack of interest in re-examining Willingham’s case, despite undeniable new information, is placed at the forefront, especially in a chilling coda. Zwick is a director whose most famed projects are long behind him, from Glory to Legends of the Fall to Blood Diamond, and his direction often feels similarly old-school. But there’s a prescience to his motivation here, an urgent messaging embedded in the film that also makes it feel deeply necessary.It’s easy to see why Trial by Fire was buried in an awards season that brought us The Favourite, Black Panther, BlacKkKlansman and Roma, films that felt fresh swallowing up a film that feels inarguably commonplace. But it’s a story that deserves another airing and by presenting the facts in such a straightforward fashion, it’s hard not to feel incensed.Trial by Fire is out in the US on 17 May and in the UK at a later date"
Amazing Grace review – soul-shaking gospel from Aretha Franklin,"A spellbinding performance by the late, great singer is captured in Sydney Pollack’s 1972 film – finally brought to the screen after a long technical and legal battle",4,"The 1970s may have been the heyday of the rock concert film, but the genre was frequently marred by questionable performances and legal squabbles. Whether it’s Led Zeppelin going off the boil in the wrangle-ridden The Song Remains the Same or the Rolling Stones finding themselves stars of an unfolding horror movie in the Maysles’s Gimme Shelter, these movies are fraught with strife. It’s significant that the most celebrated concert film of all, Martin Scorsese’s The Last Waltz, captured the Band as they were splitting up, cementing the genre’s long-standing funereal affiliations and serving as inspiration for Rob Reiner’s nail-in-the-coffin mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap.The story of Amazing Grace, centring on Aretha Franklin’s two-night performance in 1972 which led to the biggest selling live gospel album of all time, is no less troubled. Apparently inspired by the financial success of Mike Wadleigh’s festival behemoth Woodstock, and with an eye on increasingly “synergistic” film/music/TV markets, Warners enlisted Oscar winner Sydney Pollack to direct multi-camera 16mm footage of the 29-year-old Franklin recording her next album at the New Temple Missionary Baptist church in Los Angeles.Unfortunately, with his background in drama rather than music docs, Pollack failed to use clapperboards or markers, making it virtually impossible to synch the resulting picture with the recorded sound. Not even lip readers, who were reportedly enlisted to sift through hours of silent film, could solve the problem.Instead, the footage languished in the vaults for decades until producer Alan Elliott began working on a reconstruction using previously unavailable digital technologies. Several years after Pollack’s death in 2008, Elliott had managed to assemble a workable cut, only to have his efforts scuppered by lawsuits from Franklin claiming unauthorised appropriation of her likeness. Although she told the Detroit Free Press in 2015 that “I love the film itself”, Aretha continued to contest its release, and the legal issues have only now been resolved in the wake of the singer’s death, turning what was once a celebration into something more like a eulogy.So, after nearly five decades, does the film stand the test of time? Hallelujah, yes! Despite being both unforgivingly overlit and tantalisingly truncated (this trim 88-minute cut abridges or omits some classic tracks), Elliott’s Lazarus-like resurrection of Pollack’s movie captures both the hive of musical activity and fervour or religious ecstasy that thronged through that church all those years ago.I’ve often argued that cinemas – at least, the good ones – share a sacred-space status with places of worship. It’s a belief confirmed by the sight of Franklin seated at the piano for a tender rendition of Marvin Gaye’s Wholy Holy, or standing at the pulpit for her soul-shaking delivery of Amazing Grace. On record, that church sounds vast, yet Pollack’s footage emphasises both the compact nature of the congregation (encouraged to swell their voices for the recording) and the intimate size of the auditorium – an intimacy which merely amplifies the songs’ emotional power. No wonder the Rev James Cleveland is reduced to tears, a reaction I guarantee will be repeated in cinemas everywhere.You can feel the heat that sets beads of sweat running from the musician’s brows. At one point, the Rev CL Franklin steps over to mop his daughter’s face as she climbs the mountain of yet another towering performance. Studiously attentive between numbers (it’s hard to reconcile this understated Aretha with the persona cultivated elsewhere), she takes flight in song, her eyes either closed in concentration or flutteringly focused on some distant horizon, way beyond the here and now.As Aretha’s voice transcends this world, Pollack’s crew have the more down-to-earth task of catching ever more adventurous angles, peering up through the lid of a piano or down through the ranks of the congregation. There’s a scrappy, vérité feel to the footage as the crew capture each other on camera, scuttling around in response to the gesticulations of their director. Mick Jagger and Charlie Watts are picked out lurking at the back of the hall, learning lessons from gospel star Clara Ward is in attendance too, a regal presence bestowing a sense of history in the making.Best of all, however, is the sight of Alexander Hamilton conducting the Southern California Community Choir through the emotional highs and lows of the music with moves that are as joyfully expressive as the songs themselves. When a parishioner leaps to her feet, her spirit clearly moved, you’ll want to do the same. Wholy Holy indeed."
Madeline’s Madeline review – feverish psychological thriller,A vulnerable drama student is exploited by her teacher in this experimental drama from Josephine Decker,4,"In the third feature from maverick American film-maker Josephine Decker, a medicated 16-year-old theatre student named Madeline (Helena Howard, an arresting debut) finds herself in an increasingly unstable headspace as her overbearing acting teacher Evangeline (Molly Parker) provokes her for the sake of performance. Her mother (a convincingly wobbly Miranda July) attempts to intervene; no such luck as Madeline spins further into her own private chaos, as emphasised by cinematographer Ashley Connor’s increasingly feverish camerawork and woozy, Vaseline-smeared lens. Decker’s own background is in experimental theatre; this film was built from improvisational workshops rather than a traditional script. The dilemma she presents is ethical: is it fair to ask someone to traumatise (or retraumatise) themselves for the sake of art? Rather boldly, it seems as though Decker is also asking the question of herself."
Destination Wedding review – Ryder and Reeves carry caustic romance,Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves entertain as they sell us the ‘myth’ of love,3,"He (Keanu Reeves) is a corporate bore with a bad attitude, and the half-brother of the groom. She (Winona Ryder) is an optimist, but an over-thinker, an over-talker and the groom’s ex. Naturally, they hate each other on sight, but trapped at a destination wedding in Californian wine country, they’re “the people you don’t know where to stick” and so they’re stuck together. The way the film skewers the wedding industrial complex (and the romantic comedy’s complicity in it) is very funny. The couple must participate in forced fun, such as an 11am wine tasting and zorbing; twee party favours and internet-ordained priests are rightly ridiculed. The respective star qualities of Reeves and Ryder are mined for comedy, with his action-hero opacity and her chatty neuroticism cannily deployed.Writer-director Victor Levin’s caustic take on the romcom works better as a treatise on the genre than as an example of it. The staging of the individual scenes feels like an afterthought, with the stars and script doing all the heavy lifting. Still, the scaffolding is there: two charming and capable leads, rapid-fire banter, an airport, a wedding. Levin sketches his thesis through the film’s dialogue. He sends up Frank (Reeves) and Lindsay (Ryder) as self-confessed “trite, trivial, tone-deaf narcissists”, as though anticipating criticism about the characters’ privileged milieu or the genre’s purported irrelevance. “I’m sorry if my brand of pain is out of vogue, but it’s all I’ve got,” scoffs Lindsay. In its worst moments, some of the preemptive verbal jockeying feels defensive and out of touch.The things it has to say about intimacy, commitment, “the dangled carrot of the future” and the “self-fulfilling prophecy” of cynicism feel fresher. Lindsay insists that even if love is a myth, there must be a sliver of truth, and that the converted have a responsibility “to make others believe”. Against the odds, Reeves and Ryder sell it."
Madeline's Madeline review – teenager's troubles take centre stage,"In this absorbing, weirdly moving drama, Molly Parker plays a theatre director throwing the spotlight on her young star’s mental health issues",4,"Here is a gigantically risky film about emotional development and theatrical performance, swinging wildly from the end of the limb that it’s just gone out on. I can quite see why some might find it insufferable. Yet I found it absorbing and weirdly moving.Newcomer Helena Howard plays Madeline, an emotionally troubled teenager who has joined a radically experimental physical theatre company, run by charismatic Evangeline (Molly Parker). With absolute lack of self-consciousness and passionate commitment, Madeline throws herself into improvising being a cat, or a sea turtle, crawling and purring around the apartment at home.Soon Evangeline is deeply impressed with her new star and is planning to devise a project around her, perhaps centring it on Madeline’s recent experiences in the psychiatric ward, and even bringing her increasingly alarmed mother, Regina (Miranda July), into the show. But Regina fears that this theatre project, so far from being therapeutic, may simply accelerate Madeline into another episode. Madeline’s attitude to her new mentor or quasi-mother figure is itself complex; it is never entirely clear if what we see on screen is actually happening or if Madeline is imagining it.For any British person watching this film’s rehearsal scenes, it is impossible not to remember Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie’s sketch about theatre types gathering from the buttocks, and I am someone who instinctively sympathises with Laurence Olivier in the legendary anecdote about telling Dustin Hoffman on the set of Marathon Man to “try acting, dear boy”. And yet there is something arresting about these sequences; they are presented with such force. And where are we going with it all? Who exactly is heading for a breakdown? And is heading for a breakdown the point anyway?The movie’s tone and its narrative arc are intriguingly elusive. At various times, it resembles Roman Polanski’s Repulsion, Charlie Kaufman’s Synecdoche, New York and Alan Parker’s Fame. It’s an immersive and exotic experience. Howard is a revelation."
High Life review – Robert Pattinson heads to infinity and beyond,"An astronaut on an odyssey to a distant black hole faces the challenges of parenting – and existential panic – in Claire Denis’ superbly eerie, mysterious space drama",5,"Claire Denis’s deep-space trauma High Life is an Old Testament parable catapulted forward into the 23rd century, a primal scene in a pressurised cabin of sci-fi pessimism, suppressed horror and denied panic. As if in a recurring dream, Denis brings us repeatedly to the image of a cream-panelled spaceship corridor that curves sharply around to the right; the area is at first pristine and then, as the years go by, shabby and derelict, stained with what may be body fluids. And what is around that corner?This is a bizarre new creationist myth for those of us who ever wondered in childhood, and then forgot to wonder, about the taboo-breaking involved in propagating a race from just two people in the Garden of Eden, or two species representatives in the ark. It is also a tale of imperial expansion and sexual beings under pressure, just as in earlier Denis movies such as Beau Travail (1999) or White Material (2009); this is written by Denis with Jean-Pol Fargeau, Geoff Cox and Nick Laird, shot with luminous mystery by cinematographer Yorick Le Saux, with an eerie musical score by Stuart Staples of the band Tindersticks.At its centre is Monte, played by Robert Pattinson, who is evidently all alone on a spaceship that exterior shots reveal to be shaped entirely without the elegant streamlined curves of a craft designed for purposeful travel. It is huge and rectangular, suspended in space like a clunking great container unit full of rubbish. Actually, Monte isn’t entirely alone. He has a tiny infant with him called Willow, whom he tends to and talks to conscientiously but unsmilingly.Denis creates a grippingly unreadable dynamic right here. There is something adorable in the trusting baby and the adult’s care, and yet nothing else around speaks of gentleness and love. It’s not at all clear, in fact, that Monte is capable of love, or if events have not rendered the emotion of love obsolete.Monte talks of recycling the child’s excrement, and the film reflects that the crew members themselves are recycled waste: marginal, transgressive figures who have been put to work in what may be the service of mankind, or some mendacious or desperate plan born of humanity’s fear of its own impending extinction.Flashbacks reveal that Monte was once one of an extensive crew, an anti-community of former prisoners among whom there is unbearable tension. There appears to be no captain or leader in any traditional sense; the nearest thing to an authority figure is the white-coated Dibs, played by Juliette Binoche, someone with medical training.Like all the other desperate souls on board, Dibs has a past and is expected to redeem that past by taking part in this experimental space mission: to harvest the energy of a distant black hole and bring it back to Earth. But the journey there will be longer than any normal human lifespan, so the crew members are expected to breed, to create a second or third generation that will be in a position to deal with the black hole when the ship finally arrives.Dibs is in charge of something called the Fuck Box (like the Orgasmatron of old), which facilitates and manages their erotic needs, making these easier to channel into procreation. (As with other Denis films, such as Let the Sunshine In, there is an idle, subsidiary pleasure in wondering how it would be if the Binoche part was given to Isabelle Huppert.)The pure radioactive strangeness of High Life has something in common with Douglas Trumbull’s Silent Running (1972) in its onboard vegetable garden (although this garden is small, and perhaps symbolically represented). And there is something of Andrei Tarkovsky’s Solaris (1972) in the glitzy, alienated weightlessness of everyone’s spacecraft existence being juxtaposed with the non-technological naturalness of Planet Earth: the soil, the streams, the grasses, those wild textures and smeared surfaces so different from the controlled metallic gleam of that incarceration way out in space. It is here that there will be almost limitless violence, a psycho-chemical reaction, a silent detonation, from which some kind of enigmatic new hope, or anticipation for the future is to emerge.As with so many of Denis’ films, the point is to contrive an overwhelmingly powerful mood and moment, an almost physiological sensation, this one incubated in the vast, cold reaches of space. It throbbed and itched with me long after the film was over."
Wine Country review – Amy Poehler's Netflix comedy is a drunken riot,The actor makes her directorial debut with a wine-soaked gem about a group of women trying to keep their friendship together during a weekend away,4,"Bemoaning the ever-decreasing quality of Saturday Night Live has become almost as much of an institution as actually watching Saturday Night Live, its current season so punishingly unfunny that it’s often hard to remember a time when that wasn’t the case. Reminders are usually embedded elsewhere with ex-writers and cast members reliably cropping up on the big and small screen to show us what a fertile breeding ground the show has been for comedy in the last 45 years. It’s hard not to watch the Netflix comedy Wine Country without thinking about what brought its seven main stars and two main writers together, the film a showcase of their combined talents and proof of SNL’s long-lasting influence.Inspired by a 2016 getaway, the film follows a group of friends reuniting to celebrate a birthday in Napa Valley, California. It’s been planned by control freak Abby (Amy Poehler), whose detailed itinerary for the weekend doesn’t allow much breathing room, something that introduces tension among the group. But they’re all keen to avoid problems and, in turn, playing up to a misogynistic cliche of women arguing with each other. It’s easier said than done, though, with Naomi (Maya Rudolph) harbouring a secret, Catherine (Ana Gasteyer) struggling to detach herself from work, Val (Paula Pell) obsessing over a waitress she’s fallen for, Jenny (Emily Spivey) trying to keep her anxieties at bay and birthday girl Rebecca (Rachel Dratch) refusing to accept the implications of turning 50.There’s not a lot of plot at play in Wine Country, which is both a good and bad thing, depending on the scene. When we’re trusted to just hang out with the women as they drink and riff off each other, it’s a blast. There’s an engaging, hard-to-fake chemistry between the group and while scenes often have a naturalistic tone, there’s a refreshing lack of indulgence, something that can afflict comedies populated by real-life friends. It’s loose, yet disciplined, avoiding those rambling Apatowian scenes of improv that at their worst can feel boringly protracted.It’s virtually impossible not to gain pleasure from these scenes, whether it’s Pell gifting the group bespoke vibrators, Spivey listing her ground rules for a playlist (“I don’t want any Quentin Tarantino soundtracks. I’m done”) or Rudolph, one of the all-time great fake drunks, messily grieving Prince in a hot tub. Unlike other post-Bridesmaids comedies about a group of women letting loose, there’s also a refusal to play into certain repetitive tropes. While there’s a heavy amount of drinking, it doesn’t lead to an escalation of raucous trailer-ready moments. The women are self-confessed nerds and in one scene, which felt like direct commentary on what we might expect to happen, Gasteyer suggests they all micro-dose MDMA, an idea that falls flat with a chorus of disinterest.We assume conflict will arrive, and it does, although there’s a well-observed buildup, with a sharp series of scenes that see the women pair off to casually criticise each other and a smart script, from Spivey and Liz Cackowski (who delivers a funny cameo as a pretentious wine expert) that refrains from offering us a clear antagonist, each woman a believable balance. When the script does try to force a more conventional narrative, creaks can be heard, especially in an underwhelming sequence of physical comedy near the end. Starry cameos are kept to a minimum and while Cherry Jones’s grim-minded tarot card reader is a hysterically funny inclusion, Jason Schwartzman’s paella-obsessed chef is far less successful, sucking the comedy out of the film when on screen. Tina Fey’s gruff local falls somewhere between the two, at times feeling miscast and at others, making you wish she had more screen-time.In fact, more screen-time all round wouldn’t have been a bad thing, the group proving such addictive company that a limited series might have been more welcome, providing us with even more of the wine-soaked freewheeling that works so well. Poehler, sitting in the director’s chair for the first time, is a functional film-maker who realises that her film isn’t in need of a great many visual flourishes in order to fly. Rudolph is a standout, allowed to be part of the fun in a way that she wasn’t in Bridesmaids, while Pell and Spivey, both predominantly known for their writing, are surprising aces in the hole. In another more commercially restricted film, they might have been coerced out by producers wanting bigger names but as with many Netflix originals, there’s something unfiltered and unsullied about Wine Country. There’s no Apatow-enforced romantic subplot, for example, and it feels like a film about women made by women.The very fact that Wine Country is about a group of women approaching or surviving their 50s makes it depressingly unusual. The post-Bridesmaids uplift in films about female friendship has been slight and the films since have quite often focused on either younger women (see: Rough Night, Someone Great and Ibiza) or older caricatures (see: Book Club and the upcoming Poms). There’s a comfortable embrace of ageing in the film that goes a bit deeper than jokes about menopause, each character increasingly aware of their mortality.Wine Country is scrappy and, at times, misjudged but it’s also very, very funny with a cast of women whose collective charm makes the patchier moments forgivable. Watching it with wine helps, too.Wine Country is available on Netflix from 10 May"
Streaming: 2018's boldest directorial debut finally finds a platform,"Eva Trobisch’s acclaimed Alles is gut is out now on Netflix. Plus, the compelling rise of New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez",0,"I try, I really do, not to fall back on Netflix too often in a column meant to cover a growing streaming realm: in one sense, it feels like a restaurant critic plucking their subjects from a shopping mall food court. Yet the commitment of the biggest brand in home entertainment to a spirit of genuine discovery continues to surprise on a near-weekly basis. When I saw that German director Eva Trobisch’s first film, Alles ist gut (2018), had quietly slipped on to this week’s online release roster – yet another low-profile critics’ cause quietly plucked from the festival circuit and rebranded as a Netflix Original – I couldn’t think of anything I’d rather spotlight.I first encountered Alles ist gut – named All Good in English, though only the German title shows up on Netflix’s search engine – at last summer’s Locarno film festival. In the sticky August swelter, it landed like a hard-frozen ice pack to the neck. Since the #MeToo movement broke out in 2017, it has become idle critical practice to label almost any notionally feminist film as emblematic of the movement, but Trobisch’s unsparingly observed drama of sexual assault and its fallout in the workplace distils this cultural moment without any cheap button-pushing.The story is simple, its psychology complex. A young woman called Janne (the extraordinary Aenne Schwarz) is raped by a stranger whose advances she rejects at a school reunion, only to find shortly afterwards that he’s her new colleague. Janne’s plan not to tell anyone, even her sensitive boyfriend, about the assault and continue as before – “All good”, she tells everyone, herself included – comes apart in progressively painful, chaotic ways. It’s as subtle and exacting a study of post-rape trauma as any in memory, and easily the most poised and auspicious directorial debut I saw last year.I wasn’t alone in my admiration, as Alles ist gut was duly rewarded by the festival jury, while my Observer colleague Wendy Ide named it among her top films of 2018 for Screen Daily. Yet it seemed at risk of sinking without trace after bigger autumn festivals such as Toronto and London passed it over, while no big-screen distributor stepped forward for a film that is, however you slice it, a bruising watch. Intimately cinematic as it is, perhaps Netflix is the perfect platform for Alles ist gut: you may want to watch it on your own, and in your own time; either way, don’t miss it.If it’s feminist uplift you want, however, Netflix’s other big release of the week should fit the bill. A crowd favourite at Sundance in January, Rachel Lears’s lively, purposeful documentary Knock Down the House is already assured a place in the archives as the first film portrait of the US Democrats’ fast-rising force of nature, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. A little-known outsider at the start of filming, the smart, dauntless Bronx bartender turned congresswoman grows before our eyes into a fierce political animal.Conventionally constructed, but as snappy and persuasive as its subjects, Lears’s film isn’t merely an AOC valentine, but devotedly covers the trajectories of three other progressive Democrat women – Amy Vilela, Cori Bush and Paula Jean Swearengin – who challenged incumbents in last year’s midterm elections. Ocasio-Cortez may emerge as its star by virtue both of her salt-and-vinegar charisma and the eventual outcome of her campaign, but the documentary bristles with restless hope for a smarter, kinder, less oppressively male-oriented political future.A Face in the Crowd(Sony, 12)The latest addition to the Criterion library, Elia Kazan’s brilliantly vicious media satire may be from 1957, but its portrayal of cynical political populism is so acutely Trump-era, it hurts.Fahrenheit 11/9(Vertigo, 15)Meanwhile, Michael Moore’s present-day attempt to nail down the Trump problem doesn’t land as hard – his strident muckraking is as entertaining as ever, but it’s too familiar by now to carry much in the way of power.Girl(Curzon Artificial Eye, 15)Artful and exquisitely acted it may be, but Lukas Dhont’s portrait of a teenage transgender ballerina has proven fiercely divisive, prompting accusations of trans erasure and exploitation in some quarters. It’s worth making up your own mind."
"The Intruder review – Dennis Quaid goes gonzo in fun, silly thriller",A couple find themselves the target of a madman in a familiar retread of early 90s psycho-from-hell thrillers that squeezes enjoyment from tired cliches,3,"After its peak in the early 90s, the psycho-from-hell thriller, typified by films such as Fatal Attraction, Single White Female and Pacific Heights, died a villain’s death at the box office, only rearing its head infrequently in the years since. In the late 00s, Sony’s genre label Screen Gems spotted a gap in the market and started pumping out variations on a cookie-cutter formula but with one key difference. Films such as Obsessed, No Good Deed, The Perfect Guy and When the Bough Breaks have been almost universally populated by actors of colour in strict opposition to the all-white thrillers that came before them.But while they might have represented a step forward for diversity, the same can’t be said for quality, and rather than add anything new to tried and tired subgenre tropes, they have felt lazily recycled and, even worse, horribly sanitised. With limiting PG-13 ratings and scripts that have failed to recognise the streak of perversity that made the originals so much fun, they have often resembled cheap TV remakes, each as anonymous as the other.Which makes the release of The Intruder, yet another glossy PG-13 melodrama from Screen Gems about a black couple tormented by an exterior evil, feel like an unexciting prospect, its beats easy to predict from a quick glance of its synopsis and its entertainment level easy to predict from the dross that’s come before. After closing a “big deal”, Scott (Michael Ealy) finally agrees with his wife Annie (Meagan Good) that a move to the countryside might be for the best. The pair discover an extravagant, secluded house that Annie immediately falls in love with and after agreeing on a deal with the owner Charlie (Dennis Quaid), they move in. But as they soon discover, Charlie isn’t quite ready to move out.There’s an unavoidable stench of familiarity wafting through The Intruder, most pungent in the early stretch as some rather drab, perfunctory dialogue takes us through scenes we know all too well. The “business” chat is hilariously vague (“I knew you’d close the deal!”; “You’re the number one earner in the company!”) as is Annie’s job (she writes about “injustice and empowerment for women’s magazines” yet we never see her type a single word). But as the cogs speed up, something relatively miraculous happens: it actually starts to work. The pace is well modulated by director Deon Taylor (who was behind last year’s scrappy exploitation pic Traffik), the escalation of events is involving and tense and the central trio develops a strong, uneasy dynamic.Good is likable, if stuck with an increasingly infuriating naive wife role, while Ealy fares better as the good guy than he did playing the villain, to unconvincing effect, in The Perfect Guy. But the film really belongs to Quaid, having enviable amounts of gonzo fun as the unhinged antagonist, dialling the menace up high when needed without going full ham by the end. He’s allowed some wild excesses, which, as mentioned, have been in short supply in these films of late, with one particular moment of frenzied licking causing vocal audience revulsion. Leering, sneering, crawling and groping his way through the film, it’s the kind of fearless yet measured performance that only really comes from an actor this late in his career, his vast experience providing him with both the courage to go big and the discipline to rein it in.Screenwriter David Loughery also worked with Neil LaBute on the first Screen Gems domestic thriller, 2008’s underrated Lakeview Terrace, which saw Samuel L Jackson terrorise Patrick Wilson and Kerry Washington. It was similarly structured stuff but there was also an intriguingly insidious racial element with Jackson’s bitter cop infuriated that an interracial couple was living next door. Loughery doesn’t try quite so hard to embed anything as interesting here, but there’s a light throughline about challenged masculinity with a gun-toting “alpha” threatening a gun-averse “beta”, even if it’s slightly squandered in the finale, one that directly cribs from Sleeping with the Enemy.But then that’s sort of the point of these films anyway, patch-working elements from the thrillers that wrote the rules back in the late 80s and early 90s and seeing if they still work. The Intruder isn’t bringing much that’s new to the table but what it does, it does well, and there’s something to admire about its stark efficiency, dragging us along with full force, even if we know exactly where we’re going.The Intruder is released in the US on 3 May and in the UK on 26 July."
The Isle review – shipwreck sailors head into deeper trouble,Three survivors of a tragedy at sea wash up on the shores of a mysterious island in this intelligent supernatural drama,3,"The Isle is a well-made, forcefully acted film from director Matthew Butler-Hart; he has co-written the screenplay with his partner Tori Butler-Hart – who also acts in the movie – and together they have created an intriguing work, modestly and intelligently conceived, a supernatural melodrama characterised by an eerie sort of restraint. There are hints of Shakespeare and classical and Scots mythology.It is the mid-19th century and three sailors, Oliver (Alex Hassell), Jim (Graham Butler) and Cailean (Fisayo Akinade) are the only survivors of a terrible wreck. On their leaky lifeboat they have somehow made it over to a mysterious island off the Scottish coast, where the inhabitants clearly have terrible secrets and are strangely unhelpful when it comes to getting these men back to the mainland. They are Douglas (played by Conleth Hill, from Game of Thrones and Frank Skinner’s Blue Heaven) and Fingal (Dickon Tyrell); and there are two young women who are also stricken with dysfunction and fear – Lanthe (Tori Butler-Hart) and Korrigan (Alex Wilton Regan).What is happening here? There are moments of hallucination and nightmare, but in some way the entire action of the movie could be seen as an extended bad dream. Butler-Hart shows great craftsmanship in his efficient use of location – he could even have afforded to be brasher in the scary moments, but I appreciated his cool approach.This is the sort of British movie that I can imagine being made by Michael Reeves or Robin Hardy back in the 60s and 70s, drama that’s all about strong characterisation and heady atmosphere."
Vox Lux review – a pop star rises from the flames of violence,"Natalie Portman stars in the thrilling, chilling tale of a teenager who becomes a sensation after a horrific event at her school",3,"A dark star is born in this intriguing if weirdly anticlimactic and undeveloped new film from Brady Corbet. It has a stunning and genuinely disturbing premise, but no equally strong third-act ideas. There certainly isn’t anything like the killer punch of his feature debut, The Childhood of a Leader (2016), and, as the pop star at the centre of the movie, Natalie Portman goes into a pretty broad In Bed With Madonna routine that doesn’t deliver anything overwhelmingly insightful.As an actor, Corbet has worked with Lars von Trier, Michael Haneke and Olivier Assayas. As a director, he found a great deal of their icy elegance and formal provocation in Childhood, working with partner and co-writer Mona Fastvold: an extraordinarily audacious and mysterious study of fascism in its cradle. Vox Lux is a film with obvious resemblances to that previous film: there is the same sense of an eerily implacable destiny, another amazing orchestral score by the late Scott Walker, and the same casting mannerism of using the same actor twice. But to what end?Raffey Cassidy is Celeste, a teenage girl from the town of New Brighton on Staten Island, New York, who one day in school is caught up in a horrendous act of violence. It almost kills her and the unfolding of these events delivers a shocking blow right at the start of the film. As a way of working through her trauma, the musically talented Celeste performs a moving and simple song at a commemorative service with her elder sister Eleanor (Stacy Martin), and this instantly becomes a national sensation.A tough-talking, cynical but very competent manager, well played by Jude Law, guides Celeste into a blockbusting pop career (there appears to be no question of continuing her studies), and her music evolves away from its early straightforwardness to something darker, more challenging and more ambiguous. She appears in some Nietzschean way to have absorbed and controlled the violence that did not kill her.Later, when Celeste has grown into a careworn thirtysomething veteran of megastardom, raucous and entitled, and blearily defiant in the face of press denigration, she is played by Portman in an exuberant if rather two-dimensional way. Martin and Law are not replaced, and Cassidy is back playing Celeste’s moody and neglected daughter Albertine, a doppelganger resurgence that doesn’t earn the impact it appears to claim. We see Celeste prepare for a massive comeback concert on her home turf in New York, and having to ignore press reports of a new act of violence for which she may be held responsible.The first act of Vox Lux is queasily inspired: disquieting, exciting, chillingly amoral. It impales you on its ambiguity. Celeste’s almost supernatural ascent to stardom is either a wonderful redemptive process or a delayed symptom of the evil implanted by the original violence, a flowering of darkness in Celeste’s mind, an anti-miracle of daemonic creativity.Cassidy’s coolly self-possessed performance embodies this essential enigma, instinctively holding her own in the face of Law’s crass and bullying advice. Everything about Celeste is mesmerically calm, as if she is starring in a pop music version of Damien Omen II. Celeste appears to be surrounded by omens and portents, particularly the claustrophobic tunnels she’s always travelling down and that feature in her dreams.But then there is the issue of Celeste’s less interesting adult persona, played by Portman, and the giant concert that is effectively the film’s closing scene. How much to acknowledge the real world of pop music is always difficult (a trip to Stockholm involves an unavoidable glimpse of Abba) and of course, showing “fictional” pop music in a film is a challenge, like showing “fictional” paintings by an imaginary artist. How good are we supposed to think Celeste is? How plausible is her music? (Lady Gaga in A Star Is Born surmounted this issue to some degree simply by being the real thing herself.) So how interesting and revelatory is that final big concert?I’m not sure. So much of the voltage of the film had initially rested on wondering where this could all be going, a sense that something was very wrong in founding a pop career on the obscenity of violence. Where it’s going turns out to be … not too dissimilar from the end point of many other pop careers, and the issue of that other act of terrorism that she may have inspired is left unexamined. But what a commanding performance from Cassidy. And Walker’s score offers a sinister caress."
Georgetown review – Christoph Waltz's inglorious directorial debut,"The two-time Oscar winner stumbles with a flat, amateurish drama loosely telling the true story of a devious social climber",2,"There’s an intriguing true story trying to break out of Christoph Waltz’s curiously flat directorial debut. It’s a timely one, too, the story of a pathologically deceitful con artist whose deviously constructed web of bullshit sits him comfortably alongside Elizabeth Holmes and John Meehan, whose schemes have turned them into recent podcast and small-screen sensations, as well as the staggeringly fabricated narrative provided on a daily basis by the American president. We’re compelled not just by garden-variety liars but by the audacity of wildly creative and potentially delusional fantasists, an extreme form of dishonesty that most of us find impossible to identify with.In Georgetown, Waltz is also present in front of the camera as Ulrich Mott, a mysterious German who has slithered his way from a job as a tour guide in DC to the husband of esteemed journalist Elsa Brecht (Vanessa Redgrave), a woman 30 years his senior. Their marriage raises eyebrows in polite society but also raises the suspicion of Elsa’s daughter Amanda (Annette Bening) who is convinced that Ulrich is after her money. After a disastrous dinner party, Elsa is found dead and Ulrich becomes the prime suspect.From the opening few frames through to a clunky introductory sequence, there’s something frustratingly off-balance about Georgetown. Based on a New York Times article yet tweaked and massaged for dramatic effect, there are undeniably fascinating ingredients here but Waltz, credited as film-maker C Waltz, can’t seem to figure out the recipe, his ungainly film desperately missing a much-needed rhythm. Scenes feel like rehearsals, lines read like early drafts, the score is intrusive and staging seems awkward, the end result a clear example of someone biting off far more than they can chew.In Hollywood, Waltz has struggled outside of his Oscar-winning work with Quentin Tarantino. He’s mostly been slumming it as increasingly hammy villains in The Three Musketeers, The Green Hornet, The Legend of Tarzan and Spectre, or he’s fumbled with overblown comedy in Big Eyes and Downsizing. On paper, it’s a relief to see him playing a character with more substance and on a far smaller scale, but it’s not quite the slam-dunk it should have been given his clear passion for the character and the project. His performance isn’t as cartoonish as we’ve come to expect but he never truly convinces us that he’s charming and quick-witted enough to create such an elaborate web of deceit. His lies and his shady behaviour are so thunderingly well-telegraphed that it’s hard to believe he’d even get in the door. In reality, the character who Mott is based on was a teenager when he met his older soon-to-be-wife, and there’s something a tad vain about Waltz taking on the role instead, his underwhelming turn never really justifying to us why this leap was made.Redgrave fares slightly better, her considerable experience helping to lift the film around her whenever she’s on screen. But Bening is left stranded, tonally unsure and stiffly interacting with others as if she were a last-minute replacement. The script, from acclaimed playwright David Auburn, never crackles in the way it should given the underlying tension of the scenario, and too often the odd, this-isn’t-how-people-talk dialogue proves distracting. It goes back to rhythm and Waltz’s inability to give his film any real propulsion. There’s a certain low-level interest given the specifics of the story and our collective obsession with true crime narratives but it’s never enough to divert our attention from Waltz’s amateurish direction. The film looks cheap and feels bland, tied together with crude chapter titles like The Truth, roughly assembled by someone who doesn’t seem sure enough of himself to convince in his recently adopted career.There are a great many fantasies concocted in Georgetown but perhaps the most egregious is that this was the right way to tell such a beguiling story.Georgetown is showing at the Tribeca film festival with a release date yet to be announced"
Breaking Habits review – holy smoke: the nun who runs a marijuana farm,The self-anointed Sister Kate moves to California to start a company producing marijuana for medical use in this messy and amusing documentary,3,"The star of this chirpy, amusing if somewhat glib documentary is Sister Kate, formerly Christine Meeusen, a habit-wearing, self-anointed “nun” and businesswoman born in the American midwest who moved to California and started a thriving marijuana farm.Determined to sell her product only for medical use, which has been legal in the state since 1996 (marijuana was legalised for recreational use in 2016), Kate teamed up with her brother and employed her own kids and various colourful local characters to keep their crop secure as they expanded into other cannabis-derived products. That’s relevant because although weed consumption is semi-legal in California, there is still a thriving black market for it that brings in its wake criminal cartels, armed robberies and shootouts, as well as censorious law enforcement officers and locals who’d rather all this craziness hadn’t invaded their sleepy agricultural community.Made with a scattershot randomness that suggests some of the film-makers may have at the very least got a contact high from all the smoking going on around them, this is a messy if endearing work. Just about everyone seems to be playing to a self-assigned type, be it righteous-but-savvy champion of the afflicted (Kate) who sees herself as an activist, or fire-and-brimstone, anti-drugs preacher like the man of God seen here who decries the toll taken by drugs on the community. The law enforcement officers all look like they came straight out of central casting for a cop show pilot for NRA TV.A little more nuance and historical depth would have been welcome, but this will be serviceable entertainment when it gets to streaming, as long as viewers have a supply on hand."
Spy Cat review – feline crimefighter not up to scratch,A pampered puss hooked on TV cop shows takes the law into her own paws in this unengaging family animation,2,"Actually, there have been real-life feline spies. In the 60s, the CIA wired up cats with microphones and trained them to eavesdrop on its cold-war enemies. The programme, codenamed Acoustic Kitty, had to be abandoned after the first cat on a mission was run over by a taxi and killed. Not a suitable story for family comedy, so we must make do with this energetic, undemanding animation from Germany about a pampered house puss who turns crimefighter.The film wins no prizes for rethinking gender stereotypes. It begins with crazy cat-lady Rosalind mollycoddling and baby-talking her mog Marnie, who is hooked on cop shows. Rosalind’s two previous cats are stuffed and mounted on the wall. (If you’ve ever looked into this, you’ll know that taxidermists advise against stuffing cats. The facial expressions are tricky to get right). When a criminal gang hits town, Marnie investigates. What the poor gullible puss doesn’t realise is that the detective shows she watches on TV are fake. Being one of the good guys isn’t enough:she must find grit and savvy to solve the burglaries. Along the way she picks up a flamboyant zebra, cowardly guard dog and a turkey as her forgettable sidekicks.It’s hard to get your claws out for Spy Cat. There are some decent gags and funny scenes, although I’m not sure the film-makers bothered studying cats before creating their bland feline heroine. Where’s the disdain? The attention seeking? The torture of smaller animals for fun? It’s pleasant enough and entertaining for little kids. (The icky portrayal of sexually frustrated chickens shouting, “Bunga bunga” will go over their heads.)"
Stanley Kubrick: The Exhibition review – from erotic milk bars to haunted hotels,"Design Museum, LondonThis astounding exhibition reveals the obsessive level of genius the great director showed, whether inventing the space age – or restaging the Vietnam war in a London gas works",5,"A photograph of a rambling snow-covered hotel in Oregon is on display in the Design Museum, annotated with the energetic scribbles and emphatic instructions of film director Stanley Kubrick. After sending his set designer to scour America for locations, he had finally settled on the building he would use as the exterior of his haunted hotel in The Shining. Labels stuck liberally across the image explain exactly how he wanted the curving path through the snow to appear in the shot, along with a characteristically stern warning: “THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO DO IT, REPEAT NO OTHER WAY. Exercise the greatest care as the compositional effect of a different path might be BAD BAD BAD.”The photograph provides a glimpse of the obsessive attention to detail and relentless perfectionism that Kubrick brought to his films, a method of total control vividly depicted in this new blockbuster exhibition on his life and work. Featuring over 500 objects – from Ken Adam’s sketches for the War Room in Dr Strangelove, to erotic furniture from the Korova Milk Bar in A Clockwork Orange – the show plunges the visitor headlong into Kubrick’s meticulous, and often disturbing, mind, revealing how he constructed entire worlds from scratch to tell his stories.The first step was always research, and lots of it. Kubrick would spend years immersing himself in the subject at hand until he knew every detail about the characters, events and scientific phenomena he was portraying. As a section on his (unrealised) Napoleon film shows, he produced an index card for every day of the French emperor’s life, with notes about his activities, even down to menu choices. “It was an analogue Wikipedia,” says curator Deyan Sudjic.Sometimes Kubrick’s level of knowledge would land him in trouble. The interiors of the war planes in Dr Strangelove were so detailed that he was suspected of spying. Production designer Ken Adam recalled that “American military personnel visited the set and were terrified by the amount of accuracy we had in this aircraft. We received a memo saying: ‘You had better make sure you know where your references come from or else you might be investigated by the FBI.’”Through the reams of correspondence, sketches, props and notes on show, Kubrick emerges as an omnipotent figure, enjoying complete control over every aspect of his productions, from the design of costumes to promotional posters – as well as an enviable ability to extend both deadlines and budgets. Notes show him haranguing Saul Bass over his designs for The Shining poster (“Hard to read, even at this size” … “Hotel looks too sprawling”), and tweaking the fabric choices of Hardy Amies’ costumes for 2001: A Space Odyssey. The genius of the sci-fi film’s design was that it suggested a plausible future without veering off into fantasy. As Kubrick said of the costumes: “The problem is to find something that looks different and that might reflect new developments in fabrics but that isn’t so far out as to be distracting … Certainly buttons will be gone. Even now, there are fabrics that stick shut by themselves.”The section of the exhibition devoted to 2001 – regarded by many as Kubrick’s crowning achievement – is a thrill, featuring original artwork, model spaceships, costumes and props galore. It includes a miniature mockup of the groundbreaking centrifuge set, a huge 12m-high hamster wheel that allowed scenes to be shot that appear to show the astronauts walking upside down (and which took British manufacturer Vickers-Armstrong six months and more than £580,000 to build).Like every element of the epic film, it gave as accurate a representation as possible of what form the future of space travel might take, based on ideas developed by German rocket scientist Wernher von Braun for a giant spoked wheel that would have rotated around its axis to create artificial gravity for its occupants. Kubrick enhanced the sense of believability through familiarity, using a prodigious amount of product placement, from a Pan Am space shuttle to an Orbiter Hilton Hotel and an IBM tablet – preceding the iPad by 40 years.He had a keen sense of the latest contemporary design and technology, and often exploited its seductive power on film. “There is a sexiness to beautiful machines,” he said, “the smell of a Nikon, the feel of an Italian sports car or a beautiful tape recorder.” This fetishistic attitude to objects comes through in A Clockwork Orange, where the interiors are furnished with pieces that were commercially available at the time but unusual enough to give a sense of the near future. The protagonist’s bedroom features a scarlet Olivetti typewriter designed by Ettore Sottsass, alongside Herman Makkink’s Christ Unlimited sculptures and a futuristic transparent Transcriptor record player, designed by David Gammon.But the polished results were rarely achieved without hiccups. The interiors of the milk bar, where the film opens, were originally going to be designed in collaboration with artist Allen Jones, whose provocative furniture made from submissive female mannequins had caught Kubrick’s eye. Jones even got as far as designing the waitresses’ uniforms for the film, conceiving skintight Lycra dresses with windows cut around the bottom. “I wanted a waitress costume that reflected the fact that, when bringing food, she is functional, and when departing she is decorative,” he said. The two maestros couldn’t agree on a fee, and so Jones’s work – like so many of the carefully prototyped designs elsewhere in the exhibition – was canned.Perhaps the most striking thing that resurfaces throughout the show is how much of the immense trouble that Kubrick went to (and forced others to go through) was undertaken in order to avoid travelling. Despite having had a pilot’s license in his youth, he was scared of flying, so the vast majority of his films were shot in the UK. If he wouldn’t travel then the world would be brought to him, at astonishing lengths.For his celebrated 1987 war film, Full Metal Jacket, Kubrick hired Royal College of Art architecture graduate Anton Furst to transform Beckton Gas Works in London into the Vietnamese city of Huế, using 200 living palm trees flown in from Spain and 100,000 plastic tropical plants from Hong Kong. The Parris Island training camp, meanwhile, was pieced together from a Territorial Army barracks in Bassingbourn, an abandoned airfield in Enfield and an army latrine at Shepperton Studios. Photographs show how Furst proposed to transform Beckton’s 1930s concrete relics into a vaguely southeast Asian-looking cityscape with strategic demolitions and additions.For his final film, Eyes Wide Shut, Kubrick attempted to recreate New York’s Greenwich Village from a collage of streets in London. He dispatched his brother-in-law’s son to assiduously photograph the entire length of Commercial Road, and created a surreal map of Manhattan, labelling each area with the London streets that could be used as stand-ins. It was a jigsaw approach he had used for his 1975 period drama, Barry Lyndon, when, after his team had searched England, Ireland and Germany to find the perfect stately home, they eventually pieced a mythical house together from 12 different sites. “He kept changing his mind, and I was racing around the Irish countryside trying to find locations,” recalled Ken Adam. “When he didn’t like the location, the whole thing would have to be shot again … It was a disaster.”Kubrick’s uncompromising fastidiousness drove many of his collaborators mad, but most agreed that it was usually worth it for the quality of the final product. As Sydney Pollack put it in a 2012 documentary: “‘Perfectionist’ is usually a euphemism for ‘pain in the ass’. Stanley was the first real perfectionist.”Stanley Kubrick: The Exhibition is at the Design Museum, London, from 26 April to 15 September."
Pond Life review – affectionate coming-of-age comedy,Bill Buckhurst’s drama about a bunch of kids on a dead-end estate is very funny about friendship and growing pains but lacks momentum,3,"Theatre director Bill Buckhurst makes his film debut with this semi-gritty portrait of teenagers on a dead-end estate in mid-90s Yorkshire. It’s a drama in the socially conscious tradition of Ken Loach, with echoes of Shane Meadows’s bantering mates and a dollop of Stand By Me nostalgia; it’s sometimes very funny about friendship and growing pains, though often awkward and unconvincing. I found it hard to get beyond the imitation feel – moments here seem lifted from dozens of films you’ve already seen.There are strong performances from the young actors. Tom Varey is saintly Trevor, the oldest of the group, who is in his 20s. He’s lined up a warehouse job in town, but before he moves out of his dad’s, he is planning a night-time fishing trip to catch a whopping 20lb carp said to live in a nearby pond. Rising star Angus Imrie does a mean Spud-from-Trainspotting as lanky space cadet Malcolm. Samantha Morton’s daughter Esme Creed-Miles is Pogo, a damaged child-like teenager who adores Trevor.Creed-Miles does her best with the role, giving an unselfconscious performance, but the character is troubling. Halfway through, something terrible from Pogo’s past is revealed, but it’s unclear whether she’s exhibiting symptoms of severe trauma or mild learning difficulties – or both. Her quirkiness – she carries a tape recorder everywhere and wears a retro red anorak – feels simplistic. And, like all the really big stuff, this event happened before the movie, which makes Pond Life a bit of an uneventful slog.There is some affectionate gentle comedy. One boy is told that fishermen wear women’s tights to keep warm, but his mum only has stockings to lend him, leading to a couple of nice scenes. That said, a quiz-night compere mispronouncing the French word fromage hits the wrong note, coming across as laughing-at-them ungenerous."
Wheely review – shameless Cars rip-off skids along the hard shoulder,This uninspired animation drives in Pixar’s slipstream and holds an ethos dangerously out of step with the times,1,"The makers of this brash and blaringly noisy family animation from Malaysia give the hot-rod rookie storyline from Pixar’s Cars a hasty respray and set it off so fast they hope nobody notices the similarities. But it really is such a blatant copycat job, ripping off Cars note for note and lifting so many elements – from talking driverless cars to the dim-witted, buck-toothed sidekick – they might as well have called it Carz.Ogie Banks cheerfully voices Wheely, a cocksure young racing car who crashes badly, busting his axel beyond repair. His speeding days over, Wheely takes a job as a taxi – and with his career go his chances of impressing supermodel Bella (Frances Lee), a lipstick-red Ferrari-like sporty number. Besides, she’s already hooked up with a preening posh-boy motor. Oh bolts! The plot goes a bit Fast & Furious when an international criminal racket run by truck Kaiser (Brock Powell) car-naps Bella.Wheely dashes to her rescue in a plotline with a depressingly vintage approach to female characters. (It’s worth remembering that a 2017 study found that girls already think they are less capable than boys by the time they are six years old.) Conventional wisdom about Pixar movies has it that the Cars franchise contains the least inventive films in the back catalogue, but the bland anthropomorphism and patience-testingly unfunny script here really do go to show how many laps ahead of the competition Pixar is. And you’ve got to wonder in the current zeitgeist, as certainties about global warming get more dire and kids turn eco warrior, whether movies celebrating gas-guzzling cars have reached the end of the road."
Homecoming review – Beyoncé documentary is a triumphant celebration,"The Netflix film, featuring rehearsal and live footage of her 2018 Coachella performance, is one of the all-time great concert docs",5,"Throughout Homecoming, the new Netflix documentary chronicling Beyoncé’s monumental performance at the 2018 Coachella music festival, quotes from distinguished black creatives and intellectuals appear at various points, serving as interstitial title cards between footage of the concert and its tireless gestation. They include WEB DuBois, Nina Simone, Toni Morrison and Reginald Lewis, suggesting not only Beyoncé’s reverence for her forerunners but her own by-now-unequivocal stature in the pantheon of black American greatness.The most potent of these quotes, however, the one most illustrative of the resplendent and genuinely paradigm-shifting show Beyoncé put on in Indio, comes from Audre Lorde. “Without community,” Lorde said in a speech delivered exactly 40 years ago, “there is no liberation.” Beyoncé, joined on stage by more than 200 performers, turns that soundbite into triumphant roar, crafting an experience whose emphasis on the whole – the masterfully synchronized and color-coordinated corps of dancers, back-up singers, majorettes, trumpet players, et al – gives it the feeling of visual, aural communion.And yet, despite her willingness to share the stage, Beyoncé is the priestess, the ringleader, insistent on her authorship of this one-of-a-kind spectacle, which marked the first time a black woman had ever headlined Coachella. The writer, director and executive producer of Homecoming, which runs 137 minutes and was released in concert with a 40-song live album, Beyoncé has a way of reminding us of her unique ability to hold a crowd in the palm of her hand, to defy the trend toward cultural diffusion and force us to stand at attention.She did it first in 2013, with the surprise drop of her eponymous visual album. Then again with Lemonade, for which I and countless others forsook our Saturday night plans to watch immediately, as though it were some kind of presidential fireside chat. Coachella 2018 was her hat-trick, and Homecoming, with its savvy structure and breakneck editing, is a joyful celebration of the performance, if not quite the look-behind-the-curtain one expects of the typical concert documentary.This is, after all, Beyoncé, and her capacity for era-defining moments wouldn’t be what it is if she didn’t defend her right to privacy, to a room of her own. There’s no salacious backstage powwow with her dancers or simulations of oral sex on an Evian bottle, like Madonna in one of the all-time greats of the form, Truth or Dare. Nor is it the kind of scaled-back, cinéma vérité experience of Stop Making Sense, Jonathan Demme’s Talking Heads rockumentary. Homecoming is directed and performed with exacting precision, but it’s freewheeling too, its star favoring spliced and inventive arrangements of her hits, the totality of which make the film feel more like a pinnacle than a pilgrimage. Beyoncé speaks mostly in voiceover, maintaining a kind of phantom presence even in those rare moments of vulnerability, such as the revelations about her difficult pregnancy with twins, or her lifelong dream of attending an HBCU like her father. “My college was Destiny’s Child,” she says. “My college was traveling around the world, and life was my teacher.”So Coachella, she explains, was the homecoming she never had, but also a paean to the rich culture and vibrant aesthetic of historically black colleges and universities, the insignia of which can be spotted on the bright yellow and pink hoodies worn by Beyoncé and her onstage battalion (the film brilliantly cross-cuts between Beyoncé’s two Coachella sets to create an almost kaleidoscopic effect, edited down to each gyration and stutter-step). And even with the relative sparsity of information about how the concept came together, Homecoming is, alongside the southern gothic feminism of Lemonade, Beyoncé’s grandest articulation yet of her artistic mission. It’s a mission so great, she looks to no less an authority than Maya Angelou to put it into words. “What I really want to do is be a representative of my race,” Angelou says over grainy rehearsal footage near the end of the documentary, in what was the last interview she gave before her death in 2014. “I know that when I’m finished doing what I’m sent here to do, I will be called home.”Home, for Beyoncé, is the stage. It simply agrees with her, as does every light source, camera angle and audience member, many of whom are seen howling blissfully in the crowd, gobsmacked with pride and hero-worship. But Beyoncé, queen she may be, doesn’t ask us to bend the knee. Homecoming is about the collective. It’s about the experience of viral, transitory togetherness for which musical festivals are one of the last remaining conduits. Beyoncé lets us see as much of the sweat as she’s willing, and some will perhaps want more. But she’s less interested in unraveling the mythology than letting us plebeians revel in it.Homecoming is now available on Netflix"
Let There Be Light review – Christian conversion drama is cinematic heresy,Kevin ‘Hercules’ Sorbo stars as an atheist who finds God in a humourless tale full of flimsy characters and flimsier acting,2,"‘Jesus got whacked, badda boom. Then the body disappeared.” That’s the Easter story in a nutshell according to pastor Vinny (Michael Franzese), a wiseguy turned man of the cloth. Pastor Vinny is a brief chink of humour in this speechy, preachy Christian-themed movie – to be filed in the subgenre of conversion dramas about militant atheists finding God. It’s produced by Fox News host Sean Hannity, and the director is Kevin “Hercules” Sorbo, who also stars as a sneering liberal intellectual frequently introduced on the lecture circuit as “the world’s most famous atheist”. He’s called Dr Sol Harkens (sounds a bit like Dawkins, no?).An almighty whiff of phoniness hangs over proceedings – not least in Sorbo’s portrayal of Sol, who looks and behaves more like the dishy doctor in a daytime soap than a rock-star intellectual. His marriage to Kate (Sam Sorbo) has recently collapsed under the strain of losing their eight-year-old son to cancer. After the launch party for his latest God-bashing bestseller, Sol drunkenly drives his car into a wall. In the ambulance, clinically dead for four minutes, his dead son appears to him in a glowing tunnel full of memories – it looks like a giant digital photo frame. Naturally, Sol’s fans and the media are champing to know what he saw during his near-death experience. After a quick chat with his doctor – for an intellectual, he’s bizarrely incurious about the neurological explanations – Sol meets Pastor Vinny, embraces God and pours the vodka down the sink.Everyone here emotes like they’re acting in an electric toothbrush ad. But in truth, Let There Be Light isn’t the most awful faith-based movie ever made. At the very least it has a consistency: as an atheist, Sol is a raging narcissist, as a Christian he believes God has chosen him to spread His message – like a second son."
Someone Great review - another run-of-the-mill romcom from Netflix,"Despite fine performances from Gina Rodriguez and Lakeith Stanfield, the debut film from Jennifer Kaytin Robinson never strays from the genre’s cliches",2,"Someone Great, a new Netflix original comedy written and directed by the first-time film-maker Jennifer Kaytin Robinson, is the kind of movie that’s both undeniably of its time and still curiously rote. At times it plays like an uninterrupted torrent of memes and millennialisms, as though its attention to the parlance and particularities of contemporary urban life might disguise the fact that it’s otherwise a standard, paint-by-the-numbers buddy-romcom, in which three girlfriends – two are on the heels of a breakup; the third has sworn off committed relationships – ring in their sisterhood and their sorrows at a trendy music festival.Characters juul ad nauseum. They compare respective houses in Hogwarts. They say things like “slide into my DMs” and “tastemakers’ brunch” or name-drop Liz Lemon and Lady Bird. There’s potential here for a kind of zeitgeisty farce – The Sweetest Thing revamped for the age of memes – and yet Someone Great manages to undermine its capacity for novelty at almost every turn, remaining sadly compliant with the beats of the genre it seeks to uproot.And those beats, they arrive when you most expect them: the meditative, post-breakup walk in the park, set, as ever, to a soothing acoustic guitar; the epiphanies about men, friends, growth and independence; the expository supercut of pictures and text messages that tells the story of a relationship (and is soundtracked, literally, by Lorde’s song Supercut). The only parts of Someone Great that don’t seem reverse-engineered by a Netflix algorithm are the performances, which tap into the delinquent buoyancy of a quarter-life crisis and very nearly defy the movie’s symphony of cliches.Chief among them is Gina Rodriguez, whose comic timing is instinctual and sharp, a bit Aniston-like in its easy charm. Playing Jenny, a music journalist whose new job at Rolling Stone requires her to move to San Francisco and end her nine-year relationship with Nate (a reliably solid Lakeith Stanfield), Rodriguez proves her leading-lady bona fides as confidently as she did on six seasons of the CW sitcom Jane the Virgin, which airs its series finale this spring. The punchlines aren’t anything to write home about, but Rodriguez delivers them with exuberant spontaneity, or while drinking bourbon from a pretzel straw. “Lies-ah Minnelli,” she says to her best friend Erin, a relationship agoniste who insists she hasn’t caught feelings for the woman she’s been dating but whose behavior suggests otherwise.Erin is played by the charismatic DeWanda Wise, who hit the big time in 2017 with her leading role on Netflix’s TV adaptation of Spike Lee’s film She’s Gotta Have It. Wise and Brittany Snow – rounding out the trio in the sweet-and-sour sidekick role that’s become her stock-in-trade – are given substantive storylines of their own, preventing the movie from stewing too long in Jenny’s post-split ennui, which is mostly assuaged, as it were, by drugs, alcohol and tickets to Neon Classic. That’s the name of the music festival where the women plan one final hurrah before Jenny moves out west – it also might have been a better and less willfully abstract title for the film, but I digress. First, anyway, they have to get to Neon Classic in one piece.Along the way they encounter RuPaul, who – clears throat – plays a clairvoyant molly dealer named Hype, the owner of multiple baby sharks and three obedient chihuahuas. Mother Ru has the funniest cameo in a movie featuring several: there’s also Rosario Dawson, as a fashion magazine snob, and the up-and-coming comedian Jaboukie Young-White, who glides around an unreasonably spacious SoHo loft on a hoverboard, as if plucked straight from a thinkpiece about millennials killing such-and-such industry. Robinson’s zippy writing traffics in these kinds of caricatures, but too often the very fact of exaggeration functions as a substitute for humor rather than a springboard for something sharper and more surprising. A preferable tack for this sort of generation-specific comedy might have been that of Ingrid Goes West, a film whose tropes are torqued to the point of genuine toxicity.Yes, Someone Great is doing something different, more uplifting and benign, but it’s also covering well-trodden ground. Never once is the fate of its central friendship in doubt, nor is the prospect of enlightenment, which, when it comes, has all the boilerplate profundity of a refrigerator magnet. If you can, however, stay for the soundtrack, for the amiable presence of Gina Rodriguez, and for a few minutes of RuPaul, lounging on a leopard-print couch with an extravagantly large blunt in hand."
Amazon Adventure review – a microscope in the rainforest,"Following the true story of scientist Henry Bates in the 1840s, this satisfying film uses Imax tech to provide astonishing wildlife detail ",3,"In places, this satisfying Imax edutainment brings forth happy memories of James Gray’s excellent The Lost City of Z. It’s a tribute to another overshadowed historical figure, that of Henry Walter Bates, the Leicester-born amateur scientist – and Alfred Wallace associate – who struck out for the Amazon in 1848, charged with collecting insects at threepence per bug, and in so doing indirectly gathered the evolutionary proofs that backed up Darwin’s On the Origin of Species. What Bates (embodied here by an engaging Calum Finlay) observed in these parts – when he wasn’t bleary-eyed from malaria – were “leaves that could fly, bird droppings that could walk”: ie those craftier critters whose predator-bamboozling camouflage was so well-developed they hadn’t previously been spotted. This is what scientists call “Batesian mimicry”.Director Mike Slee (who enjoyed a big Imax hit with the Judi Dench-narrated Bugs! in 2003) and screenwriters Carl Knutson and Wendy MacKeigan recognise that Bates’s fieldwork might itself pass usefully for Saturday morning matinee fare. Verdant Brazilian location work plunges us from the opening moments into a fully immersive jungle environment, complete with such adventure-movie staples as shipwrecks, hungry leopards and mischievous monkeys. Yet the team also find smart and invariably visual means of illustrating their human subject’s breakthroughs. When a chain of stereoscopic butterflies flutters across our field of vision, each insect bearing similar yet subtly distinct markings, it’s the 3D equivalent of a lightbulb moment: you feel you could literally grasp Bates’s working method.Possibly the first-person narration holds a little too closely to the earnest tone of this wonder-boy’s letters home; the youngsters around me at the press screening grew restless towards the end of an otherwise brisk 40 minutes, as the cuddly animals receded from view, and Bates returns to civilisation to prove Darwin right in the face of a harrumphing popular press. Yet the film sets about its task in the same spirit of wide-eyed wonder as its subject, using movie art to bolster its science, and thereby retooling the Imax screen to serve as a high-powered microscope. Under Slee’s direction, even the teensiest creepy crawlies find themselves noted and taxonomized; it’s encouraging to see a format that generally sets audiences to non-specific gawping attempting to focus and refine our gaze."
Mid90s review – Jonah Hill's nostalgic nod to the mean streets of his youth,Skaters vie for status in a directorial debut that mixes Scorsese-like extravagance with moments of smartly observed subtlety,3,"Skateboarding movies look as if they’ve absorbed the aesthetic of skateboarding itself: reckless, affectless, directionless and anaesthetised, the kind of activity where it’s important to mask pain if you fall heavily on the asphalt, though the pain is there. They have created a distinct style of their own over the years, since the mid-90s, in fact: a kind of indie-stonewashed, handheld moviemaking, lit as it were from the glow of a setting sun across an empty parking lot, and filmed as if by the participants themselves or by someone too old to be hanging out with them. For his debut movie as a writer-director, 35-year-old Jonah Hill has come up with an accomplished and watchable film in this style, nearly a pastiche, about a very male world as these films generally are (although Crystal Moselle’s recent Skate Kitchen challenged this stereotype).It’s a coming-of-age film in its way. Stevie (played by Sunny Suljic) is a 12-year-old in 90s Los Angeles from an unhappy family. He lives with his single mom Dabney (Katherine Waterston) and his boorish elder brother Ian – an atypically brutish Lucas Hedges – who bullies Stevie with punches that Hill cranks up on the soundtrack so the impact sounds like a bone snapping.One summer, Stevie finds himself hanging out at a skateboard shop with the kind of laid-back proto-hoodlums who are the stuff of his mother’s nightmares: Ruben (Gio Galicia), Fuckshit (Olan Prenatt), Ray (Na-kel Smith) and Fourth Grade (Ryder McLaughlin). Hill himself may identify with young Stevie, or perhaps with Fourth Grade who is forever filming everyone with his video camera and is shyly embarrassed about his own career hopes, modestly announcing he may just follow in his dad’s footsteps at the Department of Motor Vehicles.Hill shows how the skaters are to be Stevie’s alternative family, and when his charm and courageous skating cause him to be lavishly accepted by these cool kids five years older than he is, it causes sibling rivalry with Ruben, an envy made worse by his precocious sexual success with a much older girl (a wish-fulfilment scene that male directors often go in for). Ray is the group’s de facto leader, and when he appears to be disloyally drifting away from them for some older and yet cooler skaters, it creates something akin to a power vacuum, filled by Fuckshit, who masks his hurt feelings by drinking even more than usual, and is, worryingly, the group’s designated driver.Mid90s is a film in two distinct traditions: there is the rhetoric of something like the mid-90s film Kids, directed by Larry Clark and written by Harmony Korine – Korine has a knowingly contrived cameo here – or Gus Van Sant films such as Paranoid Park or Elephant.This is the less-than-zero world of young people operating outside parental supervision and at the margins of the law. Tellingly, there is a scene in which the group taunt a security guard, an authority figure who isn’t even a cop, but who gets in a few verbal licks of his own, jeering that Fuckshit looks like Sheryl Crow – although the skaters lack the irony gene that makes them seriously vulnerable to this kind of mockery.Less obviously, and maybe even less consciously, Mid90s is part of another tradition leading from Fellini’s I Vitelloni (1953) to Scorsese’s Mean Streets (1973) and beyond: the story of a bunch of young guys captured at a moment of intense friendship when youth is about to vanish for ever. Hill worked with Scorsese on The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) and he puts GoodFellas (1990) on the TV in one scene here. He has a very Scorsesesque habit of showing us a group shot with a big juke-box slam on the soundtrack – in this case, the Mamas and the Papas’ version of Dedicated to the One I Love.Hill is punctilious with earnestly observed retro detail, and sometimes this is a bit heavy-handed. Did Ian really have to wear a Bill Clinton fright mask? These are the moments when Mid90s starts to look like a film-school graduation project. An impressive one, though.I enjoyed it more when Hill showed a lighter touch. At his 18th birthday celebration, Ian ostentatiously declines to thank Stevie for his present. Later, Ruben will tell Stevie it isn’t manly or cool to thank anyone for anything — a lesson poor Stevie accepts with saucer-eyed credulity, but which Ray will later tell him is complete nonsense. Of course he should thank people for the nice things they do. Almost by accident, Stevie is getting a kind of education."
Sky and Ground review – refugee family's nail-biting trek from war,"In this warmly humane documentary, three generations of one resourceful Syrian family head for Germany on foot",3,"‘You’re skinny. I’ll feed you falafel for a month when you get here.” A Syrian teenager stranded in a refugee camp near the Greece-Macedonia border is video chatting with her cousin who’s made it to Berlin in this humane, extremely watchable documentary that follows three generations of one family as they leave the camp on foot carrying all their belongings on a 3,000km journey to Germany. First they were bombed out of Aleppo, everything they had stolen by war. Now they must sneak across Europe like thieves.The star of show is “uncle Guevara”, Abdallah Nabi – the group’s de facto leader. Guevara is a charismatic guy in his early 30s equipped with a bandana and restless energy. A student in Aleppo when war broke out, he became an activist, filming the regime’s bomb attacks on the city. Now, as the family wade through rivers, he spends most of his time dissuading the others from phoning smugglers – who make big bucks from empty promises of a safe passage to Germany for 800 euros a person.As the world’s attention drifts away from the refugee crisis, Sky and Ground has a conscience-prodding effect. And it works because more than anything it’s portrait of a family who are funny, full of warmth and possess a miraculous ability to rustle up a cheese and pitta feast on the side of a hill. There’s an ongoing joke about tossing little cousin Rita’s cuddly toy in the bin; they’re down to survival basics, so how on earth is she still carrying a fluffy pink dog?In Germany, Guevara’s brothers chew their nails, tracking the slow progress on GPS with their mobiles. In this Berlin footage, the TV tower pokes up out of the skyline like a modern Statue of Liberty welcoming the tired – if only they can get there."
Yuli: The Carlos Acosta Story review – unflinching biopic of a ballet superstar,This energetic account of the life of the electrifying Cuban never shies away from the truth about his tough upbringing,3,"This energetic, emotionally reflective movie follows the rise of the Cuban dancer Carlos Acosta from scrappy juvenile tearaway to ballet superstar. It’s directed by Icíar Bollaín from a script by Ken Loach regular Paul Laverty that adapts the dancer’s memoir. Acosta even makes an appearance, playing himself now, in Cuba to put on a show about his life – a clever move by Laverty to include some electrifying performances.The film’s great find is 10-year-old newcomer Edlison Manuel Olbera Núñez, who struts around as young Carlos with irrepressible energy. In a reverse of the Billy Elliott story, it’s his dad Pedro (Santiago Alfonso), who drags Carlos kicking and screaming to Havana’s state ballet school to get him off the streets – and gives him the nickname Yuli, a legendary warrior. The teachers instantly recognise this cocky kid’s natural talent. But Carlos is not convinced – he’d rather be playing football than flouncing about in tights. His commitment to ballet is semi-detached at best. Pedro is his biggest cheerleader and an overbearing bully, beating him with a leather belt for skipping classes.The childhood scenes are so vibrant, it’s almost a shame when Keyvin Martinez (a dancer in Acosta’s company) picks up the role of Carlos in his late teens. Ballet is his ticket out of poverty, but his loneliness at being separated from his family is agonising, even as he notches up accolades – famously becoming the Royal Ballet’s first black Romeo.Acosta’s own appearances here are lumbered with some clunky dialogue – though the three or four autobiographical dance sequences he choreographs (particularly one in which he performs the role of his father) are extraordinary. What’s perhaps surprising given the insider involvement from Acosta is the film’s insight and emotional generosity that extends even to overbearing Pedro. This isn’t one of those biopics that rearranges a life to hide the ugly awkward bits."
Missing Link review – animated bigfoot caper trips up,Laika studio’s fifth lovingly crafted family movie brims with visual charm and energy but gets bogged down in an unengaging narrative,3,"Animation studio Laika is the artisanal cheese-maker of kids’ movies – labouring painstakingly to create a fine brie while the competition is mostly churning out Dairylea triangles. The studio’s fifth feature, a bigfoot adventure in the style of Indiana Jones, gently sends up the world of Victorian gentlemen explorers – ridiculous toffs trotting off to exotic climes with their silk cravats and oversized male egos. It’s pulled off with charm and energy, and the period detail is beyond gorgeous. But, for all that, in places Missing Link feels disappointingly average, with too much tiresome capering and slapsticky fisticuffs.Hugh Jackman voices Sir Lionel Frost, a twittish old Etonian monster-hunter whose wacky belief in the existence of the Loch Ness monster has made him a laughing stock. When he receives a letter tipping him off about a bigfoot in the wilds of America, Frost sees a chance to prove himself to the walrus-moustached old duffers at the explorers’ society. But the letter, it turns out, was written by the bigfoot himself (Zach Galifianakis), the last of his kind, a goofily adorable 8ft apeman who wants Frost to escort him to the Himalayas to live with his long-lost Yeti cousins.Laika established its reputation with spooky-ooky kid horrors such as ParaNorman and Boxtrolls. Breaking with house style completely, this is brighter and funnier. The film’s eccentric characters and meticulously constructed world – all William Morris wallpaper and Savile Row tweed – feels more Wes Anderson than Tim Burton. It’s a feast of a movie with dazzling visuals and terrifically acted by the voice cast.But the storytelling is unevolved compared with the animation. I would have liked more of Emma Thompson as the queen of the Yeti, ruling over a Utopian land of knuckle-draggers like a bored, semi-deranged cult leader. Hers are some of most fun scenes, squeezed into end of the film after all the snoozy chases."
Holy Lands review – misjudged Jewish pig-farmer drama,James Caan plays an unhappy New Yorker starting a ludicrously inappropriate new life in Israel,2,"A good performance from Tom Hollander can’t save this stodgy, ungainly and strangely reactionary family drama from the French writer-director Amanda Sthers, whose sticky Parisian comedy Madame was released here last year.James Caan plays Harry, an ageing Jewish guy who is estranged from his wife and grown-up children, and has left New York for Nazareth in Israel, to breed pigs, of all the hilariously inappropriate things. Why? To annoy everyone, and maybe even annoy himself, in some restlessly unhappy way. His son David (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is a dramatist and a gay man who has a play on Broadway about his exasperating old dad, based on the unanswered letters that he is sending him. Harry’s daughter Annabelle (Efrat Dor) is a neurotic thirtysomething still dependent on an allowance from Harry for her analyst’s bills. (Maybe all she needs is a man to give her a baby.) And Harry’s wife (Rosanna Arquette) has troubles of her own.Out in Israel, Harry has a testy confrontation with Moshe (Hollander), a worldly, witty rabbi who initially objects to his pig-farming. But they then go from this antagonism to an out-and-out odd-couple bromance without any convincing psychological explanation or plausible bridging scene. And are we heading for some resolution? A reunion of Harry with his wife and family?Well, in a way, though Sthers’s screenplay feels as if she is fudging the issue rather than addressing the messy compromises of real life. Her script has conservative-minded Harry brooding about the mental images of his children that he carries around: “In my mind, David doesn’t kiss other men on the mouth …” A misjudged touch, that. One among many."
Nervous Translation review – child's-eye view of a perplexing world,"In Shireen Seno’s opaque but beautiful drama, an eight-year-old Filipina finds a pen she believes responds to people’s feelings",3,"Nervous Translation from the Filipino artist and film-maker Shireen Seno (a former stills photographer for Lav Diaz) is a challenging film for the head and the heart, difficult to decode and to respond to emotionally. The title does not really help: nobody is “nervous” exactly – anxious, concerned, yes – and “translation” doesn’t precisely describe what is going on. But, as a slice of life, as a direct transcription of a child’s-eye view of the world, it is intriguingly and lovingly detailed.The setting is the Philippines in the late 1980s, just after the end of President Ferdinand Marcos’s two decades in power. Yael (Jana Agoncillo) is an eight-year-old girl who is often alone at home after school before her mum Val (Angge Santos) comes back from a hard day’s work. Val’s husband, Yael’s dad, is away working in Saudi Arabia and communicates by sending intense audio tapes that Yael covertly listens to, not quite understanding the very adult expressions of confessional yearning. Her husband’s identical twin brother, Tino (Sid Lucero), comes around, and Yael uncomprehendingly picks up on the tension there, too.The rest of the time, she telephones her friend to do maths quizzes, or watches soaps with her mum. (In an ambiguous quasi-fantasy scene, the soap is shown to be filmed locally, and Yael makes a strange contribution.) She becomes mildly obsessed with a new Japanese brand of pen, which she comes to believe responds to people’s feelings: this, perhaps, is the “translation”. Touchingly, Yael has a tiny doll’s oven, in which a candle can be placed, and which she can use to “cook” tiny scaled-down meals – because her absent dad keeps saying how much he misses Val’s cooking.There is a remarkable quasi-fantasy scene showing an entire child’s model of their apartment and the surrounding area: did Yael make that? Or imagine it? Is this what is happening in her head? An opaque, but beautifully composed film."
2040 review – an idealist's vision of a healthy Earth,Damon Gameau’s upbeat documentary predicts our best selves saving the planet but would have been better as a TV series,3,"Nobody predicted the immense success of Australian Damon Gameau’s 2015 directorial debut, That Sugar Film, a candy-coloured, Supersize Me-esque documentary exploring the effects of consuming sugar while on a supposedly healthy diet. It was a smash hit in its home country, becoming the highest grossing non-Imax Australian documentary in history (since overtaken by Jennifer Peedom’s majestic 2017 doco Mountain).Perhaps we shouldn’t have been surprised. Gameau took an issue relevant across cultures and demographics, and prised it open with a broadly accessible style that neither bored nor talked down to young people – who form much of his target demographic.The director-presenter inhabited the role of a cool school teacher doing what all cool teachers aspire to do: making education fun.For his follow-up film 2040, which had its Australian premiere this week at the Gold Coast film festival, Gameau turns his focus to the health of the planet, keeping broadly the same upbeat approach. While That Sugar Film contained horrific visions of dental apocalypse that no doubt compelled young’uns to brush their teeth out of sheer, gum-gobbling terror, the overall message remained optimistic – emphasising the power we have to shape our bodies and lives.Similarly, when applying the stethoscope to the earth’s wellbeing, Gameau positions himself as a glass-half-full idealist, with his first mission to convince people that they can make a difference.Dividing his focus into key areas, including renewable energy and alternative transportation, with corresponding on-the-road case studies, he structures the film as a one-way conversation with his four-year-old daughter, who will be 25 when the titular year arrives and, he hopes, part of a brighter and better world.The outlook of the film is refreshing. There’s no shortage of gooseflesh-raising documentaries that tell us, not without justification, that the world is going – or has already gone – to the dogs.“I think there’s room for a different story,” Gameau says, in the garden with shovel in hand, near the beginning of the film. It is peppered with Kids Say the Darndest Things-type interviews – pipsqueaks discussing their ideal solutions to the world’s problems. Presumably Gameau was delighted by the sight of thousands of Australian kids walking out of school last month, protesting against the government’s inaction on fossil fuel emissions.The overarching approach of 2040 is not unlike aTV program, such as Todd Sampson’s Redesign My Brain, in which an engaging host tracks down experts who have spent their lives researching subjects that are relatively new to the presenter.Gameau’s pitch is that he has the skills to distil complex ideas into thoroughly digestible chunks. This is where we see his auteurial voice emerging – creating visual innovations that add some bling to potentially dry subject matter.For instance, he gives interviewees the Honey, I Shrunk the Kids treatment, reducing them to tiny figurines in aesthetically engaging environments –on a Monopoly board or perched atop a shovel.But given the episodic nature of 2040, and the complexity of each topic – all of which could easily form entire documentaries themselves – it is clear that a feature-length film isn’t the ideal format.A television series, with an episode per subject, would make an obviously more accommodating format. Although, given how well That Sugar Film went down, it is hardly a surprise that the producers decided to try and replicate its success.A series would have given Gameau room to expand areas that are largely absent from his remit, such as the hurdles of revolutionising power grids, or replacing all cars with self-driving group rideshare vehicles. Or even, in a perhaps unfathomably optimistic thought, the end of billboard advertising.It’s understandable why the film-maker didn’t want to get bogged down in tackling those awfully adult, awfully sobering ideas of vested interests, which in a nutshell explain many of the aforementioned hurdles. In 2040, Gameau defaults to the position of inspiring people rather than alarming or overwhelming them. You leave the film wanting more, not less, of these sorts of productions."
